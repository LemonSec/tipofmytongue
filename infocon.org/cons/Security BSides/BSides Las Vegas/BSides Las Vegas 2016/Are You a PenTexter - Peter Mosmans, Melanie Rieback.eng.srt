1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,220
and apache fob and those two tools are

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,710
necessary to<font color="#E5E5E5"> convert all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> XML files</font>

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,170
and your content into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the PDF reports</font>

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,870
the first thing you need is of course

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,950
content as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> technical writer for</font>

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,919
instance if you're writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quote</font>

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,049
you'll need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> add</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some details of what</font>

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,960
the customer wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be tested when etc</font>

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,000
etc and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> for pen test you need</font>

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,099
to scan outputs you need to findings non

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,279
findings all the content that make up a

12
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">beautiful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pen test report by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,030
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really quick quick note this is</font>

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you need to set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the back end</font>

15
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,230
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically this is what you set up on</font>

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,600
the server side the nice thing about

17
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,398
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> then at that point there's hooks</font>

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,079
into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chat room so any new people</font>

19
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you introduced to your pen testing</font>

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,440
team whether their pen testers or

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,690
technical writers at that point actually

22
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,610
have to set up<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely nothing really</font>

23
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">all they have to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is issue commands in</font>

24
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,050
a chat room as we are about<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

25
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,940
demonstrate which then will launch<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

26
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,739
entire system but essentially these

27
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,180
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the steps now that the</font>

28
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,870
sysadmin has to go through and setting

29
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:09,289
up the whole system so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a small</font>

30
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">setup</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a diagram</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> demo setup</font>

31
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,770
you

32
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:29,000
system in which we also use it and

33
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,710
everything is open source so and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

34
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,700
point that we're all towards the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of</font>

35
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the talk i'll be talking about some</font>

36
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,430
other automations and hooks and things

37
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,860
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to also be adding and we</font>

38
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,320
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of again see this as an ecosystem</font>

39
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,540
so yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now you could say</font>

40
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,700
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentax repository if you look</font>

41
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,940
it up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the github it not only contains</font>

42
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,950
the XML files etc each other to build

43
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,500
the PDF files but also for instance

44
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:54,050
contains content snippets that you can

45
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,360
use and reuse for your pen test reports

46
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,740
but also for quotes it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> contains the</font>

47
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,560
chat up scripts that we're using and

48
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,390
demoing right now so it's an umbrella

49
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,700
term so to speak so we are giving away

50
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,469
all of our boiler plates I mean all of

51
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,229
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is creative commons we are giving</font>

53
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,250
findings of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of genericized findings</font>

54
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:17,210
you know that our<font color="#E5E5E5"> pentester library that</font>

55
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,530
we use internally so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all of</font>

56
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:21,859
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of under</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the umbrella of</font>

57
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:25,190
what we're calling pen text so we offer

58
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,960
a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> services the one most being</font>

59
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:30,350
requested being pen testing but we also

60
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,599
do stress testing load testing source

61
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,340
code analysis etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tehran what I'm going</font>

62
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show you right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now is how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a</font>

63
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:40,710
quote for a pen test and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

64
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:43,080
default quote that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use</font>

65
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,760
so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to ask russ was once</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

66
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,070
politely to set us up a framework

67
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,740
containing all kinds of boilerplate

68
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:55,400
snippets ready to be used in a quote for

69
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,400
a pen test<font color="#E5E5E5"> rosebud quick scope</font>

70
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:01,139
with the name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the repository that was</font>

71
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:03,599
just created of demo

72
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:06,120
and now at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> background it's setting</font>

73
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:07,740
up an<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML file the source file that's</font>

74
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,110
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used to create the PDF file</font>

75
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,599
from and it will contain all kinds of

76
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,939
links to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the snippets in the Pantex</font>

77
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:17,430
framework yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nice thing also</font>

78
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:20,039
is that it goes from basically a quick

79
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,689
scope xml file which is basically an a4

80
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,370
is worth of<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML in which you can just</font>

81
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:27,180
sort of fill<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some basic things it</font>

82
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:28,499
generates basically a larger again it<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

83
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,930
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> need change they but right now</font>

84
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:32,340
it's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fair</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tada xml in which if</font>

85
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,960
you then want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do for example a</font>

86
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,359
non-standard quotation then you can

87
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,698
basically edify edit it as as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

88
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,319
see fit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then at that point you can</font>

89
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:42,569
use that to generate a PDF as we're

90
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to show so in the background this</font>

91
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:47,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the repository that we just created</font>

92
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:51,270
using cheddar brats<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to be exact</font>

93
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:53,879
these are all directories containing

94
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,770
various bits of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pentax framework I'm</font>

95
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:58,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to show you all of them the</font>

96
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,599
basic file that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> technical writer is</font>

97
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:03,900
going to use can be found in the source

98
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:06,900
directory and as we are now creating a

99
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:12,320
quote it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in called affair</font>

100
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:17,120
to xml and as Melanie told touch

101
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:19,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">feta is a Dutch word meaning quote so</font>

102
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">using the kid lab web interface I could</font>

103
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:25,160
do this on my own workstation<font color="#E5E5E5"> repository</font>

104
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,550
and open and fancy editor like VI or

105
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:31,400
emacs and do the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not using the</font>

106
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:35,590
direct web interface to immediately edit

107
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,590
the file in the git repository itself

108
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,950
edit the file

109
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:47,140
this is eligible for anyone equity read

110
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:50,230
this the customer requested a pen test

111
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:53,349
for us so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add the targets</font>

112
00:07:50,230 --> 00:08:02,310
that we're going to pen test say ballast

113
00:07:53,350 --> 00:08:02,310
Point's / targets and stone / target

114
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:09,120
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add the duration of the pen</font>

115
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,860
test ballast point<font color="#CCCCCC"> and stoner rather</font>

116
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,190
large company so I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set the</font>

117
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:19,650
duration for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten days of the pen test</font>

118
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:23,460
and also important how much we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

119
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:26,219
to charge the customer so by merely

120
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,710
editing this source file in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pentax</font>

121
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:32,419
repository we're now able as we did the

122
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:34,860
first step content to build a PDF quote

123
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:37,228
it's also worth mentioning<font color="#E5E5E5"> that also</font>

124
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,849
we're taking including a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

125
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:40,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">different snippets from different</font>

126
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:43,290
locations all of which are modifiable

127
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,510
also to meet your own needs there's also

128
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,880
sort of a customer database also which

129
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,360
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> collection of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> XML files and we have</font>

130
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,540
a fictional company called sitting duck

131
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:57,330
that also<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're including that</font>

132
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,800
information from an<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML snippet and then</font>

133
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,260
you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> see when we're under the PDF</font>

134
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,050
that the that well that's where we get

135
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">that information from so once again this</font>

136
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the source file including all kinds</font>

137
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:12,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">of links to snippets and we're going out</font>

138
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:16,830
to ask russ but politely to build us a

139

name of the repository of demo

141
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,730
and right now in the background<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

142
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:29,490
invoking the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentax toolchain section</font>

143
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,589
and apache which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convert</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

144
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">xml files and the style sheets etc etc</font>

145
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:36,029
into a PDF file<font color="#E5E5E5"> and please note again</font>

146
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,130
that absolutely everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

147
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:40,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">done to make this happen was executed</font>

148
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the chat which also means that</font>

149
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:45,630
absolutely nobody has to install

150
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:47,430
anything locally<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm now opening the PDF</font>

151
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:50,939
file that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was just generated and as you</font>

152
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:55,469
can see this is the PDF file freshly

153
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:57,540
minted with<font color="#E5E5E5"> default data and scroll down</font>

154
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">a little bit and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can see here</font>

155
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,139
here the two targets and i just<font color="#E5E5E5"> edited</font>

156
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,839
in the source file ballast point in

157
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:06,449
stone right here at the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

158
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:12,800
see the duration of the pen tests that i

159
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:16,010
edited<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 days and rather important</font>

160
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,040
somewhere in the quote

161
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,210
here you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are is the amount of 100 euros</font>

162
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,900
that we're going to charge the customer

163
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,900
yeah

164
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:34,050
excuse me yeah you know we're a

165
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:35,700
not-for-profit but but but but keep in

166
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,199
mind that I mean yes right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now this is</font>

167
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">using our boiler plate but keep in mind</font>

168
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,610
that our boiler plate can be very easily

169
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,709
replaced with yours our company logo can

170
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,810
be very easily replaced with yours it

171
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,630
originally took us a week or two to put

172
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:50,280
quotations together now it takes us

173
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:52,560
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half hour once we actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

174
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:57,750
we've actually done the scoping with the

175
00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:02,640
customer themselves so the second demo

176
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:05,700
let's go to the gist creating been test

177
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,740
reports in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the PDF similar to the quote</font>

178
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,930
you have a basic source file i just

179
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,330
opened<font color="#E5E5E5"> welfare to the xml for a pen test</font>

180
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:15,780
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be named a report on xml</font>

181
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:17,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it will contain again all links to</font>

182
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,790
all kinds of snippets that are in the

183
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:24,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">pentax repository what the offenders</font>

184
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:27,480
report need as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will need scan</font>

185
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,100
outputs findings and non findings so

186
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,960
what we're basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing right now is</font>

187
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,450
asking all the pen testers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

188
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:37,530
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on a pen test to write up</font>

189
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:39,900
their findings using<font color="#CCCCCC"> xml the xml file</font>

190
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:42,270
for instance where<font color="#CCCCCC"> a finding as you can</font>

191
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,860
see right here it<font color="#CCCCCC"> contains of the basic</font>

192
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,620
information you would expect in a pen

193
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,260
test report title description technical

194
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,839
description mitigations etc etc yeah

195
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,730
well actually the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the structural</font>

196
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,170
foundation of it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> xml what we've</font>

197
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,500
actually also<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with another</font>

198
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,000
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> that again we are about to demo</font>

199
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">that actually you know for the pen</font>

200
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,110
testers that actually also<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even</font>

201
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,910
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bother with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> xml we've also come</font>

202
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,380
up with ways in which they can also use

203
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:11,120
get lab issues to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

204
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:14,760
automatically generate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> xml on</font>

205
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,920
so say our customer accept their quote

206
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,780
next we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up our pen test</font>

207
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,400
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that similar as asking</font>

208
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:24,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rosco to start the process but now</font>

209
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:27,120
starting up a pen test<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ross spot-start</font>

210
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:31,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">been test with the name of the project</font>

211
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:35,370
demo in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> background is now doing</font>

212
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:38,360
almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same as with a quote but with</font>

213
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:42,210
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little twist what it does right now it</font>

214
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,950
takes some files of the quote repository

215
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:45,810
for instance information about the

216
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,390
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> with also information about the</font>

217
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,760
targets etc etc and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's injecting that</font>

218
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:53,280
into the freshly minted<font color="#CCCCCC"> ventas</font>

219
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,560
repository why is that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reuse</font>

220
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,270
information the customer accepted the

221
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,130
certain quote so we're going to make

222
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information is being used</font>

223
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:04,010
independence itself and<font color="#E5E5E5"> is being</font>

224
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,010
included in the report

225
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,050
you're you're so you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a new</font>

226
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,670
rocket chat channel was automatically

227
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,229
created for the pen test now and

228
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,610
generally when we invite customers to

229
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,440
join us<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will be the channel that we</font>

230
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,910
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> also just so they don't see all the</font>

231
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">previous discussion about pricing and</font>

232
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:26,760
stuff in the quotation so although were

233
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:30,540
inexpensive yeah not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

234
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get lab web interface and as</font>

235
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:36,689
you can see it generated a new

236
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:38,360
repository for our pen test and here

237
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to use the issue tracker</font>

238
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,780
this is a basic issue tracker bug

239
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,870
tracker so to speak and that's where

240
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:50,100
most pen testers will actually add<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

241
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:52,800
findings the pen test report itself as I

242
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,290
said contains lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML files we want</font>

243
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,329
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as easy as possible for pen</font>

244
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,370
testers and technical writers to keep on

245
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,170
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing that they're best at so</font>

246
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:04,830
to stay out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to keep them in</font>

247
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:06,810
their flow say I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> fan testing on the</font>

248
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:09,450
serpent test I'm working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on balance</font>

249
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:12,479
point and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding a new</font>

250
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:14,310
vulnerability I could either write up

251
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,740
now xml file containing the

252
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,979
vulnerability or I could use the issue

253
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,980
tracker

254
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:28,650
say I discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a session cookie</font>

255
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:33,579
missed a secure flag session cookie mrs.

256
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:35,860
secure flag and here usually I would do

257
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the write up some of her pen testers</font>

258
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,940
really like to do the write up as soon

259
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,730
as possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> so as soon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as they find the</font>

260
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:45,190
vulnerability do the complete right up

261
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:47,950
other pen testers only dump their the

262
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:53,350
bare minimum how they can reproduce the

263
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:55,480
problem and issues we don't force one

264
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,860
way of working for pen testers we<font color="#CCCCCC"> led to</font>

265
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,050
each their own want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font>

266
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">all pen testers keeping their flow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

267
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,620
we ask of all pen testers that they've

268
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,050
finished their right up as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

269
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:07,270
bend test is finished<font color="#E5E5E5"> so now I'm going</font>

270
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:10,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be the lazy pen testers and I'm only</font>

271
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:13,569
going to add the commands how I found

272
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:17,290
this vulnerability say girl with some

273
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:19,860
command line flags https ballast point

274
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,860
target

275
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,890
so once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is my output how I</font>

276
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:28,310
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> this vulnerability the bare</font>

277
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:32,740
minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> said cookie</font>

278
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:35,479
and here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to assign a label</font>

279
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,200
when I asked raspa to set up the spin

280
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,460
test channel it not only created the

281
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,670
repository for us but it also added a

282
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:47,060
number of default labels two of these

283
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:50,300
are findings and non findings now by

284
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:53,209
merely attaching the label finding to my

285
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:55,520
issue I letras<font color="#E5E5E5"> bot know that this is an</font>

286
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:58,190
actual issue and it can convert<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

287
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,110
automatically for me into<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML format</font>

288
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,730
yeah it's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth mentioning also</font>

289
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,290
that and the non findings for those of

290
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,880
you who<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't use them are basically the</font>

291
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,760
things that we tried that did not work

292
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,050
and it's also default for us that we

293
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:15,950
also report those things to the customer

294
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:18,620
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to submit the issue so now all</font>

295
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,540
pen testers we work with team in

296
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,100
different time zones of course it's

297
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,279
really important to have smooth

298
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:29,029
handovers all<font color="#CCCCCC"> panthers now can see that</font>

299
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:31,339
one fan tester found this issue yeah and

300
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:34,160
another thing also is we also give

301
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:36,860
access to the gate library depository to

302
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,660
the customers as well just for<font color="#E5E5E5"> their pen</font>

303
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,450
test of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course which also means that</font>

304
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:43,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to sort of step by</font>

305
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:45,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">step sort of see exactly what we're</font>

306
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:48,950
doing at any given point in the pen test

307
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:50,210
it's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth announcing that I don't</font>

308
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,190
think we haven't turned on here but in

309
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:54,440
our real production<font color="#CCCCCC"> environments we also</font>

310
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">have get hooks also set up in the</font>

311
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,490
channel so that every time we<font color="#E5E5E5"> add an</font>

312
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,190
issue or<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we make a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> check-in in</font>

313
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:04,040
to get lab that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> announced in the</font>

314
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">channel along with a clickable link that</font>

315
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,699
people can follow that then take you to

316
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,500
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> get web repository to read what it</font>

317
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:12,870
is that we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> put in there</font>

318
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,420
so say the pen test is finished now

319
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:17,250
theoretically<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should write up the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

320
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:21,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">my findings non findings in XML format</font>

321
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:24,900
or I could ask ross politely<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ross but</font>

322
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:28,830
convert with the name of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the repo been</font>

323
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,510
demo and now in the background once

324
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,240
again it's cloning our pen test

325
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,980
repository it's checking<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the issues</font>

326
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,780
and each issue either labeled with

327
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,480
finding or non finding will be

328
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:42,270
automatically converted to xml file and

329
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,340
committed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> repository so at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

330
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:48,200
point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time the repository contains</font>

331
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:52,679
all necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a pen test report</font>

332
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:55,080
are we finished<font color="#E5E5E5"> not yet as we work with</font>

333
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,640
lots of technical writers and the pen

334
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,770
testers we want to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

335
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,470
have a certain standard say for instance

336
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,090
we want old titles using title case you

337
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:06,750
want all descriptions and in with a dot

338
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:08,730
one that pen testers used the same names

339
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:13,070
for the same vulnerabilities spell

340
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:16,200
checking that's a fancy word for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yeah</font>

341
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:18,720
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important we also want to make</font>

342
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,670
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the xml file reported xml</font>

343
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,010
contains all the links to the various

344
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:25,170
xml files that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> added to the</font>

345
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,910
repository<font color="#CCCCCC"> so now we're going to</font>

346
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:31,380
validate the report whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's ready</font>

347
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:35,430
to be built raw spot validate with the

348
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:41,550
name of through<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pastore been demo</font>

349
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:44,100
and as you can see lots of stuff I

350
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,649
didn't really put in the issue as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

351
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,179
shoot i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask ross but once</font>

352
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,610
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> to validate it but to</font>

353
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:56,720
automatically fix all the issues that it

354
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:59,979
found<font color="#CCCCCC"> roswell validates been demo</font>

355
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:03,100
although fix

356
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:05,500
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything went well it now fixed</font>

357
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:08,830
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my I don't think spelling errors</font>

358
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:10,780
with maybe a title case etc etc and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

359
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:14,949
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> ready to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build the final PDF</font>

360
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:20,230
report<font color="#E5E5E5"> the painters report Ross but</font>

361
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:22,120
build rapport then demo and in the

362
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">background again it's invoking section</font>

363
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,189
and a patchy fog to convert all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

364
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:30,309
XML files with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> style sheets with the</font>

365
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:32,620
boilerplate text stuff etc<font color="#CCCCCC"> etc into a</font>

366
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:35,110
PDF file now you can see basically that

367
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,330
had spit out a clickable link into the

368
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:39,129
chat so both us and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the customers</font>

369
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,168
all they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do if they want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

370
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,540
their pen test report in progress is

371
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:50,010
just click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that PDF link and it opens</font>

372
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:52,899
and here you are the pen test report as

373
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:55,450
you can see it includes the targets<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

374
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,280
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> only added during the quote process it</font>

375
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,830
lifted<font color="#E5E5E5"> out details from the crowd</font>

376
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:03,910
repository and edited them to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ventus</font>

377
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:07,629
repository it contains all basic meta

378
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:09,280
information but<font color="#E5E5E5"> more important is as you</font>

379
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,380
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see in the table of contents here it</font>

380
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,340
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our finding session cookie mrs.</font>

381
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:16,660
secure flag with a clickable link and

382
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,840
this is the text that are just added

383
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:22,210
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tracker so but merely</font>

384
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,689
using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen text framework we are able</font>

385
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:29,590
to quickly reproducibly automatically

386
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:32,760
create such pen test reports which is

387
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,760
pretty impressive<font color="#E5E5E5"> I may say so</font>

388
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:41,559
are we finished not yet even though

389
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,929
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not for profit we still send out</font>

390
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:46,030
invoices that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you can ask</font>

391
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:51,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">ross but as well to create a fresh</font>

392
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:54,639
invoice<font color="#CCCCCC"> ross bought invoice with the</font>

393
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:58,030
name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the repository of demo with a</font>

394
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:01,210
invoice number and here you are final

395
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:03,940
build it generated an invoice for us

396
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:08,200
based on the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was added</font>

397
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:11,020
into the quotes repository so this

398
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,520
really follows our entire workflow you

399
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,650
know from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pen test scoping and</font>

400
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,660
quotation process through to the pen

401
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:19,230
test report all the way through to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

402
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,230
final invoice

403
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:26,730
so but ok so this all is really really

404
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,919
cool the question then is what other

405
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:33,120
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things can we integrate into</font>

406
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:35,700
this workflow so again coming back to

407
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,610
the central core idea of chat ops it's

408
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,470
just that we can launch stuff from the

409
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:42,389
chat you know at a certain point we

410
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,549
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking ourself questions of like</font>

411
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:47,070
well you know what kinds of other things

412
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:48,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">can we launch from the chat and we</font>

413
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,370
started coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an interesting</font>

414
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:52,169
list some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things here are</font>

415
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,969
things we've already implemented a few

416
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:55,919
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things here are also sort of</font>

417
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,809
some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are still thinking</font>

418
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,970
about nonetheless scanning and

419
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:03,450
exploitation we've already done an

420
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:06,120
implementation of basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> nmap so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

421
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:07,529
we can launch nmap from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan and of</font>

422
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">course think about it basically you can</font>

423
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:12,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">launch this stuff and automatically have</font>

424
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:15,240
it get checked into to get lab in the

425
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:16,710
right place you know so stuff can

426
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,289
basically get plucked out and put into

427
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">the report in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right place of course</font>

428
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:22,559
we're going to continue automating this

429
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,779
also with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other different kinds</font>

430
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">of tools we envision that ultimately we</font>

431
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:30,120
should be able to use a chat ops style

432
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:34,010
of workflow also for web scanners like

433
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:37,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">w3a f tools like sequel map</font>

434
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:39,179
brute-forcing with tools like Hydra why

435
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:42,090
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean all of this stuff could very</font>

436
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:43,789
well be and again it<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes it easy</font>

437
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:46,320
because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also provides a standard</font>

438
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:48,000
environment that you know I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

439
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,210
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's worth noting it also provides</font>

440
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,470
a standard IP address but also from

441
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,029
which we're launching all of this stuff

442
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,659
which of course also makes whitelisting

443
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:59,039
with the customers considerably easier

444
00:22:56,659 --> 00:23:01,350
what other things though can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

445
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,750
launched from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chat you know how</font>

446
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:06,990
about passive reconnaissance you know

447
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:09,650
why can't we do things like who is where

448
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,980
Google queries we also had written

449
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:14,900
a passive scanning tool this is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

450
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,510
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> open sourced and in github and</font>

451
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:20,900
this essentially just takes showed on

452
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:23,990
and well scans thought I oh now census

453
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,400
and basically uses that to basically

454
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,670
query you know what can we find from

455
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,880
those sources passively for our

456
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:34,640
particular targets crypto you know why

457
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,860
can't we do hash cracking from the chat

458
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,170
you know we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up yet but</font>

459
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean at some point if we were to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

460
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:42,440
cracking cluster or set up rainbow

461
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">tables I mean what would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be more perfect</font>

462
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,430
than that you know and that anybody

463
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:49,159
everybody could access it via that

464
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:51,170
interface other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've</font>

465
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,340
already implemented things like email

466
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:58,010
and SMS integration we've also built a

467
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:59,240
spearfishing sweet that is not yet open

468
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:01,430
source but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm actually going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

469
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:05,240
giving a presentation at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Holland strikes</font>

470
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:10,100
back in October at which we are going to

471
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:12,530
be launching<font color="#E5E5E5"> that searching for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CVEs you</font>

472
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:15,350
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean basically the I think the</font>

473
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:17,510
sea cert team in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Luxembourg had no</font>

474
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:19,850
made basically a really nice rest api

475
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:21,230
for being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to search the cv database</font>

476
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,730
and we can also again these are the

477
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:25,520
hooks that we can basically hook into

478
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:28,760
and be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do all of this stuff from</font>

479
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,860
our chat so again we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font>

480
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exciting and so far you know this</font>

481
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:36,010
has actually worked really really well

482
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,010
for us in practice

483
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:43,080
another nice thing is that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

484
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,480
basing our entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> workflow</font>

485
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the chat room it actually enables</font>

486
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:51,390
us to innovate new forms of pen testing

487
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:53,790
so what we did is we came up with a new

488
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:58,670
maple basically something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called a red</font>

489
00:24:53,790 --> 00:25:03,090
blue pen test so what we did is we took

490
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:04,650
let's say we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to test a product so</font>

491
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:07,610
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do is we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take the</font>

492
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:10,559
development team so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we have</font>

493
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:12,659
software developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps people</font>

494
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,629
assistant mins and we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> divide</font>

495
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:18,270
them in half one half as a red team one

496
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:20,970
half is a blue team<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then each of the</font>

497
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:23,490
two teams essentially led by one of our

498
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:25,710
professional pen testers now what they

499
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:29,090
do is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the red team and</font>

500
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:34,980
the blue team to pen test their own

501
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:37,580
product yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool and all of it</font>

502
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:40,080
then again hooks back into our chat up

503
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,699
sweets and our you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and pentax with</font>

504
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,649
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML automation and things like</font>

505
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,380
that granted<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new hbu so we have to</font>

506
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:50,250
clean up<font color="#E5E5E5"> their reports a little bit but</font>

507
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:52,080
but nonetheless we did that already you

508
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with some customers and I can tell</font>

509
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">you that during one of the wrap-up</font>

510
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:59,459
sessions that we had with one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

511
00:25:56,669 --> 00:26:01,740
customers like literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to quote</font>

512
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:05,220
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the developers he basically said</font>

513
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:07,260
I am never going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at coding the</font>

514
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,240
same way again

515
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:11,220
and the really nice thing then about

516
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,200
being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to include the customers in</font>

517
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,090
that way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and to have them be that</font>

518
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,660
integrally involved with their own pen

519
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:20,550
tests is it really conveys the mindset

520
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know I mean we can also add added</font>

521
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:24,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bits of training like teaching</font>

522
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:27,659
them how to do source code audits I mean

523
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:29,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">for example and we also gamify it you</font>

524
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,440
know which which even further takes them

525
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,540
out of their role a software developer

526
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,090
and puts them<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the role of hacker so</font>

527
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:38,760
we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> also you know use Hugh bot</font>

528
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:41,490
and some some coffee script to create

529
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:44,010
some gamification script so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

530
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:45,690
the red team scored you know that the

531
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,430
scoreboard would be incremented for one

532
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:49,560
team<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you would get some funny</font>

533
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:51,330
like you can see for example here<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

534
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,330
job blue and you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ross spot</font>

535
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,949
says incremented blue 24 points and then

536
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:58,260
it prints out like some you know funny

537
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,060
picture you know motivational picture

538
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,730
you know to kind of make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it fun so we're</font>

539
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:05,970
turning their pen test into a game you

540
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:07,980
know and yes we did wind up taking up 12

541
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:09,420
of their developers time for a week but

542
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,850
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider this to be a training</font>

543
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,830
exercise for them right so it's it's

544
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:16,709
time well<font color="#E5E5E5"> invested but at the same time</font>

545
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:19,500
you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the course of a one-week pen</font>

546
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:24,300
test we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> wound up finding I</font>

547
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:25,800
think 40 findings just in one week and a

548
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,290
complete attack chain throughout their

549
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,750
entire system and what's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

550
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:34,230
about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the developers found it</font>

551
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:35,850
themselves you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they don't feel</font>

552
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,260
threatened because oftentimes as pen

553
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:38,370
testers you know you get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling</font>

554
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,990
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going in there and saying</font>

555
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:42,330
hey you're doing it wrong and then

556
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:44,130
they're like no or not you know or

557
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:46,679
they'll just say yeah but you know only

558
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,240
super geniuses<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know can can find you</font>

559
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,440
know these kinds of problems but the

560
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is when they find it themselves</font>

561
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,480
they can't say that anymore because now

562
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:56,310
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> the super geniuses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and</font>

563
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,930
plus it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes away the ego factor</font>

564
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,580
because they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it themselves so</font>

565
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,870
they're like oh cool we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

566
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,629
product

567
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:05,610
so in a lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

568
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:08,010
actually a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of wind and this</font>

569
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:11,699
would not even be possible if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we didn't</font>

570
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:12,900
have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this chat ops workflow we've</font>

571
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:17,880
got five more minutes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just let me</font>

572
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:20,190
finish first you know and again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

573
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,320
we're super happy and super excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

574
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:24,120
we can give all of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this back to</font>

575
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">the community I mean I really think that</font>

00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,659
we are pushing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the envelope and</font>

577
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,580
the boundaries in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that we're</font>

578
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,620
doing pen testing we think it's a really

579
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,570
awesome way of working<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we sort of</font>

580
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:36,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">hope that now that all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff is</font>

00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,559
hope that you all will be inclined to

583
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:43,350
perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> try it out for your own</font>

584
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:44,940
organizations and once<font color="#CCCCCC"> again to to get</font>

585
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">started with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bendix framework the</font>

586
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,440
only thing you need is to clone the

587
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:51,809
repository it's a github repository the

588
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,210
link is up in the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

589
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:55,649
install<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tool chain or you can also</font>

590
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,750
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> your favorite box you put up a</font>

591
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,940
vagrant box so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can easily test drive</font>

592
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:02,030
the stuff we also put up a ansible

593
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,110
playbook for those familiar of ansible

594
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:07,139
basically the only things you need our

595
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:09,178
section and apache fob and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

596
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:13,250
content that's all you need to build

597
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:13,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">those beautifully PDF reports</font>

598
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,918
great so with that we would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:30,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">here to use the microphone please so for</font>

603
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:32,669
the like developer workshop that you do

604
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:36,510
do you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cell that as a pen test</font>

605
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:38,700
or a like<font color="#E5E5E5"> training workshop both I mean</font>

606
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:40,440
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we explain the concept of a</font>

607
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,390
red blue pen test to them and they

608
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,809
actually in a way on<font color="#E5E5E5"> will see it more as</font>

609
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:47,309
a training exercise so but as a training

610
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:49,230
exercise<font color="#E5E5E5"> in which they happen to get a</font>

611
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:54,570
like a very thorough pen test out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

612
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:55,950
afterwards so that to ya so and budgets

613
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:59,760
tend to be higher for training exercises

614
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:06,260
then for pen test as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so any more</font>

615
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:06,260
questions you had a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't you</font>

616
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,790
a lot of pen testers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know like during</font>

617
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:15,670
a test will use chat as a sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> arm</font>

618
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:17,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">blow off area to talk a lot of smack</font>

619
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:19,390
about the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working on</font>

620
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:23,050
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of constrain you having</font>

621
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:25,090
the client as no same chair yeah yeah I

622
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:27,309
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously we need to be like kind</font>

623
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:30,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">of nice about what we say while we're in</font>

624
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:32,350
the channel with the customer yeah

625
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:34,000
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why we have two channels</font>

626
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:35,709
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open in seriousness we also have a</font>

627
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,030
number of sort of company channels that

628
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,160
we have as well I mean we have

629
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:41,110
everything from like Ross pen testers

630
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,610
just general Ross which is like for

631
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:45,309
company announcements<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got Ross off</font>

632
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:46,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">topic which is like our water cooler you</font>

633
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:48,370
know so we've actually got also Ross

634
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,110
tech writer so we've got a number of

635
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,909
different internal channels that we can

636
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:53,379
use for all kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> chitchat if we for</font>

637
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:56,080
some reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't feel like including</font>

638
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,730
the customer by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way one more thing I</font>

639
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,220
also should mention because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

640
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:02,020
important is the discussion of security

641
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,400
of course with this entire chat ops

642
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,580
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm surprised I didn't get a</font>

643
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,800
question about it yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

644
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:11,649
also on these various tools have

645
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,889
basically built access control so first

646
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:17,290
of all you know the first layer of

647
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:18,460
access control is of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course getting you</font>

648
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,710
know getting at the environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

649
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:23,290
first place the second layer of access

650
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:25,210
control is basically using rockets at

651
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:27,399
standard access control to control who

652
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,870
can go into which channel and then the

653
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">third layer of access control is</font>

654
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:34,479
essentially on a per raw spot command

655
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:38,530
basis which basically means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

656
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:41,200
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> only let certain people you</font>

657
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:43,270
know execute certain raw spot commands

658
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,130
so things like for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example start pen</font>

659
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,230
test or start affair until you to start

660
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,820
quotation only a small number of people

661
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:52,929
within our organization are actually

662
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:55,419
authorized to use that of course our

663
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:56,500
customers try maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and this is</font>

664
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,720
also something you have to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind</font>

665
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you are using chat ups you know we've</font>

666
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,470
also got a raw spot shell command

667
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:04,270
commands that sort of hooks into some

668
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:07,420
other stuff of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got input</font>

669
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:08,720
sanitization on it you know the from day

670
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,490
one when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we said set this</font>

671
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,880
the very first thing my hackers tried to

672
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:15,530
do was hack it of course yeah you know

673
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,720
and the second thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they did was</font>

674
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:19,490
was raw spot image<font color="#E5E5E5"> be goatee which</font>

675
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:23,840
should well at which<font color="#CCCCCC"> point that was like</font>

676
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:26,059
oh but but nonetheless you do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

677
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,980
keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I mean</font>

678
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:30,440
essentially you are giving people you

679
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:32,270
know some some amounts of control you

680
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">know into the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back end box so you have</font>

681
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:35,658
to use that appropriately and set things

682
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,620
up appropriately which is doable but

683
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:42,669
it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to think about</font>

684
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:42,668
so there was another question somewhere

685
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:49,230
in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of situations people tend to</font>

686
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,389
use email threads to discuss specific

687
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:52,950
issues was wondering you<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

688
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,990
hopper there near<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top hand</font>

689
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:57,450
navigation with some open issues and

690
00:32:54,990 --> 00:33:00,480
such but i was wondering in in a chat

691
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:03,120
based sort of unified progression

692
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:07,170
through time how to use separate issues

693
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:09,260
and is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the top and navigation part of</font>

694
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,260
it

695
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:15,830
are you now referring to the issue

696
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:17,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">tracker on gate lab no I'm talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

697
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:19,820
you know let's say we're in

698
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:21,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">such-and-such a phase and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found these</font>

699
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,730
interesting items and we're going to

700
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,500
divvy them up and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

701
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:27,200
this and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that and oh</font>

702
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,000
what did you find a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of when when</font>

703
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,950
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to track issues through</font>

704
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,930
time people tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use email threads</font>

705
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,690
and in this scenario we wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

706
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:37,280
you because we're trying to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

707
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:40,310
channel right so I was wondering what

708
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:44,810
your strategy is for managing let's say

709
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:47,659
parallel workflows sure that's easy to

710
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:49,399
answer so first of all a rocket jet does

711
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:53,000
away with email<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we think that's</font>

712
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:54,440
fantastic you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> email I</font>

713
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,720
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> look I'm also the director of the</font>

714
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,060
company and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get unholy amounts of</font>

715
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,330
email and anything that allows me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

716
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:04,700
less email is total win in my book so

717
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:06,350
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of all the question then</font>

718
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,790
how do you keep it organized well if you

719
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about it I mean we're using this</font>

720
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:12,139
issue tracker<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's again they also</font>

721
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:15,830
have labels so you have findings non

722
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:17,859
findings to do you know what was the

723
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:19,759
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> one issue in photos scans</font>

724
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,140
documentation yeah so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

725
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,730
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things so basically if</font>

726
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:24,259
people just want to discuss stuff but

727
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,240
it's not like ready for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big time yet</font>

728
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,929
you mean often times people will just

729
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:31,520
open up<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a like for a scan</font>

730
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:33,380
thread and then people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can basically</font>

731
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,940
just it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know it's an issue</font>

732
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,440
in an issue tracker so people can

733
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,960
basically just then add additional

734
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,220
comments to that issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know in</font>

735
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same way to using any ticketing</font>

736
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:45,859
system it keeps it organized and also as

737
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:48,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">Melanie mentioned we use a lot of get</font>

738
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:50,630
lab hooks so in the in the channel you

739
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,880
constantly see which pen tester is

740
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:54,919
working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what and also due</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

741
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:57,400
dynamic<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially because the customer</font>

742
00:34:54,918 --> 00:35:00,129
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> speaking of our shoulders which is</font>

743
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,530
pretty interesting so to speak

744
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,390
but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes sure that you get dynamic</font>

745
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:06,700
discussions on certain vulnerabilities

746
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,980
and most of times several pentest at

747
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,890
ones are looking at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same kind of</font>

748
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,600
stuff it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps creatively looking</font>

749
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:15,400
at the problems and what's also nice

750
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,779
actually it sometimes even the customers

751
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,450
will start adding their own comments on

752
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:21,910
the issues so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll say we</font>

753
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,379
looked at this this part of your system

754
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,460
we found this issue and then they'll say

755
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,260
well actually that's not an issue

756
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:28,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we did this is this is this to</font>

757
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,920
mitigate it so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this is sort</font>

758
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,180
of the benefit of having them there and

759
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,100
having to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the channel and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

760
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:34,390
have access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their own repository that</font>

761
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,400
sometimes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will literally get</font>

762
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:38,440
discussion threads between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer</font>

763
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,300
you know and the pen tester while the

764
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,860
pen test is still happening you know

765
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">other really nice effects of that also</font>

766
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:47,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that you know they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

767
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,310
during the pen test you know what the

768
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:50,170
problems are there so they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

769
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:51,850
already start with thinking about

770
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:53,290
mitigations of course we asked them not

771
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,180
to fix<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff until we're done so it's</font>

772
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:56,380
not to disrupt our debt pen test but it

773
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,450
doesn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on the back end they</font>

774
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:00,070
can't actually already get started so in

775
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:02,710
a way it's actually really nice because

776
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:04,540
before you know a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of weeks before</font>

777
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:06,250
you know we're required contractually to

778
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,750
deliver the pen test report they can

779
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,790
actually know from the get go get

780
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,960
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> with fixing stuff so that's</font>

781
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:13,300
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> another thing that the</font>

782
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,440
customers really like there's one more

783
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,360
thing also I think that's worth

784
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,650
mentioning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we do we didn't demo</font>

785
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,090
this because there's too much

786
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:21,130
confidential stuff in there but I'll

787
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:24,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">just tell you about it is that we also</font>

788
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:26,380
have tied our rocket at basically our

789
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,700
chat<font color="#E5E5E5"> up system also in with how we do</font>

790
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:33,310
project management so we use Kanban for

791
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:36,910
our workflow and we use an<font color="#E5E5E5"> open-source</font>

792
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:39,460
software package called can board for

793
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:42,790
basically tracking our projects now each

794
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:44,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">of our quotations and pen test reports</font>

795
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:48,490
and all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things we basically</font>

796
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:50,650
create a task for it on on a particular

797
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:54,370
can board so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a can board for</font>

798
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:56,200
quotations we have a can board for for

799
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:57,700
Penn tests we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a can board also for</font>

800
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,220
other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know recruiting</font>

801
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,419
and you know pre-sales and you know some

802
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,029
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of stuff but what's</font>

803
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:07,840
actually really nice is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font>

804
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:08,970
actually also<font color="#E5E5E5"> built hooks in between can</font>

805
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,430
board and rock

806
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:13,049
chat so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to take</font>

807
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:15,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these tasks like let's say we</font>

808
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:17,280
have a pen test that we're scoping and

809
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:20,160
it's on the quotation board and then we

810
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,950
drag it from like let's say scoping to

811
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,970
writing to review to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent you know to</font>

812
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:29,160
done you know we we can actually inject

813
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:33,450
notifications into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chatroom you know</font>

814
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:35,339
into the appropriate<font color="#E5E5E5"> chatroom that then</font>

815
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,810
can also inform everybody who is

816
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:39,300
involved with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a project that's something</font>

817
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:40,980
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed we also use the same system</font>

818
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:44,609
also for dealing with customer

819
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:46,140
correspondence so also if I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

820
00:37:44,609 --> 00:37:48,810
received a mail<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a particular</font>

821
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,970
customer we<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically can use that and</font>

822
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:52,740
we've again got chat app scripts that we

823
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:55,169
can use to basically inject a copy of

824
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,899
the correspondence in to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> lab and to</font>

825
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:59,310
provide a also to add a note on can

826
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,320
board that hey we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just received</font>

827
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:03,060
something new from the customer click

828
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,430
here for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> link to get lab where</font>

829
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,500
you can view it and then we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

830
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:09,480
inject an announcement in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chat room</font>

831
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,720
of like hey you just got some new

832
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">correspondents from like XYZ customer</font>

833
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:17,279
cool one other thing also that we've

834
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:20,010
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a similar vein is we've also</font>

835
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,800
written a script that also takes the can

836
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:24,660
board information and there's also last

837
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,940
modified information on it so we also

838
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:29,700
have for example on the quotation board

839
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:32,250
what we do is on a daily basis just<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

840
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:35,189
by cron we<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically look to see you</font>

841
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:37,710
know which tasks on the quotation board

842
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:40,050
have been idle for a week and then we

843
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:42,420
also automatically inject into the

844
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:44,670
appropriate<font color="#CCCCCC"> chat room reminders of you</font>

845
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">know such and such task has been idle</font>

846
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:48,810
for a week maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to look at</font>

847
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:50,730
this or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to ping a customer</font>

848
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:53,580
or you know and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the system</font>

849
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:55,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we use internally for you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

850
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:57,660
dropping balls you could you know in

851
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,940
periods when we're busy or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know with</font>

852
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the usual company chaos we used to have</font>

853
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">a person that did that manually but now</font>

854
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,080
this is this is all square

855
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:07,390
so yeah I have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> quick question about</font>

856
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:09,279
content in the example you gave with

857
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:10,420
session cookies right so there's you put

858
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,650
it a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little curl come in there but</font>

859
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,960
there's usually a write-up about what

860
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:16,360
the problem was remediation steps so on

861
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,550
and so forth are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about or</font>

862
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,110
have you integrated anything with once I

863
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,120
put a title and obsession cookies at

864
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:23,590
automatic<font color="#CCCCCC"> populates that stuff so it</font>

865
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,710
doesn't have to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> written</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every time</font>

866
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:28,420
good question what we're actually

867
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:30,700
currently working on open sourcing that

868
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:34,510
as well we have a huge library of

869
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:37,419
standard vulnerabilities like insecure

870
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:40,260
session cookies like incorrect<font color="#E5E5E5"> cipher</font>

871
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:42,820
settings things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we see a lot</font>

872
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:45,580
we're in the process of making it all

873
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,740
open source as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and automatically</font>

874
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:50,350
including that as soon as somebody tax

875
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:52,779
it with a standard finding so this is

876
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:55,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll we actually work on</font>

877
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:58,390
internally and will be open source paper

878
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:00,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">where in the near future yeah so future</font>

879
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:03,170
work we're working on it so any more

880
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,020
questions yes

881
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:08,550
how do you deal with engagements or

882
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:10,759
reports that don't quite fit within the

883
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,760
framework

884
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,868
I mean it soulful is wood is for banging

885
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,910
out those things a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of xsl-fo</font>

886
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:20,369
is probably with let's have to do on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

887
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:22,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">one off yep good question so what do we</font>

888
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:23,490
do with non-standard things so what we

889
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,500
showed you right now of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> was our</font>

890
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:28,049
workflow for a standard pen test but

891
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,070
what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with everything else so we</font>

892
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have a number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font>

893
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:33,480
templates on first so we so what we

894
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,460
showed you right now is our standard pen

895
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,970
test report template but we also have

896
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:40,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">for example a standard standard template</font>

897
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,299
for load testing which is sort of

898
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:45,049
related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> DDoS testing you know which</font>

899
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:47,880
people asked us to do we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

900
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:49,800
generic like document template so I mean

901
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">if something is completely non standard</font>

902
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,910
and we just need to write like a report

903
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:56,160
of some kind then we just use the

904
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,720
generic document template I mean yes

905
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not a streamlined but you know</font>

906
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">for non-standard cases you can't</font>

907
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:04,290
streamline everything so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the</font>

908
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:06,540
reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use intermediate XML files</font>

909
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:08,970
like we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the quick scope to</font>

910
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,590
the affair to xml to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PDF and we have</font>

911
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:12,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that intermediate step you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> instead</font>

912
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:14,250
of just<font color="#E5E5E5"> making it a quick scope because</font>

913
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,470
you know because<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we can insert</font>

914
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:18,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">non-standard stuff as needed in that</font>

915
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:20,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">process same thing also with the</font>

916
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,349
penetration test report you know

917
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,200
ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're getting a pen test XML</font>

918
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:27,240
which again can be modified further to

919
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,240
add any amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-standard stuff to</font>

920
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:35,299
it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can further</font>

921
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,299
generate the PDF from that so yes

922
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:44,970
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't I can't hear you um so can</font>

923
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:46,740
have you have you considered using<font color="#CCCCCC"> style</font>

924
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:50,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">sheets to convert to word files instead</font>

925
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:52,470
of just PDF uh no I haven't considered

926
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:54,060
it just because I'm not you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know when we</font>

927
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,319
when the company first started we used

928
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:58,049
open office and it was absolutely

929
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">horrible you know just because I mean</font>

930
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:02,430
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really a version control nightmare</font>

931
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:05,130
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the reason why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we migrated to</font>

932
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:06,419
xml and basically flat text is because

933
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,980
it makes it really easy for a

934
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,480
distributed team to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on</font>

935
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,910
stuff at the same time I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

936
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,680
get yes occasionally of<font color="#CCCCCC"> emerge conflict</font>

937
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:15,240
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least you can still do version</font>

938
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,730
control on it the problem with using

939
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:20,370
words like products or OpenOffice or

940
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:22,110
similar things is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that once you have</font>

941
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:23,670
them you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then if you want</font>

942
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:26,430
multiple people to collaborate on it

943
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:28,530
it's a version control nightmare so no

944
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:29,879
we haven't thought of had that primarily

945
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:34,290
because we're deliberately trying to

946
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:38,040
migrate away from that so any other

947
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:40,050
questions yes on the gamification aspect

948
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,820
of the question when you're showing the

949
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:45,480
gamification in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> red-blue scenario</font>

950
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:48,240
yeah um is that included<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

951
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:51,150
capability as well and all and from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

952
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">customer base have you had academia</font>

953
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:56,550
reach out and use this as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tool in</font>

954
00:42:53,220 --> 00:43:00,540
class room<font color="#E5E5E5"> settings for software</font>

955
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:03,000
developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah interesting question um as</font>

956
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:05,400
of right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now no we haven't had any</font>

957
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,140
contact with academia about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

958
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,360
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's open source and it's now you</font>

959
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:11,339
know under the OS better so I really

960
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">hope that academia can reach out and</font>

961
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,220
start using our platform I think it's

962
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,170
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more than what we're</font>

963
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:18,899
currently using it for and certainly

964
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:20,220
anyone else who wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using the</font>

965
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,930
environment and who can help contribute

966
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,629
back and provide some more inspiration I

967
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:28,640
think that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

968
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:31,180
it's open source indeed any other

969
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions</font>

970
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay if that's it let's have a big round</font>

971
00:43:33,859 --> 00:43:37,900
of applause for our presenters Peter

972
