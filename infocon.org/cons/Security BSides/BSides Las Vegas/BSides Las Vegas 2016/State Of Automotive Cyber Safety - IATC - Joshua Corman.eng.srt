alright so I'll turn it over to Josh

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:10,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay just to pick to close off a little</font>

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,389
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that so you're not waiting all</font>

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,629
all night saying they didn't answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

question the cyber security task force

that HHS is doing that michael mcneill

you a teaser if you're from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

healthcare world are you from the

healthcare world<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so so one of the</font>

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,980
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the table early is when</font>

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,719
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to go to electronic</font>

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,328
health records from paper records they

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,870
attached reimbursement to this clause

17
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,280
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Meaningful Use and if you're in</font>

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,038
the industry you know you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">pang of pain in your body when I said</font>

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,410
that but from a security perspective I

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,109
basically said guys uh maybe meaningful

22
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,269
use was our original sin maybe this is

23
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,559
why we're so hackable and essentially

24
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">what you did is you took devices that</font>

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,920
were never designed engineered threat

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,750
model to ever be connected to anything

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,540
and you force them to connect to

28
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,770
everything and you couldn't just go back

29
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the drawing board so we're going to</font>

30
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,210
pay down<font color="#E5E5E5"> that technical debt and</font>

31
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,400
security debt for a very long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

32
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,939
that's why we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some very</font>

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,119
uncomfortable brainstorming tomorrow

34
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:28,979
guys can I tie<font color="#CCCCCC"> it off for now ok all</font>

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so for the camera and the</font>

36
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,960
streaming I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the auto talk</font>

37
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,240
a little differently than we intended I

38
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,389
had a few automakers that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to pull up on stage much like Bo did</font>

40
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,720
given a few things are happening some of

41
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,140
them are allowed to speak in public yet

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,399
but if you're willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reveal yourself</font>

43
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,100
when I won't put you on the camera

44
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:54,420
anything but who from here<font color="#E5E5E5"> works in or</font>

45
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,789
with the automotive industry good good

46
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">good so last year we had the privilege</font>

47
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,280
of having i think it was 11 people from

48
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,350
Tesla that self identified in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room</font>

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:09,598
we had several<font color="#E5E5E5"> people from GM from Ford</font>

50
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:12,090
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Honda and we're starting across our</font>

51
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,859
tribes in a very positive way so I'm

52
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,150
going to change a little bit in part

53
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,800
because I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave some room for</font>

54
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,960
more discussion but I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font>

55
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,460
you a talk I give them so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

56
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give you 0 day you're not going</font>

57
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,590
to get new mind-blowing stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

58
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,269
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be the level this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a good</font>

59
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,040
indicator of the level of dialogue that

60
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,020
we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of the reasons I</font>

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,760
changed my mind is Mary Barra the CEO

62
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:38,310
and chairman of GM 0 10 days ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

63
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,200
Detroit she gave a keynote at a cyber

64
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,940
security conference and she is

65
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,910
essentially channeling most of these

66
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:48,540
talking points and ever and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was very</font>

67
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:51,540
pleased to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that because that shows</font>

68
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,940
how well we've infected that industry

69
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,500
that which usually was afraid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to</font>

70
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:00,000
start to like realize how vital a team

71
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,950
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll resource we are if we</font>

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,780
properly team together so I'm just going

73
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,450
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you a very brief version of what</font>

74
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,620
we kind of acclimate them to and I'm

75
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,730
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to leave a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of room for</font>

76
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,620
some of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are happening if</font>

77
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,570
I see Frank as well we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> had Frank</font>

78
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,070
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> nitsa National Highway</font>

79
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,230
Transportation Safety Administration so

80
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">the regulator in this space spoke</font>

81
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,820
earlier today if you missed that just

82
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:24,000
catch the video I'm sad to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

83
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,940
were about to<font color="#CCCCCC"> release their guidance on</font>

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,739
connected vehicle safety and it's all

85
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,000
done but there they have to wait a few

86
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,380
more weeks for government approval

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,420
because government's move slow<font color="#E5E5E5"> is he</font>

88
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,709
reminded us this morning so again I'm

89
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,179
Josh Corman i'm one of the founders

90
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,650
behind the cavalry and if you weren't

91
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">here from this morning session we turn</font>

92
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,769
three years old yesterday so if you've

93
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:43,890
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> helping give yourself a round of</font>

94
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:47,090
applause anybody come on no nobody's

95
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,140
been helping<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok all right all right so</font>

96
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's plenty of work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do there's</font>

97
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,540
plenty of room to help and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just</font>

98
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:57,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to show a little bit of that right</font>

99
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:59,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">now motivations is turned out and I</font>

100
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,380
actually had a much more detailed

101
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,880
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> this morning motivations it</font>

102
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,290
turned out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest obstacle</font>

103
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,390
for us working together<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't</font>

104
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:10,078
understand why<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody would ever hack</font>

105
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:12,029
their vehicles why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do that and</font>

106
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,190
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> making fun of them but they have</font>

107
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,410
had some bad experiences it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

108
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:19,228
it's more of an urban legend that white

109
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,359
hats go to companies they say we found a

110
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:23,580
bug and they extort them right I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

111
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,440
working I don't you saw Leonard Bailey

112
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a department justice he was on a</font>

113
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,030
panel earlier today with Jen Ellis

114
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,630
they have had almost no extortion cases

115
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,979
almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> none the ones they have had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

116
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,600
mostly been misunderstandings like

117
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,100
someone said hey I found a bug for you

118
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,200
and before<font color="#E5E5E5"> they took a pause and a</font>

119
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,870
breath they said and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay me I</font>

120
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,950
will gladly fix it for you it wasn't

121
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,870
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> extortion it was just really</font>

122
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,639
terrible communication skills but I

123
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,930
often have to speak to motivations and

124
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,330
this is where I basically point out that

125
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know just like every car companies</font>

126
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,650
not the same and not everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who works</font>

127
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,120
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your car companies the same white</font>

128
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,620
hats have very different motivations as

129
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,360
well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a table that I showed</font>

130
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,510
this morning they're all peas and this

131
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,310
is a gross oversimplification but white

132
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:09,090
hats or the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who find bugs that</font>

133
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,590
aren't criminals they do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for one or</font>

134
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,450
more of the following five reasons their

135
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,239
protectors don't want to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

136
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:17,849
a safer place there are puzzlers who do

137
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,860
it for challenge for curiosity for the

138
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,030
you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to solve hard things</font>

139
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,250
take it apart and put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it back together</font>

140
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,659
they do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for prestige because they</font>

141
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,690
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to win the white jacket or they</font>

142
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,070
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on CNN or in Wired magazine</font>

143
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,440
they do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for profit because this is a</font>

144
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,150
way to make a living or they do it for

Gandalf thank goodness we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> gand up</font>

151
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,729
bit for them and when they understand

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:50,070
that they're not all out to drop o<font color="#CCCCCC"> de on</font>

money and that some of these folks

00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:55,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially these folks are here because</font>

156
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,690
they want to make the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world a safer</font>

157
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,919
place it helps them better understand

158
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,390
I'm better structure their coordinated

159
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,380
vulnerability disclosure program so one

160
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,719
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to leave a little bit of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">time for is have a really honest</font>

162
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,960
discussion about where the safety

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">critical industries are at on their</font>

164
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,320
coordinated disclosure programs and some

165
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,909
of the guidance<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been giving them</font>

166
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,469
that you might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree with it face</font>

167
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,479
value but there's really good reasons

168
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,530
we're giving them that guidance but the

169
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,060
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody is</font>

170
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,849
motivated differently and for me I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

171
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,979
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make the world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a safer place but</font>

172
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,640
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how they're motivating</font>

173
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,409
know what they're trying to accomplish

174
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,330
it's also a good hacking trick because

175
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">the people you're going to speak with</font>

176
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,840
that these various companies if it's a

177
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:32,219
general counsel of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a car company versus</font>

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:38,220
versus the third party supply chain part

180
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:39,630
part of a security car company they have

181
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,550
different wants needs and fears and

182
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,909
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing over and</font>

183
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,140
over

184
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,850
and over and pointing a finger is

185
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,340
something they did wrong I'm not

186
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,530
excusing them but I know I try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

187
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,989
with what motivates them and then tailor

188
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:54,299
the message to that person so one of the

189
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,380
the warm-ups I do is you know the lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

and connectivity on to something and

00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,710
some case use cases it's wildly

need bluetooth on your insulin pump that

can kill you<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean j regs live just</font>

228
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,650
this area is he could do on

authenticated communication with his

231
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,080
himself a lethal dose I mean that's kind

232
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:25,380
of what Barnaby Jack was doing when he

233
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,240
did his famous hacks on stage right why

234
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,100
would you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're going to</font>

235
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,780
do it you better be willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it in</font>

236
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,039
a safe<font color="#E5E5E5"> and secure way you really gotta</font>

237
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,589
do the threat modeling you really have

238
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,699
to be held to a higher standard so I

239
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't come up with a good metaphor</font>

240
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,090
and I would still prefer a better one

241
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,789
from somebody here as your as<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all</font>

242
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,890
smart but I was fixing my deck my patio

243
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:46,199
ray I got my gas grill out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and I</font>

244
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,939
had to buy new<font color="#E5E5E5"> nails I bought galvanized</font>

245
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,960
nails do you know you know why we buy

246
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,280
galvanized nails anybody rust they don't

247
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,140
rust do you know what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is</font>

248
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,620
with galvanizing metal any

249
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:01,949
money it<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes them brittle so I bought</font>

250
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten nails because I needed 10 and I had</font>

251
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,360
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and buy more because i bet</font>

252
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,830
half of them right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd rather we look</font>

253
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,810
at software and connectivity like that

254
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,030
that when the use case is appropriate

255
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,739
when we need the rust proofing you know

256
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,390
we make that choice and when we can't

257
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">afford the brittleness we make a</font>

258
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,170
different choice but we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not there yet</font>

259
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,700
and I've often called this so i<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font>

260
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,870
guys hate the word cyber but guess what

261
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,750
when you talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the outside world you</font>

262
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:28,050
better get used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i call it cyber</font>

263
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:30,480
asbestos because we used asbestos

264
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,709
everywhere it was lightweight it was

265
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,510
fire retardant it was such a miracle

266
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:38,370
material for builders we put it in

267
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,650
schools<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hospitals and manufacturing</font>

268
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,080
facilities we put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff everywhere</font>

269
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:45,360
for years and then we found out it gave

270
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,400
you cancer and we had to condemn some of

271
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,050
those buildings and there's billions of

272
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,630
dollars of class action lawsuits over

273
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:55,650
that thing now people still use asbestos

274
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:57,660
but they use it unless prominent less

275
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,949
they don't use it everywhere they use it

276
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,140
where it makes sense and where it's safe

277
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use so I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find that happy</font>

279
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,370
things like heartbleed because it

280
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,949
affected most people and we had a logo

287
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,530
embedded systems and the stories to me

288
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">weren't so much you know that there was</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a bug in open source and it wasn't so</font>

00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:28,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">much that there was you know how long it</font>

291
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,320
had been there it's more stories like

292
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:33,480
when Rob<font color="#E5E5E5"> Graham looked at the internet</font>

293
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,060
on day one he found 600,000 systems

294
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,310
naked<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee exposed affected by hartley</font>

295
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,469
and he would do a monthly scan with

296
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">masks in and six months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

297
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,160
about half of the actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

298
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:47,939
three weeks i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it was half of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

299
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,620
got patched but he kept scanning year

300
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,560
and month after month after month and

301
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,700
the last half never got patched and when

302
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">people looked into why aren't these</font>

303
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,510
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting patched they were in</font>

304
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,880
industrial control systems they were in

305
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:02,220
embedded systems they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> in places</font>

306
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,870
that needed the software but couldn't be

307
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,930
updated they were essentially for

308
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">everyday bugs and some of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> places</font>

309
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,150
they landed

310
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,180
our mission critical life critical

311
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:14,709
safety critical systems so when you're

312
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,030
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to depend on things like open</font>

313
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,550
source which everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> does whether</font>

314
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:20,890
it's bash bug or show or whether it's

315
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:22,689
open SSL or whether it's the one that's

316
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:26,199
hitting hospitals right now which is a

317
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,760
flaw<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it's basically the foxgloves law</font>

318
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,240
but it's a serializer deserializer

319
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,890
problem that was in jboss used by tons

320
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,060
and tons and tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in this</font>

321
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,490
particular case it was in McKesson

322
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,430
device so when we depend upon these

323
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:41,620
things everywhere we've now invited

324
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,150
weakness in a way that yeah we get the

325
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,980
benefits this stuff but if we can't also

326
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:46,870
patch it we're in big big trouble and

327
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,330
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly what's been happening</font>

328
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:52,000
right we're finding openssl an HTTP

329

client and bash in medical<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices in</font>

330
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,350
our homes in industrial control systems

331
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:58,870
in fact one of the more responsive

332

very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very expensive industrial control</font>

337
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,950
systems were affected and they could

338
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,869
patch themselves many of their direct

339
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,120
competitors were also affected and could

340
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,430
not patch themselves so I still had

341
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,590
arguments with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies early on as</font>

00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,699
to well<font color="#CCCCCC"> we yeah we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use all that software</font>

343
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,530
but we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be catchable</font>

344
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,660
patchable adds an attack surface right

345
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:27,640
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shell shock</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> etc so when I</font>

350
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,810

351
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,189
damage does it do and everybody knows

352
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the haitian earthquake because it</font>

353
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,920
was on the news every single day and

354

Bono was asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for money and the</font>

00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:00,370
scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> flattened many of the buildings</font>

they crushed everybody inside now<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody</font>

heard of very few people heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a much</font>

if you know math<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's logarithmic it's a</font>

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,439
lot worse seven point oh eight point

368
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,610
eight it only killed 279 people that's

369
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,250
why we didn't hear about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

370
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,810
nowhere near his attention grabbing and

371
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,400
when all the scientists looked at all

372
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,060
the different factors like population

373
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,800
density

374
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,020
in proximity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the epicenter and all</font>

375
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,540
these are things why did<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 8.8 only</font>

376
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:31,540
kill 217 people and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven point 0</font>

377
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:33,760
killed 230,000 people and it was

<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't the presence of earthquakes and</font>

383
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,790
it wasn't the magnitude of earthquakes

384
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,290
it was do you have building codes and we

385
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,930
really don't have building codes for

386
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:55,030
building software code we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

387
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,439
honestly we probably threw up a little

388
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,780
bit our mouth when I said that right

389
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,350
because but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is we're taking</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this software that we can't defend</font>

yourself a hundred of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fortune 100</font>

our failure rate is about one hundred

given up entirely on prevention right

00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,910
now it's all now detect and respond how

quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we detect and respond but</font>

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,600
what's the response after somebody's

been killed you can't unkilled them you

404
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,770
can reissue a credit card you can do

405
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,050
credit monitoring you can ton kill

acceptable is those failures we're not

but after<font color="#CCCCCC"> last summer they had to get a</font>

431
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,500
new car they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get cheap anymore</font>

432
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,890
it's not the cheap isn't able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to secure</font>

433
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,690
themselves it's that the confidence was

434
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,710
shattered someone doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want a car</font>

435
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:38,470
that might do some

436
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,210
thing I'm unexpected in fact I see one

437
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,820
of the guys turn it's a one of the

438
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:44,500
quotes that is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little off script here</font>

439
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,960
one of the quotes that really sunk in

440
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,330
for me is we were so the cavalry was so

441
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,520
so focused on getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to have a</font>

442
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,410
culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> change and a recognition of the</font>

443
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,829
existence of talented persistent

00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:58,600
adversaries the the actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> threat models</font>

445
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,980
that what we we tried to do it in a non

446
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,930
sensational way because we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

447
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,090
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> scare my mother-in-law not</font>

448
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,109
theoretically on the weather actually my

449
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,910
mother-in-law we didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scare</font>

450
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:08,710
her because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the truth is whenever you</font>

451
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:11,020
talk about car hacking some somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

452
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:16,060
the crowd says oh that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I'm keeping</font>

453
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:20,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">my 1997 Civic and it's bothers me for</font>

454
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:24,609
two reasons one is you know a newer car

455
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:27,430
is so much safer<font color="#E5E5E5"> than 1997 chassis I</font>

456
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,710
mean so much say there's so many safety

457
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,209
and crash survival ratings improvements

458
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,680
that have happened I don't want people

459
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:35,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be afraid of new cars I want them on</font>

460
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,550
you cars right and the second thing is

461
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,199
and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why I need to do the quote</font>

462
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,069
from the administrator from its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

Safety Administration basically the last

465
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:47,979

466
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,870
was thirty<font color="#E5E5E5"> two thousand six hundred</font>

car accidents and ninety-four percent of

469
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,189
those were human error we know the year

470
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,750
over a year went up about eight percent

471
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,370
so if you do a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick math I'll do</font>

472
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,040
it for you about a hundred people

people and ninety-four percent of them

aight saying we shouldn't have modern

connected cars the challenge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

483
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:31,180
very nuanced is we need to compel the

00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:33,310
right motivation and corrective action

485
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,920
on the part of the automaker's so that

486
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:37,480
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make our cars safer to preserve</font>

487
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,630
the trust that hasn't been shattered yet

488
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,280
because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment we shatter that trust</font>

489
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,110
the moment people are afraid to trust

490
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,820
these semi autonomous vehicles or these

491
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:48,790
connected vehicles it we're just

00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">postponing the life-saving advances that</font>

we could

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:53,320
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seems a little unintuitive</font>

495
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,178
right I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to say I trust all</font>

496
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,730
technology but the truth is my

497
00:17:55,179 --> 00:18:00,340
peripheral vision is only this good but

498
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:02,830
a car can see 365 I can be distracted or

499
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,840
angry or tired but the software won't be

500
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:07,658
so we're never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> human</font>

502
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:12,279
preserve that trust so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font>

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,409
at the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the current fleet of</font>

look more like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this they won't if you</font>

can't patch your<font color="#CCCCCC"> vehicle's or if the</font>

512
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:32,740
patch is really manual and error-prone

you're gonna that's what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

514
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,909
shatter the confidence of the public so

515
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,130
I've started shifting than less away

516
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:41,889
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> cannock our behalf too are we ready</font>

517
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,659
for failure now one way we did that is

on our first birthday two years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">we did an open letter to all the car</font>

523
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,500
CEOs we essentially said paraphrasing

524
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:58,240
look you guys are masters of your domain

525
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,830
you've been making cars safer and safer

526
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,399
year-over-year for the last hundred

527
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:05,080
years we're masters of our domain and

<font color="#E5E5E5">cyber security and now their cars are</font>

computers on wheels are domains have

530
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,840
collided and we will be safer sooner if

531
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,480
we work together<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is a framework to</font>

532
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,789
work together and the basic idea was

533
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,590
since all systems fail you need to be

534
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:20,669
prepared<font color="#E5E5E5"> for failure and I'm going to</font>

535
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:23,320
walk you through<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that in a bit</font>

536
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:25,169
but basic principles like safety<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

537
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,399
design third-party collaboration

539
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,939
segmentation isolation this was not

540
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:32,860
meant to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pci checklist this is not</font>

541
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,240
an end to be prescriptive controls it

542
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,639
was not meant to be the finish line it's

543
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,169
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the starting line so you must</font>

be<font color="#E5E5E5"> this tall to ride the internet of</font>

545
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:43,960

<font color="#E5E5E5">later we're still many many years some</font>

547
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,159
satisfying all these and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the one</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the really tough urged emerging</font>

549
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:51,220

<font color="#E5E5E5">an auto I sack and Congress about is</font>

evidence capture thing nobody wants to

553
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:58,149
touch it which we're going to talk about

554
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:00,639
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> tomorrow maybe a little bit</font>

555
00:19:58,149 --> 00:20:02,739
today but let me just show you the basic

556
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:05,979
engineering principles I share them

557
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:08,290
so all systems fail yes all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

558
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,970
there are no exceptions and physical

559
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,250
engineers know this so back to speaking

560
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,660
their language this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an engineer</font>

561
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,000
electrical and physical engineering

562
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,530
discipline so when you know all systems

563
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,420
fail we know cars crash that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we</font>

564
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:21,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">put so many crash survival features into</font>

565
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,020
them so it's about can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you fail in a</font>

566
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,639
predictable and graceful way so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

567
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,800
we know about computer science very very

568
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,360
little but we know that the mo code you

569

<font color="#CCCCCC">have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mole problems you have I mean a</font>

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:34,928
to put it in here but there's a certain

572
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,460
unavoidable defect rate four thousand

573
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:37,720
lines of code we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't measure it per</font>

574
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,100
million lines of code we measure it per

575
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,900
thousand lines of code because there's

576
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,330
defects in every single thousand lines

577
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,830
of code now<font color="#E5E5E5"> really mature programs</font>

578
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,678
they'll measure it by<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10,000 lines of</font>

579
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:50,919
code but there's a flaw rate per 10,000

580
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,320
lines now Windows XP or Windows 7 had

581
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,610
about 10 million lines of code in it so

582
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,260
think of all the problems you've

583
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,000
personally experienced and the patch

584
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:00,730
frequency and cadence for your windows

585
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,950
system about 10 million but a car has

586
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:05,890
over a hundred million so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be</font>

587
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,450
patching 10 times more frequently when

588
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:12,940
was the last time your car got patch for

589
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:14,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">a security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issue anybody about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a year</font>

ago for your Chrysler right was<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a</font>

591
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:22,750
seamless patch like Windows Update yeah

592
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:24,940
I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know right and I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

593
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">what to their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> credit they updated it</font>

594
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,630
some of these some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ones we've</font>

595
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,130
told cars about they cannot be fixed and

596
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not beating on GM GM's doing a</font>

597
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:35,309
fantastic job on a number of fronts but

598
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:38,170
what no one saw after all the cut the

599
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:40,149
discussion over the patch you had to go

600
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:42,490
through is GM also patched a bug about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

601
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:45,040
month later<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it took five years to</font>

602
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:47,380
fix they did it and it was over the air

603
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,879
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it took five years to do because it</font>

604
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,910
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard problem to fix on</font>

605
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:55,090
really old legacy technology so all

606
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:57,010
right I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose the rhythm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> *</font>

607
00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:01,230
lines of code means<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 times the number</font>

608
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:03,580
of security flaws it's just a fact right

609
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,960
software isn't the problem right

610
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,669
software's been in cars are very long

611
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,890
time the problem is that we've been

612
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:12,040
giving remote access of varying lengths

613
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:14,530
and ranges over<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and more</font>

614
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,490
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> time so the original sin if the</font>

618
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:22,989
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> original sin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in cars was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

620
00:22:22,989 --> 00:22:31,959
obd2 so for emissions testing we had to

621
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:33,849
add a direct port on to can bus to allow

622
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:35,979
for diagnostics and emissions testing

623
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:37,389
etcetera from state of<font color="#E5E5E5"> California so</font>

that was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the early ones the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">very short range but they were there to</font>

630
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:50,619
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure we had high fuel economy to</font>

631
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,869
cut down environmental impact because

632
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:56,198
tires that are running<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little low have</font>

633
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:57,399
poor gas mileage but think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

634
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:59,589
things you've added you have bluetooth

00:22:57,399 --> 00:23:01,658
to your smartphone can connect and you

636
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:05,649
have near field communications and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

637
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:09,639

whether you want it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you get one</font>

640
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:15,908
and I flipped out when I first did it

<font color="#E5E5E5">and before i was even friendly with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jeff</font>

644
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:24,519
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now my kids can use this to play</font>

645
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:27,759
on their iPads but this one can't kill

646
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:29,559
the brakes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're as Ken so you know</font>

647
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:30,699
level or remote activity and look for

648
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:32,709
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you who don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yes yet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font>

649
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:34,149
to manipulate can bus and haven't gotten

650
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:36,909
the car hacking village which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is awesome</font>

651
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:38,708
by the way don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry you do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know web</font>

652
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:40,059
browsers and we've added<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party app</font>

653
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,589
stores to a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

654
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:43,449
lot of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are running on really really</font>

655
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:46,329
familiar and really really vulnerable

656
00:23:43,449 --> 00:23:47,709
web browsers so the stack is<font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming</font>

657
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:49,899
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar to us which means it's</font>

658
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:51,729
becoming more familiar to adversaries so

659
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:53,319
it's it's not the presence of software

660
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:55,779
per se it's the number and variety of

661
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:57,279
remote attack surfaces and that's why

662
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:59,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kristin Charlie were able to do this</font>

663
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:02,379
over the sprint network because you know

664
00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:04,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">dan gear has this line well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get to</font>

665
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:06,218
that in a second so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number and</font>

666
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:08,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">variety of remote attack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> services</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

667
00:24:06,219 --> 00:24:09,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">are changing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and as you guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font>

668
00:24:08,379 --> 00:24:11,259
know bluetooth is in very large range

669
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:14,139
but you can you can amplify that

670
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:17,409
significantly with a scope and whatnot

671
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:19,149
so then usually we get to the part where

672
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:20,440
someone says<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah yeah yeah of course</font>

673
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:23,139
they could kill you but there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font>

674
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,190
in it right which and I've even<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard</font>

675
00:24:23,139 --> 00:24:25,899
Chris and Charlie say there's no money

676
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,429
in it first of all that's wildly on

677
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:29,518
creative I can think of lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

678
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:32,110
monetize car hacking

679
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:35,559
bitcoins<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start your car you know just</font>

680
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:39,008
just a couple right so when they say

681
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:40,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">that no one would hurt you we're not</font>

682
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:42,490
thinking and we're conditioned most of

683
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:44,259
our careers if you've been you know in

684

00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,529
done our best practices which sucked by

the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> once the last time you did a pen</font>

look at the software complexity of the

<font color="#E5E5E5">Toyota Lexus you know braking system to</font>

713
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,559
see did a glitch lead to unintended harm

714
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:50,440
and without even trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to re-litigate</font>

715
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:52,330
that here we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have the</font>

716
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,100
boogeyman to have concerns over cyber

717
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,299
safety and vehicles it's the software

718
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,490
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the remote connectivity of that</font>

719
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:59,529
that's a big issue in fact the hospital

720
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:01,659
in Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital in

721
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:03,190
Southern California got hit by the Sam

722
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:05,500
Sam ransomware which took advantage of

723
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,990
that jboss flaw in that McKesson device

724
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,490
that could have been patched and it

725
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,590
locked up system so badly they had to

726
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,149
divert patients to other hospitals so

727
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,799
that piece of ransomware wasn't

728
00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:16,750
targeting Hollywood Presbyterian had no

729
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,918
intention of hitting a hospital it just

730
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:22,269
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> to accidentally cause harm and</font>

731
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,799
the same can be true in our automobiles

732
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:26,889
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to think a little more</font>

733
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:29,470
creatively not to script kiddies or not

734
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:31,449
to nation states who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are equally</font>

735
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:33,190
vulnerable this although<font color="#CCCCCC"> they could do</font>

736
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:35,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">sassa nations but think about other</font>

737
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,909
adversaries like<font color="#CCCCCC"> an Isis or and ISIL</font>

738
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:40,090
it's not that hard and as we make these

739
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:41,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">things more as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we lower the barrier to</font>

740
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,050
entry for these and as we make them more

741
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,600
connected

742
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:46,909
this is yet another way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scare people</font>

743
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:50,209
or to hurt people you know we wrote a

00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:52,700
piece for government agency on us on an

745

attack scenario for New York City kill

746

all the Lincoln's in the lincoln tunnel

747
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:59,629
was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> opening sentence so if you do a</font>

748
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:01,460
kill bit on the wildly vulnerable

749
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:04,600
unpassable thing and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

750
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,600
different makes and models of vehicles

751
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,260
you could disable any ingress or egress

752
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:10,910
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Manhattan by hitting a few</font>

753
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,740
bridges in a few tunnels you don't have

754
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:14,600
to hit every car you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gotta hit a</font>

755
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:16,040
sufficiently representative number of

756
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,709
them so it would take days to tow them

757
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,540
out so how'd you like to cut off food

758
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,330
and water and throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> up you know some</font>

759
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,770
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attack credit for that I'd like</font>

760
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">to combine that with a Hollywood</font>

761
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,700

762
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:30,409
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to scare people and use scare</font>

763
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,910
tactics but one thing that shocked me

764
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:34,070
this morning so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to repeat it</font>

765
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:36,020
again when Jericho and I researched

766
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,950
anonymous for two years we two and half

767
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,590
years rewrote the building a better

768
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:41,030
anonymous series we said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we were</font>

769
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,350
less concerned with what<font color="#E5E5E5"> anonymous is</font>

770
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:45,590
doing more concerned with what comes

771
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:47,179
next and I meant that someone was going

772
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:49,159
to pick up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and perfect the blueprint of</font>

773
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:50,570
the use of social media and asymmetric

774
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,450
warfare and all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things they were</font>

775
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:55,040
doing right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not even you</font>

776
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">know a theoretical anymore there were</font>

very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very few hackers and anonymous</font>

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-hanging fruit you don't have</font>

787
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,940
to be a super elite hacker to use some

788
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,169
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these freely available tools and</font>

789
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:26,090
shortly after Def Con last year he was

790
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:27,710
killed with a drone strike and I'm

791
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:29,510
shocked at how few of our friends here

792
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:32,240
in Vegas this week even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

793
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:33,950
happened but think about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

794
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">do if you wanted to hurt people and the</font>

795
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:39,680
answer is you can do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot but anyhow to</font>

796
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:41,270
quote doing here you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know on the</font>

797
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,530
internet every sociopath is your

798
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:44,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">next-door neighbors so you're kind of</font>

799
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:47,300
hoping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of 7 billion</font>

800
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:52,509
have the means motive and opportunity to

801
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:54,918
hurt you that's not good math

802
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:56,620
not only is there what one percent of

803
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,759
the global<font color="#E5E5E5"> population is associated path</font>

804
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,289
and some of them are likely be hackers

805
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:03,860
we actually know a few of them and we go

806
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:04,999
drinking with them this week so I don't

807
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,709
want to you need a situation where I

808
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:08,539
hope they wouldn't hurt me i want to

809
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:10,279
know they couldn't hurt<font color="#CCCCCC"> me so back to</font>

810
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:12,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five star</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we know failures will</font>

811
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:13,909
happen can we put some scaffolding in

812
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:16,999
place to make sure that when failures

813
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:18,590
occur we're prepared for failure so I

814
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:20,690
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> names that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we put in our</font>

815
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,309

816
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,690
had just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said it this way how do you</font>

817
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:25,039
avoid failure how do you take help

818
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,720
avoiding failure without suing the

819
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,830
helper how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you capture study and</font>

820
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,779
learn from<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure how do you have a</font>

821
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:31,460
prompt and agile response to failure and

822
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:32,840
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> contain an isolate failure so</font>

823
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put some names and faces on</font>

824
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,019
this and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is more for the</font>

825
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,039
outside audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> than for you guys and</font>

828
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:43,730
much damage can that do you know the

829
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:46,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">Chris and Charlie thing let them put</font>

832
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,830
don't let them shut off the brakes why

833
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,240
are critical systems directly connected

834
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,279
in non-critical systems right and

835
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,509
there's historical reasons why they are

836
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">and some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good reasons and</font>

837
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:59,869
some of their not good reasons so safety

838
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:02,059
by design do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a published</font>

attestation of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lifecycle</font>

840
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:05,899
you can just say we do nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

841
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:07,908
say nothing but allow the free market to

00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:09,678
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assess yours from somebody</font>

843
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:12,649
else's so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft kind of does this</font>

844
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,570
with their<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdl the rest ela and this</font>

845
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:16,309
just created a way for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to talk to</font>

846
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:18,200
them about do they do threat modeling

847
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:20,509
and for the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> six months we said</font>

848
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,710
which threat modeling system you use and

849
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:24,200
after six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months of asking that question</font>

850
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:26,960
and every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single response was what's</font>

851
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:29,090
threat modeling we stopped asking that

852
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,470
question but it became a way to not say

853
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,059
do you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> program but</font>

854
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:33,889

provide tamper evident forensically

industry why isn't any big freaking out

898
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:04,520
there's zero cars that have 10 so we

aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> tamper evident it took six months</font>

908
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:25,310
we have no evidence collection ever

910
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:29,000
this ones are fairly important one and

911
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,199
turns out that the largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> opponent in</font>

industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually wants these so we have</font>

915
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:38,840
some very strange fights to have and

916
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,520
discussions on can this be done in a

917
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,050
privacy neutral way and when we wrote

918
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,490
the standard we actually said this can

919
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:45,590
be done in a completely privacy neutral

920
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:48,260
way and the irony<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the most what's the</font>

921
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:50,800
name<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yet what's the most privacy</font>

922
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,940
conscious country on the planet anybody

923
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">Germany guess who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just announced last</font>

924
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,510
Monday<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're going to require</font>

black boxes and all their cars<font color="#E5E5E5"> Germany</font>

926
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:59,810
so if Germany you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can figure out how to</font>

927
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,790
do this and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are direct</font>

928
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:03,770
bow and I just had a call<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Embassy</font>

929
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:07,070
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to directly work to help</font>

930
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:09,080
sure it's a good one but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. is so</font>

931
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,550
afraid to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you know get in fights</font>

932
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,689
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy advocates but somehow</font>

933
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:13,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">Germany is going to find a way through</font>

934
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:17,030
so this ones are really really really

935
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:18,140
important one just like in you know the

936
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,220
hospital environment you do a more

937
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,110
morbidity and mortality you do a

938
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,000
post-mortem you do an autopsy you want

939
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:24,290
to study and learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> from what happened</font>

940
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,210
what went wrong how do we improve

941
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:27,530
ourselves and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be</font>

942
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:30,200
possible until we start capturing

943
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:32,180
evidence in a consistent way security

944
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,120
updates can your vehicle's be securely

945
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,230
updated in a prompt an agile manner

946
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,030
initially they fought us like tooth and

947
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:40,160
nail on this one they said oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going</font>

948
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:42,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to add an attack surface dad's it adds</font>

949
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,110
complexity and although we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

950
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,370
how to secure web browser we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

951
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:48,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how to do a secure update process</font>

952
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:50,870
like it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's a tractable</font>

953
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,760
problem and yes it may add an attack

954
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:54,469
surfaces it's over the air but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it also</font>

955
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">gives you the ability to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a prompt</font>

956
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,860
an agile response so you're not the

957
00:33:55,670 --> 00:34:01,340
Deepwater Horizon oil spill for weeks

958
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:03,050
and weeks and weeks so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

959
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like every single day your</font>

960
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:06,919
phone apps are updating Microsoft's

961
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,149
updating etc etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's a similar kind</font>

962
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,290
of idea you know what if they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

963
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:11,149
it the more expensive way through the

964
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:14,389
dealer physically sending USB keys

965
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:15,889
whatever fine let them but I Roth what

966
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:17,149
blew my mind is one of the companies

967
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:20,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">that screen and he said they would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

968
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:21,918
do it on a subsequent meeting I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

969
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,659
much does it cost to do a recall like a

970
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,279
physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> recall and we went through the</font>

971
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:26,419
math<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I said you know how much brand</font>

972
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,770
damage you get when you ever you have a

973
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:29,658
recall the news and they said oh yeah we

974
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:31,880
know exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to calculate it is this</font>

975
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:33,919
much this much in this much I said

976
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,409
wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a software update have less</font>

977
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,540
stigma then enough you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

978
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:40,520
routine software update and wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

979
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,830
cost a lot less on labor and shop time

980
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,020
and like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next month they announced</font>

981
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to head to remote</font>

982
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,780
over-the-air updates not because they

983
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:49,640
want made the car safer because it saved

984
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,990
a ton of money so I really don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care</font>

985
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:53,330
why they do it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just care that they do</font>

986
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:55,939
it and then segmentation isolation this

987
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:57,110
is the idea of do you do you describe

988
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:00,050
how you separate your physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

989
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:02,390
logical systems to keep accusing

990
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:03,500
physical illogical isolation measures to

991
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,759
separate critical systems from

992
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:11,540
non-critical systems some of these guys

993
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:13,130
use the equivalent of a VLAN some of

994
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">them do nothing some of them have a</font>

995
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:17,260
security gateway but it just lets

996
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:20,360
everything through some of them use

997
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:22,790
virtualization and process isolation I

998
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,110
don't really care<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they do per se</font>

999
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,250
but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font>

1000
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,150
taking steps in fact the one I've seen

1001
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:31,119
this done the best is Tesla it

1002
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:32,499
absolutely intentional different

1003
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,640
communication mechanisms for

1004
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:38,980
infotainment versus physical safety and

1005
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,660
the idea here is a submarine has floods

1006
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,579
can plug the apartments without<font color="#E5E5E5"> sinking</font>

1007
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:45,879
the whole ship the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the can</font>

1008
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:48,519
bus isn't the can bus controller area

1009
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,779
network it's the fact that once you're

1010
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:51,598
on it you pretty much have unfettered

1011
00:35:49,779 --> 00:35:53,799
access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything else pretty much</font>

1012
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,200
there's things that they do try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1013
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:58,119
prevent abuse and all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1014
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,828
defeatable if you don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that talk</font>

1015
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:01,420
to Craig Smith the guy started open

1016
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:05,710
garages or go to the carjacking village

1017
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:07,450
he'll just show you almost so one of the

1018
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:08,380
issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> there back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Civic I tell</font>

1019
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:10,089
you there are two reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hated the</font>

1020
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,019
idea of keeping your Civic now that we

1021
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:12,400
have these wonderful things like

1022
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:14,919
progressive dongles from your<font color="#CCCCCC"> insurance</font>

1026
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:26,049
you just took an unhackable 1997<font color="#E5E5E5"> Civic</font>

1027
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:27,910
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just made it hackable so because</font>

1028
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:29,920
once you're on that bus you're in big

1029
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:31,598
<font color="#CCCCCC">trouble and I just shared a long train</font>

1030
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,359
ride with the CEO of a car company in

1031
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,130
the in the trucking industry

1032
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,140
tractor-trailer trucks and his

<font color="#E5E5E5">technology works for obd and and they're</font>

1034
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:44,529
very very very concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> about those</font>

1035
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:46,180
massive amounts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> steel you know being</font>

1036
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:48,069
packable through a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that stuff</font>

1037
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,450
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they almost all depend on lots</font>

1038
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:51,759
of aftermarket<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

1039
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:53,319
technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> so even if you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1040
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:55,989
those tractor trailers are hackable

1041
00:36:53,319 --> 00:37:00,038
they've just become hackable for those

1042
00:36:55,989 --> 00:37:01,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons and when you kind of put this</font>

1043
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:04,269
into context many of us are<font color="#E5E5E5"> like but</font>

1044
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,499
josh is really really basic yes it's

1045
00:37:04,269 --> 00:37:06,399
really really basic but you have to

1046
00:37:05,499 --> 00:37:08,618
understand where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on their</font>

1047
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,819
journey they just woke up about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a year</font>

1048
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:11,349
ago and<font color="#E5E5E5"> realized they were software</font>

1049
00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:14,109
companies and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not excusing their</font>

1050
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:15,460
behavior but they have no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

1051
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:17,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing here and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think back to</font>

1052
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,329
Microsoft 17 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago sending cease and</font>

1053
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:22,450
desist letters to our buddies maybe you

1054
00:37:19,329 --> 00:37:24,130
even have one on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your wall but then you</font>

1055
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,960
had Katie missouri's you know issuing a

1056
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:28,450
six-figure cash prize through

1057
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,130
Microsoft's blue hat program and some

1058
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:32,379
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here besides have received that</font>

1059
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:34,869
six-figure cash prize so how do you go

1060
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:37,420
from cease and desist<font color="#E5E5E5"> to six-figure cash</font>

1061
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:39,069
prizes so I call that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mean time to</font>

1062
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:42,640
enlightenment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for Microsoft it was</font>

1063
00:37:39,069 --> 00:37:45,038
15 years right but how do we compress

1064
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,699
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean time enlightenment 23</font>

1065
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:51,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">too because we're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to snap our</font>

1066
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:55,509
fingers now these very old very large

1067
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:57,699
very tough market participants all of a

1068
00:37:55,509 --> 00:37:59,109
sudden wake up enlightened but what we

1069
00:37:57,699 --> 00:38:01,179
can do is be patient enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them</font>

1070
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:03,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">to crawl to walk to run to give them a</font>

1071
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:05,289
pathway there and not be a pointing

1072
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:07,779
finger but instead be a helping hand and

1073
00:38:05,289 --> 00:38:10,479
not focus on past failures but focus on

1074
00:38:07,779 --> 00:38:12,459
future success and not tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them all the</font>

1075
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:13,359
things are doing right but<font color="#CCCCCC"> all things</font>

1076
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:15,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">are doing wrong but also tell them</font>

1077
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">things are doing right and even if they</font>

1078
00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:19,209
do all these five star things are still

1079
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:21,640
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be hackable but at least I</font>

1080
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:24,160
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may be better prepared to to</font>

1081
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,859
contain<font color="#CCCCCC"> and respond</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to and notice those</font>

1082
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,959
failures and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to end before I</font>

1083
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:31,598
go to questions on a couple of the

1084
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:33,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">successes right Tesla does not have a</font>

1085
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred years of baggage and legacy to</font>

1086
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:36,969
worry about so that's in their<font color="#E5E5E5"> favor and</font>

1087
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:38,619
they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been freaking awesome</font>

1088
00:38:36,969 --> 00:38:40,869
right they have a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of security and</font>

1089
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:42,549
software engineers they hired a one they

1090
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:44,619
did threat modeling they hired security

1091
00:38:42,549 --> 00:38:46,449
people on staff and they were the

1092
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:47,380
world's first automaker to have a

1093
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,569
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

1094
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,900
program and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they need a round</font>

1095
00:38:49,569 --> 00:38:51,900
of applause

1096
00:38:57,819 --> 00:39:02,329
they also set the model of crawl walk

1097
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:05,960
run without even knowing they were doing

1098
00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:08,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">it they had money to issue bounties day</font>

1099
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,700
one but they didn't go<font color="#E5E5E5"> right for that</font>

1100
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:13,160
they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see how many bugs they</font>

1101
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,899
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what kind of uggs what</font>

1102
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:18,109
kind of variety are we gonna get flooded

1103
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,369
is this give me noise so six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

1104
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:20,598
the program they realized okay we have

1105
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:22,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">more capacity and they offered a cash</font>

1106
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:24,109
prize I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was up to a thousand</font>

1107
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:25,880
bucks and then six months later they

1108
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:27,890
upped it to 10,000 so they showed that

1109
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't have to go from zero to six</font>

1110
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:33,109
figure cash prizes from Microsoft there

1111
00:39:30,109 --> 00:39:34,940
is a way to ramp up now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1112
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:37,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">screenshot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for it but let's also give a</font>

1113
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:39,710
round of applause to GM GM this January

1114
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:41,719
was the first traditional manufacturer

1115
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:44,119
it was much harder for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to get</font>

1116
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:45,589
through their red tape and they offer a

1117
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:48,079
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

1118
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:55,700
program so let's give around with Paul

1119
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:57,469
Plaza GM and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to postpone it</font>

1120
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,029
for now but you know I was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1121
00:39:57,469 --> 00:40:01,940
voices discouraging them from offering

1122
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:04,009
cash prizes initially there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1123
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">good reasons i discouraged it and they</font>

1124
00:40:04,009 --> 00:40:10,329
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be and they have budget and they</font>

1125
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:10,328
are doing private hackathons with prizes

1126
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:15,489
but that's a different discussion and

1127
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:18,680
then third<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the last month</font>

1128
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:22,160
fiat-chrysler FCA offered through

1129
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:23,538
bugcrowd their first bug bounty they

1130
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,960
went<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight for a bug bounty so they</font>

1131
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:28,789
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a small cash prize but they also</font>

1132
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,019
are saying we will not sue<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party</font>

1133
00:40:28,789 --> 00:40:31,729
researchers acting in good faith who

1134
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:35,140
follow our policy so let's give a round

1135
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:35,140
of applause for Fiat Chrysler

1136
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,560
now if you were in the medical sessions

1137
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,150
the one of the reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was so</font>

1138
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,759
powerful to hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> Suzanne</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Schwartz from</font>

1139
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:47,230
the FDA is when we tackle the automotive

1140
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,870
first it's because there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> only about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 20</font>

1141
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:52,300
OEMs so we knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one at a time we</font>

1142
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:53,620
could wear them down and finally make it

1143
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">a tractable problem but when it comes to</font>

1144
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,410
medical<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are thousands and</font>

1145
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,319
thousands of device manufacturers so we

1146
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:02,710
had to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a more centralized approach</font>

1147
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:04,420
and more recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> nitsa has been very</font>

1148
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,770
helpful<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and the guidance that was</font>

1149
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,260
about to come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and is soon to come</font>

1150
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:10,270
out you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been very pro</font>

1151
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:12,100
coordinated vulnerability disclosure and

1152
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:14,350
I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the gateway drug</font>

1153
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,670
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> five-star is once people start</font>

1154
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:17,620
receiving bugs and they start seeing

1155
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:21,640
researchers as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> asset as a teammate</font>

1156
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:23,440
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a threat they might find more</font>

1157
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,970
bugs find them sooner get them fixed

1158
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,620
start to realize the need for more

1159
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:28,029
containment isolation start to realize

1160
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:32,770
the need for prompt and agile updates

1161
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:34,300
etc etc so<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to that five-star the</font>

1162
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:35,770
failures are going to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> but are you</font>

1163
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,910
prepared to avoid failure take help

1164
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,470
avoiding failure learn from failure

1165
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:40,750
respond to failure and isolate failure

1166
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:43,540
and the way I put this finally to them

1167
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:44,890
is the Cuyahoga River in Ohio I said

1168
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,779
this this morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's a repeat for a</font>

1169
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:48,339
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you Andrea magician who's</font>

speaking here she's a law professor when

1171
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,550
we did our Constitutional Congress for

1172
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:53,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cavalry at der beek on almost a</font>

1173
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:56,380
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> after almost three years ago so</font>

1174
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:58,270
it was after<font color="#E5E5E5"> DEFCON she kind of said hey</font>

1175
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys nothing's going to change until</font>

1176
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:02,290
people die you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need your</font>

00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,420
burning<font color="#E5E5E5"> River on fire moments if you</font>

1178
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:07,750
don't know the history the river in Ohio

1179
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:11,020
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cuyahoga River near Cleveland caught</font>

1180
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:13,780
on fire and stayed on fire many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

1181
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:15,430
and ultimately somebody got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture</font>

1182
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:18,400
for time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think was Time magazine and</font>

1183
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:20,620
it finally triggered corrective action

1184
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,340
like the Clean Water Act and things like

1185
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:25,779
the EPA but it took really<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad things</font>

1186
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,280
like how bad does pollution<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font>

1187
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:29,950
get before you have a burning<font color="#CCCCCC"> river on</font>

1188
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,020
fire how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> even put that out but</font>

1189
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:33,370
they did and this was not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> the worst</font>

1190
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:37,120
of the fires it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the one they got</font>

1191
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:38,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">on picture so we may have to have that</font>

1192
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:41,920
high consequence failure but that the

1193
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:44,200
problem is the 2019 models are already

1194
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,520
done for some of these manufacturers and

1195
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> supply chain that goes into them are</font>

1196
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,940
done even further<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so unless they</font>

1197
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:53,119
anticipated perfectly

1198
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:56,000
for help all the kind of smart security

1199
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,829
defense of things they need to do the

1200
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,390
response times are going to be very very

1201
00:42:57,829 --> 00:43:00,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">slow so I don't want to wait for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1204
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:05,599
have a crisis of confidence and

1205
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:07,089
connected vehicles<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to preserve</font>

1206
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,710
that trust so that we can more quickly

1207
00:43:07,089 --> 00:43:13,130
save the hundred people per day that

1208
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:15,079
died due to human error and if you think

1209
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:16,339
individual cars are bad just look at

1210
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:18,980
vehicle the vehicle and vehicle to

1211
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:21,109
infrastructure stuff which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a mess and</font>

1212
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,579
again nances<font color="#CCCCCC"> taken a leadership position</font>

1213
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:24,170
there and they've done a lot to have a

1214
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:26,780
privacy by design protocol it's been

1215
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:28,760
worked on for 12 years but the where

1216
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,140
this whole system breaks down is for is

1217
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,670
that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one security principle we</font>

1218
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,400
do know which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that security is not</font>

1219
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:36,890
composable which says if you take secure

1220
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,150
thing a and secure thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> B and you put</font>

1221
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:41,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">them together you might not have a</font>

1222
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:43,520
secure a B but the inverse corollary

1223
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:46,549
that is you can never take an insecure

1224
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,740
car a and any other car and have a

1225
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:50,240
secure network of cards right and if

1226
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,819
you've talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to says our Udo talks</font>

1227
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">about smart cities and hackable</font>

1228
00:43:51,819 --> 00:43:55,759
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly roadside equipment</font>

1229
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,980
that would be participating in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1230
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,819
vehicle infrastructure is passing<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font>

1231
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:03,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the clear on purpose by design so I'm</font>

1232
00:44:01,819 --> 00:44:07,069
very very worried<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the system of</font>

1233
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:08,780
car the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of cars and there have</font>

1234
00:44:07,069 --> 00:44:10,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">been some crashing alluring on this and</font>

1235
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,560
there has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> some good work but more</font>

1236
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,849
is needed and we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need more</font>

1237
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,690
help for<font color="#E5E5E5"> more people let me get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

1238
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:18,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">stage but we focus very very</font>

1239
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:20,660
deliberately on individual cars and

1240
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:22,098
intervals or car companies because the

1241
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:24,290
system will never be secure if we don't

1242
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:27,260
have secure participants within that

1243
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:29,500
system so the road ahead just a few nods

1244
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:32,720
to some new some existing and new

1245
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,910
initiatives individual bugs scare and

1246
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,290
polarize the auto industry so I know we

1247
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:38,480
like to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if we drop out there</font>

1248
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:40,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">if we do a high-profile attack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll</font>

1249
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,700
trigger corrective action but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> tends</font>

1250
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">to trigger an immune response and it</font>

1251
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,899
tends<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hurt trust if it's not done</font>

1252
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:49,880
carefully but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some people who</font>

1253
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:51,680
have had projects for a while now that

1254
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:55,099
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been building trust and building up</font>

1255
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,990
a community of interest and talent so

1256
00:44:55,099 --> 00:45:01,069
one of them is one of the most talented

1257
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:02,598
<font color="#CCCCCC">but least extroverted is craig smith who</font>

1258
00:45:01,069 --> 00:45:03,369
found it open garage is a while back

1259
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:06,430
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> east</font>

1261
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:10,569
Seattle so open garages is something you

1262
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:12,849
could start in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own town it's</font>

1263
00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:14,740
basically a platform to teach students

1264
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:16,990
and mechanics and anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to take</font>

but people thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an Intel</font>

scheme but it wasn't at all it's called

now it's a 501 c 6 nonprofit called asrb

automotive safety review board and their

audacious goal but they want to think

1288
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:14,109
past individual car protection and think

1289
00:46:12,549 --> 00:46:16,749
about which technologies are missing

<font color="#E5E5E5">that will allow us to notice failures or</font>

1295
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,309
what we did is we took a mixture of

<font color="#E5E5E5">breakers and fixers so I'm more on the</font>

like Mike mark<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rogers who was one of the</font>

about an equal mix of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that know</font>

architectures and our alternative

designs so the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this spiral here</font>

1310
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:01,420
is you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to always have a fusion of a</font>

1313
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:07,779

sunk<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost and it's really hard to fix</font>

1315
00:47:07,779 --> 00:47:11,079
the deploying fleet is of stuff that's

<font color="#E5E5E5">coming off the factory line right now</font>

00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:14,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to change the</font>

stuff and the future developing

fleet is really where we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus</font>

1321
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:23,890
so if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in academia are focused</font>

1322
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:26,828
on future technologies to make cars

safer and less hackable please look me

sharing analysis centers they too are a

1330
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:43,420
non-profit versus the

1331
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:45,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">government-sponsored version and it's</font>

1332
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:46,690
right now mostly just the automaker's

1333
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,160
but they're creating participation

1334
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:49,780
levels for the tier 1 suppliers and

1335
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,359
they're going to create a third tier

1336
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:55,390
which is patient for folks like I in the

1337
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:58,270
cavalry and civil society non nonprofit

1338

groups to help and that's less about you

1339
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:01,630
know maybe making cars less hackable and

1340
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,160
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about when cars are being attacked</font>

1341
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:05,560
threat information sharing kind of like

the FSI<font color="#E5E5E5"> sac and other ice axe currently</font>

hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the missus guidelines are done</font>

1345
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:17,109
and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through approval and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">frank can't talk about it yet but we</font>

1347
00:48:17,109 --> 00:48:21,730
believe based on previous writings

1348
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,780
they've done that it matches quite a few

1349
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:25,119
the principles of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Cavalry's</font>

1350
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:27,010
five-star already as well things like

1351
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,450
the value of coordinated vulnerabilities

1352
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:31,690
closure and working with third-party

1353
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:33,098
research communities so that's kind of

1354
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:35,079
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> update on where the things are with</font>

1355
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:37,119
cars and again everybody in this

1356
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:39,010
ecosystem is motivated differently but

1357
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,540
my goal with conversations like this is

1358
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:43,690
hopefully that you and are now more

1359
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:47,880
motivated to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get involved so that is the</font>
