1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,870
okay then we are ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start again</font>

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:08,220
and I've told flow and scholar here that

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,400
you know there's absolutely no pressure

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,750
at all in this and you know I've told

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,710
them I'm really looking forward to this

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,029
talk and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">pasteurized wordless generation and I'm</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happy to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell them once again that</font>

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,779
the author of dice where is in the

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:37,290
audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you know please welcome</font>

11
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:40,769
flow and<font color="#CCCCCC"> scholar from P Rio so welcome</font>

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">to pass phrases for humans so I'm my</font>

name is Flo florencia her<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vega I'm the</font>

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,019
that you may or may not have heard of so

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,309
my own background<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I'm a developer I'm</font>

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,890
not a security researcher so I'm

18
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,320
tackling this problem of<font color="#CCCCCC"> passphrases</font>

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a sort of developer perspective and</font>

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,109
a developer who's very interested in

21
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:08,070
user advocacy and user education my

22
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:10,740
name's got a nigga I'm product manager a

23
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:18,059
little bit some of the work we're doing

24
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:22,789
here it's just a switch where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,990
right that work now oh yeah it does well

26
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:27,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">so to give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you a little brief overview</font>

27
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,530
we're gonna the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning will be some</font>

28
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,570
basics we're gonna introduce p<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rio</font>

29
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,750
passphrases and some of the standards

30
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,000
that we arrived at move towards the

31
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,790
problem with some maybe the existing

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,130
dice where dictionaries discuss then

33
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,140
what we consider a more cultural

34
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,740
approach to how we can develop these

35
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,420
worthless and then move to the future

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,979
and some idea is that we're already

37
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,110
working on some ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are out there</font>

38
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,299
review some current research and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

39
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,369
we'd also love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear from the audience</font>

40
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,070
if there's time about their experiences

41
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,930
or ideas here for anyone who's not

42
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,369
familiar we just wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font>

43
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,020
definitions just so we're all on the

44
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,149
same page<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some pretty</font>

45
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,530
broad ones here passphrase is really

46
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,330
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a password but it's just</font>

47
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,320
usually longer and composed<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where</font>

48
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,840
they're different ways you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do this</font>

49
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:16,070
but we gave two examples on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> book on</font>

50
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,540
the board and some basic ways and

51
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,910
entropy is just a lack of predictability

52
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,160
to have more entropy is to have less

53
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,590
predictability so if you were to guess

54
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,730
one number on these dice the 20-sided

55
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:32,910
dice would be harder to guess correctly

56
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:36,230
so for some background what of what the

57
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:38,760
app is for context so we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy-to-use</font>

58
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">message and file photo sharing with an</font>

59
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,470
emphasis on teams so it's its

60
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,420
cloud-based and everything is end-to-end

61
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,090
encrypted and users need to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

62
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">log in from any device on any platform</font>

63
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:53,010
with a passphrase so we derive the users

64
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:56,550
private key from the passphrase using

65
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,079
Blake to SNS script and basically so

66
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,420
what that means is we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever get the</font>

67
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,180
private keys so if the user loses the

68
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,440
passphrase they're screwed so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass</font>

69
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,180
phrases are a very important component

70
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">of actually being able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use the</font>

71
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:12,959
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all so when we say that we</font>

72
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">want this to be easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use we want</font>

73
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,550
users to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to be allowed to not</font>

74
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,260
think very much so that should also mean

75
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,510
that the software should be very hard to

76
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,440
screw up so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example that's one of</font>

77
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,000
the reasons we're doing end-to-end

78
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,739
encryption by default so that you can't

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,380
accidentally reply to something<font color="#CCCCCC"> and send</font>

80
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,750
it in plain text there's actually no way

81
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,070
to send stuff unencrypted so there's

82
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,510
some stuff though where there is user

83
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,030
input required such as choosing a

84
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,859
passphrase and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's where things</font>

85
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,680
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> really dicey in terms of enforcing</font>

86
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,360
some sort of sane default so minimum

87
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,540
password strength is a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> question mark</font>

88
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,330
for us so so for the sake of our

89
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,650
research and our development style

90
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,820
there's a couple of assumptions that

91
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,310
we're making and we get that these are

92
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,870
controversial in some ways but but this

93
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,720
is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of what we're rolling with</font>

94
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,220
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that people cannot</font>

95
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,440
and will not remember more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a few</font>

96
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,180
passwords so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know that i</font>

97
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,040
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> several hundred passwords there's</font>

98
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,560
no way<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can memorize several hundred</font>

99
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,209
passwords we also think that password

100
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,760
managers are great for most people in

101
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,739
most use cases precisely because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you</font>

102
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,720
have a million services and you have to

103
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to taxes them and have good</font>

104
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,899
passwords for them and we also think

105
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:21,180
that critical services should have

106
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,549
strong passwords so that includes<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

107
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,169
that's say let's say me that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you</font>

108
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,030
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> password manager like one password and</font>

109
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:27,919
you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great pass phrase for that</font>

110
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,359
and maybe you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have a great pass</font>

111
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,400
phrase that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> memorized for your like</font>

112
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,539
gmail on your facebook which you might

113
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,008
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> access from someone else's</font>

114
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:38,180
computer from time to time if your phone

115
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:39,650
is dead or whatever so so based on these

116
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,949
assumptions when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're deciding on</font>

117
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,359
defaults we have a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a trade-off to</font>

118
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,430
make so there's there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are</font>

119
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,020
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some stuff that's more</font>

120
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,940
secure but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's less convenient</font>

121
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,378
and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> constantly straddle the</font>

122
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,300
line and so that's basically what we do

123
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:54,889
every single day is say okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> well this</font>

124
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,080
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more secure thing but it's</font>

125
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:58,430
also less convenient and then we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

126
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,800
to kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of extrapolate from there and</font>

127
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of imagine what kind of scenarios</font>

128
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,710
most users<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be encountering and pick</font>

129
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:05,330
some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of saying default from there</font>

130
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,310
and then also figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what kind of</font>

131
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,039
configurations we want to allow users to

132
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,580
define on their own so in terms of

133
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:14,719
modeling threats it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of a</font>

134
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,109
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a bit of an exercise in</font>

135
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:20,120
fantasy but it's also fun so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

136
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,030
point does trying to crack a password

137
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,650
become unreasonable for an attacker so

138
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,270
that that depends on who the attacker is

139
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,159
and what how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and money they</font>

140
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:31,068
have so does your does your attacker

141
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:34,729
have five dollars a thousand dollars

142
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:36,500
maybe 1 million dollars it turns out

143
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:37,729
that in certain situations you do get

144
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,229
someone who has a million dollars to

145
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:41,960
crack something so like the FBI<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

example and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at you know like</font>

147
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,650
the biggest budgets that you can

148
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:48,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">possibly find that's kind of what you're</font>

149
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,568
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's this</font>

150
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,330
wonderful paper from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joseph</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mono and</font>

151
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:57,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">Stuart Schechter that kind of takes a</font>

152
00:05:53,330 --> 00:06:00,198
look at gigantic hashing operations and

153
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,120
and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much they cost and sort of</font>

154
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:04,879
extrapolates from there that's something

155
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">like performing a 2 to the power of 80</font>

156
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,080
hashes in a year would cost around 1

157
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,330
billion for a centralized actor sort of

158
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,039
based on what you see in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin which</font>

159
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,500
isn't a centralized actor but is in fact

160
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,509
distributed and you know it not

161
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,319
optimized in various ways so that's

162
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:22,940
that's like really really high end and

163
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,560
so we decided we will take a high-end

164
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:28,490
standard and so we call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the billion</font>

165
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">dollar standard so a billion and a full</font>

166
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,630
year is probably more money in time than

167
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:34,550
like anyone is willing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend on</font>

168
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,169
cracking a password so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go up</font>

169
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,150
beyond that standard

170
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:39,889
word we start getting we start having

171
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,330
really really high entropy requirements

172
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:43,879
which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mean like really crazy</font>

173
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,310
crazy passwords or pass phrases which

174
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:49,629
really affects usability and also like

175
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,830
realistically you know we all know that

176
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:53,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know someone's out to get you that</font>

177
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,139
the cracking of password is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not where</font>

178
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:55,219
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to spend all their time</font>

179
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:58,279
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> money because there's going to be</font>

180
00:06:55,219 --> 00:07:00,229
way easier things that they can do even

181
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:05,240
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do have billions of dollars at</font>

182
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:07,310
your disposal so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arrived</font>

183
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">at this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at this entropy requirement</font>

184
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,839
which is based on the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

185
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:13,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">generate our keys we're using public key</font>

186
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,339
stretching a private key stretching

187
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:18,680
sorry with with s<font color="#CCCCCC"> crypt and so we</font>

188
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:20,659
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up needing in order to get</font>

189
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,339
81 bit passwords which are 1 billion

190
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:25,669
dollar passwords we actually need a

191
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:28,240
passphrase with a 67.5 bits of entropy

192
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:31,099
and then we stretch that with s<font color="#CCCCCC"> crypt</font>

193
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,900
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most amount of s</font>

194
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:34,699
script that we can manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on a slow</font>

195
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,258
phone's processor it doesn't take like

196
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:44,689
ages to actually sign<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your account</font>

197
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:48,080
so yeah so from there<font color="#E5E5E5"> um let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Skylar take</font>

198
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:51,259
over so I it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not mean much to</font>

199
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,419
everyone i guess but to start so our

200
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:55,159
goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to hit 67.5 bits from our users</font>

201
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:56,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the problem right is that most</font>

202
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:58,460
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are really terrible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at making</font>

203
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,039
passwords like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to iterate</font>

204
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,020
too much on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this too little stats one</font>

205
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,060
study found thirty percent of users were

206
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,639
using one of the most 10,000 common

207
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,919
passwords Ashley Madison you know you

208
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,349
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> think would be a very maybe more</font>

209
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,758
privacy minded service yet it turned out

210
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:15,469
hundreds of thousands of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

211
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,029
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords like those that you see</font>

212
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:22,129
on the board like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 123456 a data dump</font>

213
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:24,409
from gmail and 2014 revealed that the

214
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:26,449
average password strength was roughly

215
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:29,569
like twenty one point six bits you know

216
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:31,669
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is quite far off from our</font>

217
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:33,139
requirements and unfortunately it's not

218
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:35,179
just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you know Joe Schmo</font>

219
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:37,250
whatever who's writing the creating

220
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:39,529
these passwords like in that same dump

221
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,179
where passwords from you know the

222
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:43,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">company's you see on the board we have</font>

223
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,510
journalists from major news networks a

224
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,400
division chief at the Department of

225
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,890
State a paypal senior engineer

226
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,260
and you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh no surprise</font>

227
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,720
that like the github developer has a 96

228
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,840
bit password but all these other people

229
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">who you know all of us are probably</font>

230
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:03,050
trusting with our data you know may not

231
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:04,460
be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well here so you know we</font>

232
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,050
have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we</font>

233
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,910
ensure our users are meeting this

234
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,469
standard and I mean one thing would be

235
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,310
the use things like password meters this

236
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,960
is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorites the</font>

237
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,609
passive-aggressive password meter where

238
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,230
as you're entering characters it'll tell

239
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:20,180
you just how bad your password actually

240
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:23,450
is before before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we continue so we were</font>

241
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:25,280
given some little treats / booze before

242
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:28,790
starting and told that we can give them

243
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,410
out for however we please really so

244
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,579
since we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be discussing this</font>

245
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,530
does anyone know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pronounce this</font>

246
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,780
and I refuse to accept anyone who just

247
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:37,370
tells me each individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> letter so</font>

248
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:46,370
whoever pronounce this is for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets</font>

249
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:51,410
this yeah we get we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> run with that</font>

250
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:56,000
sure yeah I've that's I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> calling</font>

251
00:09:51,410 --> 00:10:00,560
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 been this whole time um we can call</font>

252
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,300
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dropbox method though so you know</font>

253
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,859
one problem with these like entropy

254
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,689
estimates is like though well the

255
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,370
traditional method is like well okay how

256
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,750
many different characters are there and

257
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,640
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> multiply that by how many</font>

258
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,870
characters<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in the password and then</font>

259
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,340
you might see numbers like this it's

260
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,350
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh cool like I can have likely</font>

261
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,510
password and I'm like almost at this

262
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,370
requirement right well you know this

263
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:22,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">dropbox method is like actually not that</font>

264
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,900
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really fly because yeah it</font>

265
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,000
accounts for some human<font color="#E5E5E5"> elements like</font>

266
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,490
people's tendency to use these common

267
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,710
keyboard patterns or people's tendency

268
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,120
to try to work around password rules and

269
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,980
the laziest ways possible like

270
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,210
apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> one out of four people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

271
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,340
basically just add one to the end of

272
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:39,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">their password yes some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

273
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,330
either really creative really lazy or

274
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,780
really egoistic and just use their name

275
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:46,310
for both username and password I know if

276
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">you all can see this because it's kind</font>

277
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">of small but here's like a breakdown of</font>

278
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,880
what six been dropbox method looks like

279
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,740
we're you know we for fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> we entered a</font>

280
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,140
password that would pass most standards

281
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,620
it is baseball one two three written in

282
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,170
lead so with mix k

283
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,520
numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and selection you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can see that</font>

284
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,290
it actually detects like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh you know</font>

285
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,939
what use the word baseball which happens

286
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">to for some reason in America be the</font>

287
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,440
ninth most common word appearing in

288
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:12,990
passwords it recognized the letter

289
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,370
substitutions and these common sequences

290
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,870
so although this would pass many

291
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:20,610
standards it turns out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be something</font>

292
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:21,840
that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be cracked instantly so our</font>

293
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,880
first solution was kind of like a

294
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,530
classic lazy developer solution which

295
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,689
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like okay so there's this tool that</font>

296
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,490
we didn't just import and we'll just we

297
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,170
we realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe this is not quite</font>

298
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:34,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">good enough like the estimates that it's</font>

299
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:36,240
giving or maybe a little off so okay

300
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,250
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just require 100 bit pass phrases</font>

301
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,660
and then we'll like write all this intro

302
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,210
text about how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose a good pass</font>

303
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,699
phrase and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll give a strength meter</font>

304
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:46,440
and that's totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great solution and</font>

305
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,320
users will totally do the right thing

306
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:53,070
and it'll be great and then of course it

307
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:55,080
wasn't so basically the feedback that we

308
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:58,650
started getting was like people hated it

309
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:01,590
and liked it we just got so many support

310
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:03,300
requests of people complaining<font color="#CCCCCC"> that like</font>

311
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,410
they were entering 50 character along

312
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,000
passwords and they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

313
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,250
writing whole novels into the password

314
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,780
passphrase field and and they were still

315
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,790
not hitting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entropy requirements and</font>

316
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:14,040
it was and we were seeing also a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

317
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">lost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pass phrases and people emailing</font>

318
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,439
support being like I'm locked out of my

319
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,680
account and that's being like you know

320
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can't help you sorry so that's pretty</font>

321
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,180
bad and I mean what we found is that

322
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,070
people are basically mad at bad at

323
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,349
making pass phrases for many of the same

324
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,700
reasons as passwords I mean when one

325
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,220
side they're just not used to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

326
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,450
these rules like we're confusing and had

327
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,890
some overhead but the other thing is

328
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:37,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're still predictable like when</font>

329
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,520
we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> request that verbatim said well</font>

330
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,200
I've entered 50 characters and I'm not

331
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,480
passing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and we're like well I mean</font>

332
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,590
we have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool and it's like yeah if</font>

333
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,990
you enter a password password password

334
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:48,870
password you know it might be 50

335
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:50,730
characters but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not going to fly the</font>

336
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">other problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we had is that you know</font>

337
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,090
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people succeeded and then we were</font>

338
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,199
talking to our users to get some

339
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,330
feedback and one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

340
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,680
constantly came up was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

341
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">just use like this like this quote from</font>

342
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">like my favorite book or my favorite</font>

343
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,560
band which also happens to be listed as

344
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,390
one of my likes on<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook or tumblr or</font>

345
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,359
whatever other platform that's really

346
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:11,340
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for people to find in these cases</font>

347
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,329
you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these Drake and Bon</font>

348
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:17,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jovi quotes</font>

349
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:18,719
we passed this 100 bit standard another

350
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:20,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem is that language is pretty</font>

351
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,379
predictable like you know we like to

352
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:25,439
think we are able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create random</font>

353
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:27,269
statements or sentences but as a hat<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

354
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:29,099
know as is the case language follows

355
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:31,980
patterns and machines are really good at

356
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,139
identifying this this is a some data

357
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,939
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> googles and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Graham charts and</font>

358
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,160
basically what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it saying is that if</font>

359
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:39,988
you enter the word you what words are

360
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,279
most likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> v's it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

361
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:43,139
to be every word in the english

362
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,029
dictionary it's going to be you can you

363
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,829
are and it can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to multiple</font>

364
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:49,139
levels like you cannot you can get you

365
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:50,878
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how this really</font>

366
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:55,110
quickly narrows down the you know

367
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:57,809
possible options that a machine needs to

368
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,910
run through know their issues that when

369
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:02,549
you let users pick their own throne

370
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:05,488
password their memory is fallible like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

371
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:07,410
would say close to half if not more of

372
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:09,029
our forgotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> past for his support</font>

373
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,769
tickets were resolved by did you

374
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:12,929
capitalize the first letter did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you add</font>

375
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:16,919
a period at the end and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that resolved</font>

376
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:19,889
many many many many the other fun part

377
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:22,410
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this user you know user chosen one</font>

378
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:24,149
uh system with meters was how meters

379
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,189
themselves work and in this case it's

380
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:28,139
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool you did it like okay cool this</font>

381
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:31,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my super sweet password i'm going to</font>

382
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:33,239
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this last letter and uh too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

383
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,610
like password doesn't isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciated</font>

384
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:37,439
by six bin or dropbox so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like</font>

385
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,879
really frustrating experience to be

386
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:42,209
typing and being like yeah and then

387
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">never mind so you know we're still sort</font>

388
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:46,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">of at the same question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of like how how</font>

389
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:48,540
can we actually ensure that you know

390
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:50,160
users meet this standard in this case

391
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,319
passive-aggressive password meter had

392
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,699
some great advice you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

393
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:55,498
just mash your head<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the keyboard it</font>

394
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:57,329
would be more secure which could also

395
00:14:55,499 --> 00:15:00,269
mean maybe if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just had a way to</font>

396
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:02,579
randomly generate content then you know

397
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:04,019
users wouldn't have to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

398
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:05,758
passwords they create and we could get

399
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:07,739
reliable standards for estimating

400
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,869
password entropy the best part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all</font>

401
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:11,669
this is is that academics have actually

402
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:13,139
studied this already and found that it

403
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:15,179
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if users pick their own</font>

404
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:16,739
passwords or they're given to them they

405
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:19,470
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just as likely to remember or forget</font>

406
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:21,539
them either way<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's like well okay</font>

407
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:25,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">if it doesn't make a difference what why</font>

408
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:27,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">not let it be random um</font>

409
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:30,210
so then we get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess some of the</font>

410
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,470
problems with<font color="#E5E5E5"> passphrases I assume most</font>

411
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,090
people in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this talk are familiar with</font>

412
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,520
this comic in this comic is you know

413
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,380
five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> old now and this is what</font>

414
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,090
basically got me interested in

415
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">passphrases in the first place I didn't</font>

416
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,900
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they were like a year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and a</font>

417
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,050
half<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I saw this and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was like</font>

418
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:48,090
oh was awesome this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really easy</font>

419
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:50,040
solution to<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid things like this that</font>

420
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,570
I get asked all the time this is a

421
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,400
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad list this is a real</font>

422
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:55,080
list of password requirements if you

423
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,910
can't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it says you need exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

424
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,800
characters you need at least one letter

425
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,420
one number in one special character but

426
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,180
those special characters can only be at

427
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,860
hashtag or dollar sign on it can't be in

428
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,329
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first or last it has to be like a</font>

429
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,370
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> one than you use over the past</font>

430
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:10,950
five times it's huge and terrible it

431
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:16,410
requires a simile a metaphor and the

432

name of one of your children um and I

433
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:22,589
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it could be no it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

434
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,290
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could be that pass vs are also</font>

435
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:27,780
a fair bit longer right like on the left

436
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:29,099
is a randomly generated password and on

437
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,900
the right as a passphrase<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font>

438
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,330
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the passphrase has almost twice as</font>

439
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,280
many characters on the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

440
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:37,200
passphrase only has five chunks of data

441
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,939
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remember with the 13</font>

442
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,980
character password I'd remember 13

443
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:45,290
characters the passphrase I remember

444
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:48,540
five words another issue is that

445
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:50,520
passwords need to be localized you can't

446
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,900
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> give an English passphrase to a</font>

447
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,000
French speaker and expect them to

448
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,470
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> these five English words on</font>

449
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,850
that means you also need different

450
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,160
dictionaries for every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> language</font>

451
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,560
and it also means each language presents

452
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,089
its own problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example German</font>

453
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">whose knock is probably going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

454
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:10,620
longer pass phrases than French or

455
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:12,390
English also against passphrases there's

456
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,159
some evidence that pass phrases aren't

457
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:16,190
more usable than passwords one study

458
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,270
found that five character passwords were

459
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,920
significantly easier to remember and

460
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,859
faster to type than equivalent strength

461
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:25,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">32 forward pass phrases after after</font>

462
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:27,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">using them for a few days however the</font>

463
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,040
same study found that six character

464
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,900
passwords were significantly harder more

465
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,600
annoying and less fun to learn than the

466
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,220
five character passwords that you know

467
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,959
good for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us using larger dictionaries</font>

468
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,659
for passphrases didn't seem to affect

469
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,309
ability at all and that importantly and

470
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:42,929
a word you rarely hear with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pat with</font>

471
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:47,190
passwords and fast phrases that people

472
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:48,600
found passphrase is more fun to learn on

473

the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when we started looking</font>

474
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,620
at what happens when you use stronger

475
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,539
requirements for password passwords and

476
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,580
pass<font color="#CCCCCC"> vs turns</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out that a six-word</font>

477
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:59,158
passphrase is significantly more<font color="#CCCCCC"> likely</font>

478
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:01,649
to be memorized faster and more reliably

479
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:06,450
than a 12 character password when using

480
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:09,149
a service over a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

481
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:10,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">what makes it what are the could it be</font>

482
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:13,739
that the problem with passphrases is

483
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,840
actually just the words so our question

484
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,399
was what actually makes a good pass

485
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,840
phrase dictionary and and that's

486
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:21,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that we hadn't seen a lot of</font>

487
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:24,209
research on so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we looked at was</font>

488
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:26,549
you know the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> famous word list is</font>

489
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:30,210
the dice where list and so the idea

490
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:33,120
there was almost a thousand words short

491
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:35,940
words and they're supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be common</font>

492
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:40,590
but arguably words like Saudi wuhan and

493
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:43,500
NCAA and Boise as in Boise Idaho<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

494
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:45,720
are not actually particularly common and

495
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,549
also are very culturally-specific and

496
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">also there's a bunch of of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know like</font>

497
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:52,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of gibberish that is included in</font>

498
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:54,750
there so and<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that</font>

499
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:58,010
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us was just not didn't quite go with</font>

500
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,820
our philosophy was the suggestion that

501
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know if you don't know a word</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

502
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,879
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> look it up and for us you know we</font>

503
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,529
want to reduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> friction as much as</font>

504
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,870
possible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user so we don't want</font>

505
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:08,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to like you know need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to</font>

506
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,020
some external site to look something up

507
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:11,908
in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to find it memorable</font>

508
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,029
so so that's something that didn't work

509
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:16,950
for us so a different example is secure

510
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:19,440
drop which uses a sort of trim down

511
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:22,620
version of the dice where list and it

512
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,200
removed a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff from it like</font>

513
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,270
Americanisms and symbols and gibberish

514
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,240
but it still has some pretty difficult

515
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:33,899
words there's also the PGP word list

516
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,600
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very short and it also has very</font>

517
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:38,789
long and kind of hard to spell words

518
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,178
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually meant for being spoken so</font>

519
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:44,370
that that factors in there there's also

520
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:46,169
a superior was originally based on on

521
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,989
mini lock and mini lock came with a list

522
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:50,370
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> words which was extremely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

523
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,480
we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

524
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:54,389
were the source what the source<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

525
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,630
that is but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it includes some pretty long</font>

526
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:59,370
and obscure words for example does

527
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,320
anyone can we have some more booze for

528
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:03,290
anyone who can spell the word psoriasis

529
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:14,580
without looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your phone right now</font>

530
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:17,430
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could think yes yes we're</font>

531
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:40,139
actually here whip<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

532
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:43,830
chilly side pie excellent i will

533
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:47,070
congratulations we are all of its yes we

534
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:50,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all a bit smarter today so we also</font>

535
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:54,050
have up to them<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the minute up to</font>

536
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:58,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the minute which is a thumb</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and a minut</font>

537
00:20:54,050 --> 00:21:01,830
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun we also have there's also</font>

538
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:03,929
this study correct horse battery staple

539
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:07,199
which uses another word list which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

540
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:10,080
from the contempt corpus of contemporary

541
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">american english and that's a much</font>

542
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,820
shorter word but it as a much shorter

543
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,370
list but it does use really<font color="#E5E5E5"> long words</font>

544
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,770
and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually find that character</font>

545
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,989
length was a character length in a

546
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:24,210
general passphrase or password was

547
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,740
actually a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> factor in usability so</font>

548
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:27,900
the study found that five character

549
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:32,340
passwords were more memorable than three

550
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:34,590
to four forward pass phrases but length

551
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,939
seems to have featured in that so that's

552
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that's something that we took note of</font>

553
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,770
there's also this other study that we

554
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:43,050
love towards reliable storage of 56 bit

555
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:45,150
secrets and human memory which uses a

556
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:47,940
much shorter list as well and it

557
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually does do a lot of trimming so</font>

558
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,140
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> chosen from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Google's n-gram corpus</font>

559
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,600
and it eliminates words that are close

560
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:58,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">to each other so hard to easy to confuse</font>

561
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,360
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also removes prefixes so so the</font>

562
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,340
autocomplete can work better and

563
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,810
excludes vulgar words plural wards and

564
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,230
slang so it's got a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of the</font>

565
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,730
sort of

566
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:09,000
cultural element of trying to figure out

567
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:11,490
what are good words for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human so</font>

568
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,570
that's that's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> great but one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

569
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:15,330
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we had a lot of</font>

570
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:17,639
questions about is what words are people

571
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:20,040
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely to know and if they know</font>

572
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,600
them then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we might extrapolate from</font>

573
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,159
there that those are the words that

574
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,570
people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely to remember and</font>

575
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,299
another question<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we ask is what</font>

576
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,678
words are easy to type the other

577
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:30,900
question for us given our entropy

578
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:33,179
requirements is how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> words do we</font>

579
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:36,169
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use so these lists have a huge</font>

580
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:39,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">range I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 and something to</font>

581
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:41,100
56,000 so and a larger list means of

582
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,890
course that we get more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an entropy</font>

583
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,230
forward but it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> means more</font>

584
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,429
characters per word on average and it

585
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:51,179
also means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we get weirder words</font>

586
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:53,760
like epicycle oi and whatnot so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

587
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:56,010
that the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in all of these and</font>

588
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,410
all of these lists is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

589
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,760
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a UX problem and so a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

590
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">these lists have been designed by</font>

591
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,720
developers and security professionals

592
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:07,860
and they haven't been formulated from a

593
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,419
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more usability kind of side and</font>

594
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,939
so we that that's a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

595
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:14,280
found really interesting and that is how

596
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,679
we got to a cultural approach to pass

597
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,970
phrases which we're also dubbing how

598
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:20,880
Seinfeld in Game of Thrones makes

599
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:22,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">passphrases better so like a quick</font>

600
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,480
review some of the technical approaches

601
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,280
is like well use shorter words use words

602
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,200
based on patterns use phonetically

603
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,418
distinct words or semantically distinct

604
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,280
words make it friendly for auto complete

605
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:33,840
and auto correct but some of the

606
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,490
questions we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is like</font>

607
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,530
well what words do people know what

608
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:40,380
words do they know how to spell what

609
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:41,490
languages do people speak what a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jew k</font>

610
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">shin level can we expect from people</font>

611
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">what words might offend people and like</font>

612
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,860
one simple thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like well what do</font>

613
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:48,809
users actually think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this like are</font>

614
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:52,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">these words working for them or not you</font>

615
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:53,129
know talk talk to your end user so you

616
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:54,750
know on the first question it's like

617
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:56,220
well what words do we pick and we could

618
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:59,640
pick the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> common words that appear</font>

619
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,740
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> corpuses like from coca at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Google</font>

620
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,210
n-grams<font color="#E5E5E5"> wiktionary and these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are cool</font>

621
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:06,030
breeze they help<font color="#E5E5E5"> us identify the most</font>

622
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,929
frequently used words in English but

623
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,820
we're wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> if like we should</font>

624
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:11,010
include all these words you know like

625
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,960
these were these lists include for

626
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,970
example the Harvard Law Review which has

627
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,049
a flight grade reading level index

628
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,460
saying that you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been in</font>

629
00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:20,700
school for about

630
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:23,580
33 years to understand most of the

631
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:27,240
content in there in contrast dr.<font color="#E5E5E5"> Seuss</font>

632
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:29,428
has a great index of one I you can have

633
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:34,409
almost no education and be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to read</font>

634
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:35,760
ah some some dr. Seuss books so

635
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:37,559
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we think is that well</font>

636
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,240
what if we sourced the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most commonly</font>

637
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:41,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">used words from the most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accessible</font>

638
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,110
sources because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know a language has</font>

639
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:45,059
some social biases of like who gets

640
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:47,219
published and where and in which mediums

641
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:48,539
and the mediums themselves have

642
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,130
different words like the most common

643
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:52,080
words appearing in printed media is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

644
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:55,529
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as what appears</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> online is not</font>

645
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,059
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as television and film and so</font>

646
00:24:55,529 --> 00:25:00,090
you know when trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to source words to</font>

647
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:02,730
protect the kingdom you know we are we

648
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:04,439
used popular film and television for

649
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:07,980
most languages corpuses from

650
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,539
opensubtitles.org we did this on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

651
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,179
side<font color="#E5E5E5"> of is you know popular video is</font>

652
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:15,090
accessible and well-known tends to get

653
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:16,289
translated on its own anyway or also you

654
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,639
know if you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

655
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:19,140
languages there's also a local media

656
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,169
that gets closed captioned and all of

657
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,610
that also ends up on opensubtitles.org

658
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:25,559
yeah opensubtitles.org actually as a

659
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:27,570
source is fantastic because in many

660
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:30,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases it's also local translators</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

661
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:33,149
and so people from the from that

662
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:35,760
language will actually be the ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

663
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:38,760
know recreating their phrases in a more

664
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,590
culturally relevant way but importantly

665
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:43,440
subtitles were actually studied and

666
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:45,449
found to have a a you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the word</font>

667
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,890
frequency data from subtitles is more

668
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,659
accurate this is a more<font color="#E5E5E5"> accurate</font>

669
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,390
indicator of reading performance in a

670
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:54,210
culture and word recognition that when

671
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:57,779
the studying French American English

672
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:59,940
speaking Dutch Chinese and Greek youth

673
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:03,169
they actually found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way kids</font>

674
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:05,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">were learning was most accurately</font>

675
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:07,649
measured by the words then he went

676
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:12,750
subtitles not by corpuses from written

677
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:14,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">text so we you know take that as our</font>

678
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,169
source we still have the question of

679
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:18,710
like well how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> words you know like</font>

680
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:22,820
do we keep it small do we keep it huge

681
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:24,809
do we take you know the common wisdom or

682
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,879
you know do we just ask the question

683
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:31,440
well how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many words someone actually</font>

684
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:33,509
likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know for this we use a</font>

685
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,309
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> website called test your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vocab com</font>

686
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:36,870
it's basically been a<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term research</font>

687
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:39,240
project I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's been on for like</font>

688
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten years where they just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

689
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,750
take this quiz<font color="#E5E5E5"> online and it will</font>

690
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,460
measure their vocab and we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font>

691
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">and take one of the lower percentiles</font>

692
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,820
because we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be as accessible as</font>

693
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:49,740
possible which for an<font color="#CCCCCC"> eighteen-year-old</font>

694
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you know high school graduate</font>

695
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,240
possibly in the lower 20th percentile it

696
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,720
was measured<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they would know about</font>

697
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,580
fifteen thousand eight hundred words so

698
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">using so we distill starter but this is</font>

699
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:04,019
our guide so our process was basically

700
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:05,789
find a large corpus of subtitles for the

701
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:07,620
language<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're working on compare that</font>

702
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:09,629
against<font color="#CCCCCC"> the native language dictionary</font>

703
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:11,719
to try and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of slang sound cues</font>

704
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:13,709
or potential typos from the subtitles

705
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,799
organizing the remaining list by word

706
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:18,470
frequency isolate the twenty to thirty

707
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,210
five thousand most common words

708
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:23,159
depending on the language and how large

709
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,899
the corpus was remove offensive words

710
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,419
from the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then start trimming a</font>

711
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:29,459
jump down by removing the longest words

712
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:32,100
until the list is about twelve thousand

713
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:34,980
words long and the result is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

714
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,570
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> twelve thousand word lists of the</font>

00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,639
shortest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and most common</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> words in a</font>

716
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:40,139
language with the cultural basis for

717
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:43,320
assuming that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually know what</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">these words are it also means we end up</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">with a larger dictionary with more</font>

720
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,049
entropy forward you can see that

721
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">compared do want to say a word list with</font>

722
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:52,019
only a thousand words you would need

723
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:55,039
five words instead of seven words in

724
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:57,419
your passphrase for a similar strength

725
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:59,129
it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> tends to mean that when you have</font>

726
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:02,159
less words and they might be a little

727
00:27:59,129 --> 00:28:03,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer that it may not actually result</font>

728
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,399
in that much longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a passphrase than</font>

729
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,049
just having more shorter words which has

730
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:10,370
been some of the conventional wisdom for

731
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:13,830
now so we threw this up here this is um

732
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:16,979
from it one of the newest eff short word

733
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:18,629
lists coming up that has an average<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

734
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,970
four point five characters per word and

735
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:24,120
requires about<font color="#E5E5E5"> six words</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have similar</font>

736
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:25,590
strength to a five-word<font color="#CCCCCC"> pirie opus</font>

737
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,008
<font color="#CCCCCC">praise and they're on average they're</font>

738
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:30,059
very similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> in length just so you guys</font>

739
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:32,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get an idea of what this looks like</font>

740
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:35,549
we thought it'd be fun to generate the

741
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:37,799
first like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few dice where and pieria</font>

742
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:39,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">passphrases to see what they might look</font>

743
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:43,450
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in general the dice where ones</font>

744
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:45,250
do are shorter but we find

745
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:47,950
the period<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to be a little more</font>

746
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,149
accessible relatable<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm personally a</font>

747
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:51,399
big fan of the first one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came up</font>

748
00:28:49,149 --> 00:28:54,789
the reindeer ruling insanity rejoin

749
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:57,939
reality um I recognize most these words

750
00:28:54,789 --> 00:29:00,399
compared to things like you know 52 eww

751
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:03,940
Hera n-c-double-a did make an appearance

752
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:08,260
here for any basketball fans and Idaho

753
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:14,230
not Boise though um yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is just</font>

754
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:15,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">our a visual comparison so we haven't so</font>

755
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll talk a little bit about what's</font>

756
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:20,260
coming in the future in a bit but we had

757
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,059
a chance to get our word list into a

758
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,158
study done but at the University of Bonn

759
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:26,789
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's been published yet it</font>

760
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,549
should be out<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty soon so it's a</font>

761
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:32,049
researcher called sergei<font color="#E5E5E5"> Duchamp and</font>

762
00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:34,230
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of his call it colleagues they were</font>

763
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:37,690
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a study on public key</font>

764
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:39,970
comparison and recognition and so they

765
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:43,000
threw<font color="#E5E5E5"> a word list and in addition to</font>

766
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:45,460
hexadecimal base32 purely numeric and

767
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">the PGP word list so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit it's</font>

768
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,590
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not quite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're doing i mean</font>

769
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:53,350
it's it's a public key test not i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

770
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:54,610
a memorization test for pass prices but

771
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:58,899
it's still fairly interesting because

772
00:29:54,610 --> 00:30:00,580
what we saw from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> study is that it</font>

773
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:02,289
was the fastest verification method

774
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,418
among the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones that they tried it</font>

775
00:30:02,289 --> 00:30:06,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">was second best in terms of error</font>

776
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:08,679
detection so the best in terms of error

777
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:12,070
detection was generated sentence like

778
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:13,330
structures the second best it was also

779
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second best and avoiding false</font>

780
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:18,720
positives interestingly<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best and</font>

781
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:21,519
avoiding false positive was numeric and

782
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,230
users definitely preferred it over non

783
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,659
language options so that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

784
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,070
pretty good mix given that it performs

785
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:30,130
second two different things in different

786
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:32,260
categories so of course that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

787
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:35,799
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> as seeing how memorize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> abul it is</font>

788
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:37,299
but hopefully that's coming up but but

789
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:39,279
still this it was pretty pretty cool

790
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:41,620
opportunity to get our to get our work

791
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,760
into some some academic papers and we

792
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:46,268
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forward to doing more of</font>

793
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,620
that so from what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have right now we</font>

794
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:49,210
do know that there are some pain points

795
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,889
and so there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some things</font>

796
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:53,139
that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a closer look at</font>

797
00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:55,179
and we'd love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> participants</font>

798
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:57,040
about so one of

799
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:59,020
things that we will ask ourselves is you

800
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,030
know do subtitles from friends and

801
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,730
Grey's Anatomy belong in you know

802
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:05,950
various other dictionaries we do

803
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:09,640
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> counterbalance because we</font>

804
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:11,530
check the words Jenner the<font color="#E5E5E5"> generated by</font>

805
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,110
the subtitles against the dictionary in

806
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">the language that were that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're using</font>

807
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:17,020
but they're still you can really see the

808
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:20,920
influence<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like British colonization</font>

809
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:22,450
and American culture yes being Norwegian

810
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,120
I can tell you right now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phrase</font>

811
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:26,740
how you do it is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I only</font>

812
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,520
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know where you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> friends</font>

813
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:38,110
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are using that phrase region nobody</font>

814
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:40,030
would have a good to know so so yes so

815
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,949
there's some tricky things there though

816
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,840
like you know like so something might be

817
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:46,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">more recognizable in one language and</font>

818
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,179
not translate very well so there's some

819
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:51,129
trickiness around there we do see that a

820
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,130
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of names even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> English names end up</font>

821
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:56,140
in the corpuses of every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single language</font>

822
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:58,060
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's you know that's a bit of</font>

823
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,320
a question mark for us so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

824
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,720
ask ourselves if we should strip those

825
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,370
names out and should be stripped proper

826
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,260
nouns because they're not a good point

827
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:07,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">of reference for for a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people but</font>

828
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,100
then only on the other hand I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

829
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:11,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a particularly cool passphrase</font>

830
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,149
Elizabeth ground and human glamour

831
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,740
typhoon and sometimes if you have a name

832
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,090
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there that's actually I feel like</font>

833
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,890
that might have some points for

834
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:20,800
memorability especially if you know

835
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:21,970
someone by that name and I mean some of

836
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,800
this might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nitpicking but we're</font>

837
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:27,190
trying to make something that that makes

838
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:29,889
people have a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> fluid and pleasant</font>

839
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:31,750
experience and so little cultural things

840
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:34,320
are important to take into consideration

841
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,320
I guess

842
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:45,130
I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean for an excellent some</font>

843
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:47,830
names will translate differently for

844
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:50,770
example yeah Paris would be in English

845
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:52,449
per se yeah it's it's pronounced

846
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:57,340
differently and it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

847
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:58,900
different my name also so yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

848
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how you factored that in yeah</font>

849
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,890
totally that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's super tricky</font>

850
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:04,810
that it actually um subtitles are

851
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:06,610
interesting for that because subtitles

852
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:08,560
aren't isn't the same corpus depending

853
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:11,290
on the language like the media<font color="#E5E5E5"> we show</font>

854
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,720
it is all Anglo media but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look</font>

855
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:15,399
at the subtitles or you'll see tons of

856
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,470
material from like local news or

857
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,690
documentaries or material that may have

858
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:23,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">never been in English either enemy so so</font>

859
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:24,910
it actually will frequently represent

860
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:27,850
the local<font color="#E5E5E5"> culture it will see more of</font>

861
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:30,010
the local city names of the names of

862
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:31,419
people in that language or place that

863
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,770
can have its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems like come pick</font>

864
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,450
you know when you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the point of</font>

865
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:37,990
comparing like Brazilian Portuguese

866
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:40,990
versus a Portuguese Portuguese but you

867
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:43,540
know things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we paint like we said pain</font>

868
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:45,790
points so so other stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we haven't</font>

869
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:47,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite dealt with is words that are hard</font>

870
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,510
to spell occasionally we manually see

871
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,429
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's like oh my god this is</font>

872
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:53,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">a this might be a common word but people</font>

873
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:55,510
spell it wrong all the time like how

874
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:58,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">many people spell definitely wrong lots</font>

875
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:59,680
of people spell definitely wrong so it's

876
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,820
the kind of thing that you that we might

877
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,620
want to like just remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that word</font>

878
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,620
because we know sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of anecdotally that</font>

879
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:07,739
it's a tricky word to spell the other

880
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:10,810
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> words with short edit distances</font>

881
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:12,310
homophones that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

882
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:13,690
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a systematic way of dealing</font>

883
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:18,340
with it particularly not across

884
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:20,379
languages and we do so we're a pretty

885
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:22,240
multilingual team we're based out of

886
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:24,879
Montreal and so everything isn't always

887
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,529
in English and French and my native

888
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,360
language is Spanish and we've got some

889
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:30,280
Russian speakers on the team and a

890
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,480
Turkish speaker and we've got we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

891
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,710
a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a range but still we're</font>

892
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,020
branching out a lot in two languages

893
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:36,610
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have someone who can cook</font>

894
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,949
and obviously can notice the obvious

895
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:41,260
flags and one of the flags that we do

896
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:42,730
have so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually grammar which is</font>

897
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,169
and there's some stuff that in English

898
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:47,290
isn't as obvious but once you get into

899
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:48,730
most other languages things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

900
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:50,580
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have so the first</font>

901
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:52,500
Spanish example

902
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,299
noun that is masculine and plural

903
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,770
followed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> an adjective that is</font>

904
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,750
feminine<font color="#E5E5E5"> and singular so that actually</font>

905
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">causes a lot of cognitive dissonance and</font>

906
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:02,580
I mean we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any study to base</font>

907
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,940
this on but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's fairly jarring to</font>

908
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:07,529
see and probably that effects at least

909
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">the user experience</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if not the memorized</font>

910
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,010
ability because you would probably tend

911
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:14,189
to make them agree when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> typing it</font>

912
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:15,990
out so that's and the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

913
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:19,220
in French that's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example where the</font>

914
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:21,990
adjective is feminine and singular and

915
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:23,819
and the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and after it is plural</font>

916
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,379
so that's something that we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

917
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know like just taking</font>

918
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:31,740
roots of words and and making them agree

919
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,720
and then that actually can also help a

920
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,910
lot in terms of edit distance so if

921
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,080
anyone here speaks French French has

922
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,250
this thing where there's a lot of forms

923
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are spelled differently but they're</font>

924
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,360
pronounced the same and even native

925
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:44,400
speakers actually confuse them a ton so

926
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,840
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could actually just unify that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

927
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,190
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're only using one form</font>

928
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a verb that sounds and it protects</font>

929
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:52,500
and a particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> way that would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

930
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:56,190
go a long way to fixing people messing

931
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,380
that up so so yes and then when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

932
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:59,700
at grammar I mean each language has

933
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,650
particular things that we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

934
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,560
do and it's a gigantic rabbit hole to go

935
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,820
down so but that's that's something that

936
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,410
we're super interested in so if there

937
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:11,600
are any linguists in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would</font>

938
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:14,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely love to talk to you so um</font>

939
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:17,690
yeah there's some other cool stuff

940
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:19,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">Theresa so this actually came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out like a</font>

941
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,300
moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> of panic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when like two weeks</font>

942
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,580
before we were supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give this</font>

943
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:26,550
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> joven Oh released a new dice we're</font>

944
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:28,290
worthless that is phenomenal we're

945
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:31,590
really interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing around with</font>

946
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:33,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">us soon but basically they removed a lot</font>

947
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:35,280
of weird word from dice where they did

948
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,439
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar they source familiar</font>

949
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,420
words through ghent university center

950
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,160
for reading research remove difficult to

951
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:44,010
spell words and homophones remove vulgar

952
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,100
and offensive words and even did<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

953
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:48,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is fantastic it identified the</font>

954
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:52,080
concreteness of words and what they mean

955
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,780
by that is for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know picture</font>

956
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,580
a screwdriver<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's not hard you</font>

957
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,500
see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand a little metal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit but</font>

958
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:01,860
maybe star shape or whatever now now

959
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:04,010
picture love it's a lot easier in the

960
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,930
xkcd style to picture

961
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:07,580
concrete<font color="#E5E5E5"> objects if you were told to sit</font>

962
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:09,379
down here's five words that you can

963
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,819
picture now try to picture them like

964
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,160
that comic with a little horse and a

965
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:14,480
battery and a staple all together it's a

966
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:19,040
lot easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> than trying to picture what</font>

967
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:21,620
love looks like so thick um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

968
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,500
actually made three lists one is on the

969
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:26,540
initial dice where length one is a

970
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,370
reduced one that only requires four dice

971
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:31,640
instead hopefully speed up the process

972
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:33,290
of creation includes the most common

973
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,930
words and then another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that's</font>

974
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:38,150
actually designed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be tuned to</font>

975
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:40,370
autocorrect and autocomplete which could

976
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,630
be pretty fantastic on mobile in the

977
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:44,540
sense that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would only mean to ever</font>

978
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:47,840
type<font color="#CCCCCC"> three characters to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get your word</font>

979
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:49,670
automatically filled in each time so for

980
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,610
like a visual comparison you know we put

981
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:54,200
them up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see how these our wordless</font>

982
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:56,120
and the short and long ones might

983
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,830
compare one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to note on the short</font>

984
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,720
one is that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> autocomplete and</font>

985
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:01,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">autocorrect turned out to work well</font>

986
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,660
people weren't over typing every time

987
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,100
when they were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enter the words</font>

988
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,379
it would only be actually three

989
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,730
characters per word on the other hand I

990
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,620
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like password fields</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't usually</font>

991
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,670
allow outer cup autocomplete so that's a

992
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,200
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> another set of challenges</font>

993
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,850
there's don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some implementation</font>

994
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,129
challenges for auto correct and

995
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:19,339
autocomplete here um the other thing

996
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:21,290
which made rounds in like popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

997
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:23,720
know tech blogs and things like that for

998
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:26,750
a bit was research on passphrase poems

999
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,459
and someone went this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I oh my god</font>

1000
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:32,060
I'm embarrassed to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name God</font>

1001
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:34,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">finish odd and night</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and there sa how to</font>

1002
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:36,259
memorize a random<font color="#E5E5E5"> 60 bit string tried</font>

1003
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:38,540
comparing sentence formulations the xkcd

1004
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,370
method and poems because they were like

1005
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,980
you know the ancient<font color="#CCCCCC"> Greeks are able to</font>

1006
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:45,109
like memorize a thousand page epic poem

1007
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:48,370
maybe we could do this to memorize a few

1008
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:50,840
passwords and what they found was

1009
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:52,940
impressive so these were the recall

1010
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,440
rates for their<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference they're</font>

1011
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,870
different methods and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user</font>

1012
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:59,180
preference and the poetry method like

1013
00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:01,940
vastly outperformed the two sentence

1014
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:04,279
methods and even the xkcd method and

1015
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:07,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">importantly like people really liked the</font>

1016
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,290
poetry method versus the xkcd one users

1017
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:11,029
the young again when we set minimum

1018
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:12,380
standards you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice that users</font>

1019
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:14,660
actually preferred the ones that they

1020
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,100
got wrong so it's one of those things

1021
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,770
where maybe these are doesn't always

1022
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,270
know

1023
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:20,700
thus yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably one of those</font>

1024
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:22,400
things where they insert the correct

1025
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,870
grammatical forms rather than the

1026
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:31,890
incorrect ones there's two questions may

1027
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:33,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">be over there first no this is people</font>

1028
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:39,600
this is a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> small like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hands on</font>

1029
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:50,900
this is like a cool bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> there uh yeah</font>

1030
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:55,770
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a small study for sure possibly</font>

1031
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:59,570
because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were measuring</font>

1032
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:59,570
frustration but I don't remember exactly

1033
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:15,150
yeah yeah so ya know but we can also

1034
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,020
give you that stat that study if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1035
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:20,400
want to see it I'm sure we have it

1036
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:23,040
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's also cited</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decided yet so</font>

1037
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,970
some of the future work that we have in

1038
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,800
our in our development pipeline is some

1039
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:30,120
little things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can tweak in terms</font>

1040
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,450
of the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> interface and user</font>

1041
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:35,910
experience in general so we want to kind

1042
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:39,029
of provide some sort of incentive for

1043
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:40,379
people to do spaced repetition so you

1044
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:43,890
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if anyone has used</font>

1045
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:45,150
Aussie Aussie prompts you to enter your

1046
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:47,549
passphrase every once in a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

1047
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:49,500
sure you didn't forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on but if</font>

1048
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:51,930
that's honestly a little bit infuriating

1049
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:54,720
so we figure we can maybe add some spice

1050
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:56,520
to it by at minimum showing like a cute

1051
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,220
animation when you do it and maybe

1052
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:03,810
offering some rewards like more storage

1053
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:05,850
space<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our on our platform we can also</font>

1054
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:08,279
do some stuff around trimming ignoring

1055
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:10,020
and inserting white space for example so

1056
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,440
that if you get if you get the space is

1057
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:14,520
wrong we correct for that then looking

1058
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,590
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the autocorrect and autocomplete</font>

1059
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,030
stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joseph oh no has been doing</font>

1060
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:20,610
that that could be really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting so</font>

1061
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:23,100
we might we might dip dip our toes into

1062
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:26,070
that and then another question that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1063
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:28,290
just mostly are confused<font color="#E5E5E5"> by is how to</font>

1064
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:29,230
deal with special characters because you

1065
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:33,369
know you can

1066
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:35,109
you know we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> German dictionary but</font>

1067
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:36,730
if a German speaker has a German pass

1068
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:39,460
phrase that has a bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ohm loads and</font>

1069
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:42,190
maybe a nest set in it then like if they

1070
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,930
travel and they're accessing their their

1071
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:45,820
account from someone else's computer

1072
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:47,290
that doesn't have these characters then

1073
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,400
they might be a bit screwed so there's a

1074
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:50,740
couple of different ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we could</font>

1075
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,450
deal with that that we should we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

1076
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,160
take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at but that's that's</font>

1077
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:57,160
definitely something that's that's in

1078
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,109
our future the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether it</font>

1079
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:01,868
makes sense to let users choose some

1080
00:41:59,109 --> 00:42:03,310
things so that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like usually we</font>

1081
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:05,140
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a button that says regenerate</font>

1082
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:06,279
passphrase<font color="#E5E5E5"> regenerate passphrase and it</font>

1083
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,980
just cycles through a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> options</font>

1084
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,210
but we could allow people to just

1085
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:12,520
regenerate individual words instead of

1086
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:13,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole thing at once so if you know</font>

1087
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,650
if you got something that you like but

1088
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,420
the last word is something that you

1089
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:19,030
think you can't spell then you can just

1090
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:21,160
reroll that one or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font>

1091
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">allowing insertion of additional words</font>

1092
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">in between the ones that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were randomly</font>

1093
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:27,970
generated so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example like an article</font>

1094
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:30,100
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a preposition to make the sentence a</font>

1095
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:32,859
bit more sensical to you that could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1096
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:35,618
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could work and also just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1097
00:42:32,859 --> 00:42:37,180
know allowing insertion or edits to make

1098
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:40,900
something plural to add a suffix

1099
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:44,710
whatever that's that could be

1100
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:45,970
interesting as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well and we would still</font>

1101
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:48,460
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort of guaranteed minimum</font>

1102
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:49,810
amount of entropy from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the five or</font>

1103
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:53,800
more words<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are generated by the</font>

1104
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:55,270
system so so that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be cool the next</font>

1105
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,040
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up as well is</font>

1106
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:59,259
we're currently designing a field study

1107
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,109
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the folks at the University</font>

1108
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:03,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">University of Bonn and so what they have</font>

1109
00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:05,890
there have a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1110
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:08,590
generating<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass phrases and some control</font>

1111
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:09,730
encoding and whatnot and so what we're

1112
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:11,650
going to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

1113
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:13,630
research edition of P Rio or users will

1114
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:14,920
be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their regular account but</font>

1115
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,880
they will kind of go through a wizard

1116
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,369
that tells them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you are</font>

1117
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,950
participating<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a study we're going to</font>

1118
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:22,540
measure the following things and you

1119
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:24,069
will you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have your you</font>

1120
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:25,300
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be using your passphrase encoded in</font>

1121
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:29,170
a different way using a different

1122
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:32,560
generator so so that's we're going to

1123
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:35,710
test for memorability for speed of entry

1124
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,420
for accuracy and for user preference so

1125
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,650
right now what we're getting going

1126
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">through is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of designing that</font>

1127
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:42,190
study because it's fairly tricky to

1128
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:42,809
figure out how to control for certain

1129
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:46,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font>

1130
00:43:42,809 --> 00:43:47,650
and and then in general you know we're

1131
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:49,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">very interested in doing field studies</font>

1132
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:52,269
and working with academic institutions

1133
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:54,849
but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to interrupt I was gonna wait</font>

1134
00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:59,828
until you're ready all right I I am I

1135
00:43:54,849 --> 00:44:03,989
have switched slides did you make it

1136
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:17,249
outrageous speaker request today yeah

1137
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:19,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jasper cats oh yeah that's amazing sweet</font>

1138
00:44:17,249 --> 00:44:21,578
that is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the best thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1139
00:44:19,779 --> 00:44:25,150
has ever happened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me it wasn't even</font>

1140
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:27,970
me it was you this is why it never hurts

1141
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:29,739
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask all right I have learned another</font>

1142
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:32,109
thing today not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> what an epicyclic</font>

1143
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:34,839
is um so as I was saying in terms of

1144
00:44:32,109 --> 00:44:36,489
designing in designing studies I mean we

1145
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:39,130
are a security secure communications

1146
00:44:36,489 --> 00:44:40,660
tool so it's very tricky and we don't

1147
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:42,700
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn this into this kind of like</font>

1148
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,868
horrible thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't read</font>

1149
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,269
where you're like clicking through a

1150
00:44:43,869 --> 00:44:47,529
bunch of like text so there's a lot of a

1151
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:49,479
lot to be done in terms of designing

1152
00:44:47,529 --> 00:44:51,579
transparent studies and having people

1153
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,470
actually understand what it is that they

1154
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:55,239
might be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to opt into so that's</font>

1155
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:56,410
that's a really tricky question it's one

1156
00:44:55,239 --> 00:45:01,089
that we'd also love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to folks</font>

1157
00:44:56,410 --> 00:45:03,069
about and on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> note there's a lot of</font>

1158
00:45:01,089 --> 00:45:07,058
ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we would love for you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys to</font>

1159
00:45:03,069 --> 00:45:09,249
help out so we would love to have native

1160
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:12,309
speakers review our dictionaries so I

1161
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:14,799
had a it's it really helps for example I

1162
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:15,940
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> to luckily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speak German but I</font>

1163
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:17,859
hadn't caught this until we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

1164
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:20,259
preparing for this talk that actually

1165
00:45:17,859 --> 00:45:24,369
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were generating our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> German list</font>

1166
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:27,609
we left out nouns entirely because

1167
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:28,989
because they're capitalized yeah and and

1168
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:31,359
we and our script just<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't account</font>

1169
00:45:28,989 --> 00:45:33,130
for that and yeah and luckily I was like

1170
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:35,980
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like regenerating in German was</font>

1171
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:38,589
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're announced what the hell and</font>

1172
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:41,019
then it occurred to me why and so I need

1173
00:45:38,589 --> 00:45:42,999
to go regenerate that so the other thing

1174
00:45:41,019 --> 00:45:46,419
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you are dictionaries there</font>

1175
00:45:42,999 --> 00:45:48,098
freely available and just use<font color="#E5E5E5"> our pass</font>

1176
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:50,049
phrases if you want we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a standalone</font>

1177
00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:51,849
passphrase generator passphrases

1178
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:54,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">periodico more you can just roll in any</font>

1179
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:56,170
of the languages you can also come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

1180
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:58,328
with any research that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> missed</font>

1181
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:00,010
or any research that you want to do and

1182
00:45:58,329 --> 00:46:02,470
we're also we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would love to collaborate</font>

1183
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:04,900
with more folks from from the research

1184
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:07,118
community and yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'd love to work</font>

1185
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:09,460
on field<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests specifically if folks are</font>

1186
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,559
interested in that so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact us</font>

1187
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:14,980
through twitter and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> check out</font>

1188
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:16,809
our the pass phrases site you can check

1189
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,819
out the app as well and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> check</font>

1190
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:21,400
out our code on github the app is itself

1191
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:22,990
open source so yeah that's I think

1192
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's all we have for you when we say</font>

1193
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,140
research I really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stress that we</font>

1194
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:28,660
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just mean security researchers if</font>

1195
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:31,299
your intellect UX usability design like

1196
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:34,750
we feel like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really crucial and</font>

1197
00:46:31,299 --> 00:46:37,089
often underappreciated and underutilized

1198
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:39,579
skill set within the security community

1199
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:40,869
so even if it's like what colors you

1200
00:46:39,579 --> 00:46:42,040
think the passphrase it should be when

1201
00:46:40,869 --> 00:46:43,540
they're presented the users<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help</font>

1202
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:46,960
memorability like we want to talk about

1203
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:55,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">that yeah absolutely all right thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1204
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:57,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah they come out so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before I open for</font>

1205
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:59,950
questions i'm just going to say that

1206
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">Scylla you told me and you really real</font>

1207
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:04,808
it yourself you didn't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass</font>

1208
00:47:02,349 --> 00:47:07,809
races was like one a half years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

1209
00:47:04,809 --> 00:47:09,640
that's care and flow you say you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1210
00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:12,280
an information security researcher you

1211
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:14,640
consider yourself to be just a developer

1212
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:18,970
I'm a developer for sure yeah I am

1213
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:21,609
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazed about this talk so I I</font>

1214
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:24,848
will actually you know one more round of

1215
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:29,049
applause first this is really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1216
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:30,880
now for<font color="#CCCCCC"> now for questions raise your</font>

1217
00:47:29,049 --> 00:47:33,670
hands Oh Jeff wants to ask a question

1218
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:38,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">well I'm actually going to bypass Jeff</font>

1219
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:41,400
first too much enthusiasm there you go

1220
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:44,980
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a pretty maybe obvious</font>

1221
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:47,020
question have you considered since you

1222
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:48,369
even named them<font color="#E5E5E5"> sentences have you</font>

1223
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:50,170
considered making the phrases that are

1224
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:54,599
longer than a couple of words maybe more

1225
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:56,799
syntactically arranged to improve

1226
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:58,960
memorability so that was actually one of

1227
00:47:56,799 --> 00:48:01,690
our first thoughts in that last study we

1228
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,520
you know briefly went over the poetry

1229
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:06,130
one actually found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they tended to</font>

1230
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:08,500
not work<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the problem with it was</font>

1231
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:09,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">that on one side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they got longer when</font>

1232
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,619
used

1233
00:48:09,339 --> 00:48:14,349
to get randomly generated sentences it

1234
00:48:11,619 --> 00:48:16,749
that also aren't you know easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

1235
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:19,749
up in a dictionary type attacker but<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

1236
00:48:16,749 --> 00:48:22,089
quotes yeah you end up with fairly long

1237
00:48:19,749 --> 00:48:24,459
sentences and users were really good at

1238
00:48:22,089 --> 00:48:27,160
remembering like the semantic meaning of

1239
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:28,749
the sentence but they weren't in fact we

1240
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,299
might actually solve it open but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1241
00:48:28,749 --> 00:48:33,118
weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good at remembering the</font>

1242
00:48:31,299 --> 00:48:40,719
specifics it would be like they uh

1243
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:42,579
where's this is reversed yes so we do

1244
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:44,140
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here so they would remember things</font>

1245
00:48:42,579 --> 00:48:46,749
like those are some more examples of

1246
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:48,578
poems but<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are sentences right so</font>

1247
00:48:46,749 --> 00:48:50,140
it would be like they'd be assigned no

1248
00:48:48,579 --> 00:48:51,549
dressing allowed under canon law in the

1249
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:54,069
youth group<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the person would</font>

1250
00:48:51,549 --> 00:48:55,450
remember no dress is allowed and that

1251
00:48:54,069 --> 00:48:57,880
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually what result was the</font>

1252
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:59,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">biggest failure for the recall rate for</font>

1253
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,029
these types of sentences which is why we

1254
00:48:59,349 --> 00:49:03,880
were a little more interested in the

1255
00:49:01,029 --> 00:49:05,200
user introducing<font color="#E5E5E5"> their you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1256
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,089
constructing their sentences because

1257
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,618
then it actually arguably would add more

1258
00:49:07,089 --> 00:49:10,119
entropy right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can't</font>

1259
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:12,130
just do a dictionary attack of like well

1260
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:14,349
we generated all these words but did the

1261
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:17,499
user add an article to it did they

1262
00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:20,349
change you know a sonics<font color="#CCCCCC"> I meant a</font>

1263
00:49:17,499 --> 00:49:24,089
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit or less drastic sentence</font>

1264
00:49:20,349 --> 00:49:26,259
construction but I can talk to clear no

1265
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:28,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">qualm is is so with our state our</font>

1266
00:49:26,259 --> 00:49:31,420
standard with 67.5 bits these are only

1267
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:33,880
60 bits I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna make sure that they</font>

1268
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:40,319
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the positive I see everybody</font>

1269
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:43,690
gets to discuss with them all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right yep</font>

1270
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:46,569
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is fantastic you've been struggling</font>

1271
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:48,640
and working with the same problems that

1272
00:49:46,569 --> 00:49:51,940
we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about with one</font>

1273
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:54,339
password and trying to and and master

1274
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:57,609
passwords and by the way i'm a PhD drop

1275
00:49:54,339 --> 00:49:59,440
out in linguistics I actually have a

1276
00:49:57,609 --> 00:50:04,808
bachelor's degree in linguistics but I

1277
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:06,579
don't talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hey um so yeah you</font>

1278
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:09,400
know so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you had a smelly because um</font>

1279
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:15,009
anyway i'll talk to you about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

1280
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:17,200
done about unicode and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had a whole</font>

1281
00:50:15,009 --> 00:50:19,210
bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different questions and points</font>

1282
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,279
which ball going out my hand so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font>

1283
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:22,160
just mentioned one in the word list<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1284
00:50:21,279 --> 00:50:29,470
I help

1285
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:29,470
drugged we deliberately chose toy

1286
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:37,130
derivational morphology yeah so that we

1287
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:41,210
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a dresses dressing problem</font>

1288
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:43,069
with memorability oh right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the one</font>

1289
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:46,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">other question is where did you get your</font>

1290
00:50:43,069 --> 00:50:49,450
taboo words for non-english when you

1291
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:52,609
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were excluding offensive words</font>

1292
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:53,750
mostly from actual people know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1293
00:50:52,609 --> 00:50:56,058
there's a there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some existing</font>

worthless it was this was like one of my

1295
00:50:56,059 --> 00:51:00,980
more fun weeks at work where I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1296
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:02,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">like my job is to find all the offensive</font>

1297
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:05,390
words in all the languages possible and

1298
00:51:02,839 --> 00:51:07,578
put them all in one giant nasty list of

1299
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:09,950
like eight thousand lines long and you

1300
00:51:07,579 --> 00:51:11,660
should come to Norway because the higher

1301
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:14,710
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> higher up north and know where you</font>

1302
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:18,259
go the more common is to actually use

1303
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:22,670
really seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong bad language as</font>

1304
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:27,470
part of your everyday talking to anyone

1305
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:29,329
we yeah yeah pretty much you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like</font>

1306
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:30,859
if you come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> there like from from Oslo</font>

1307

hallway that you know they will they

1309
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:36,200
were just<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at feel sorry for you</font>

1310
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:39,020
because you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a you know you know</font>

1311
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:42,649
capable of saying like every second

1312
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:43,700
sentence as an example we did so um 10

1313
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:45,859
we did have something interesting when

1314
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:47,270
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to source this list um so I don't</font>

1315
00:51:45,859 --> 00:51:52,160
have anyone here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is familiar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with violet</font>

1316
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:57,160
blue<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so her name shows up on a</font>

1317
00:51:52,160 --> 00:52:00,020
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> offensive band worthless and weak</font>

1318
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:01,730
and when someone who'd was trying to you

1319
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:03,319
know go through our list to evaluate it

1320
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:04,760
like got really angry at us they're like

1321
00:52:03,319 --> 00:52:07,460
what's so offensive about violet blue

1322
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,990
and we're like oh we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will take</font>

1323
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:12,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">that office there's nothing offensive to</font>

1324
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:14,149
us but yeah there are older oh yeah she

1325
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:17,990
saw on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter if it's there this was</font>

1326
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:19,670
very public one other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we did for</font>

1327
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:21,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">the offensive master list is we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1328
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:23,690
took out words like nationalities or

1329
00:52:21,619 --> 00:52:24,950
religions because that could that's

1330
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">better than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taking out negative</font>

1331
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:29,180
adjectives and we ended up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1332
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:31,130
awkward pass phrases with constructions

1333
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:34,069
like disgusting

1334
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:37,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">named country and it's like okay well</font>

1335
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:40,070
this is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice yeah I don't ask</font>

1336
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:42,410
very many questions but because I'm a

1337
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:45,380
spelling dropout you<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention</font>

1338
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:47,629
difficulties what's wrong with leaving

1339
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:50,890
spelling difficulties in there if you

1340
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:53,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">really can spell them it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pertains to you</font>

1341
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:57,080
versus forcing me to spell something

1342
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:58,460
like somebody else spells it I don't

1343
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:01,370
know if I have described it correctly

1344
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:03,920
you mentioned you use the word difficult

1345
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:05,750
as a mixer make a spell it but possibly

1346
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,930
I can't spell it but I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> can but</font>

1347
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:10,580
anyway why can't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font>

1348
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:13,910
spelling difficulties I mean why are you

1349
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:17,060
restricted to to what you say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> must</font>

1350
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:19,700
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> why couldn't a person actually use</font>

1351
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:22,130
their own individual spelling

1352
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:27,680
difficulties even in relation to the

1353
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:30,110
words so if I made myself and then yeah

1354
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:32,270
yeah if you can misspelled the thing

1355
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:34,130
correctly why would you force me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

1356
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:37,820
to remember something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I can't spell</font>

1357
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:39,380
right anyway so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where um towards</font>

1358
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:41,840
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we were saying it could be</font>

1359
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:43,790
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to allow users to have some</font>

1360
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,440
control so the user is able to write

1361
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:46,970
their whole passphrase everything we

1362
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,680
said in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning it will probably</font>

1363
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:51,080
apply because people are bad at making

1364
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:52,940
their passwords but if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> say here's</font>

1365
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:55,130
some random content and you can play

1366
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:57,460
around with it a bit like oh you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1367
00:53:55,130 --> 00:54:00,620
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know I always spell definitely</font>

1368
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:03,080
with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I instead or something like</font>

1369
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:04,430
that then it could be possible that we

1370
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:06,860
could say well you're allowed to change

1371
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:10,580
two or three characters in any word

1372
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:12,110
which if anything would and because

1373
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:14,799
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you can just replace all the</font>

1374
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:14,800
words with password

1375
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:28,649
yeah it's but we're tryna we are

1376
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:30,359
deliberately trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set a fairly low</font>

1377
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:37,380
bar and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that any of</font>

1378
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:38,819
the words would<font color="#CCCCCC"> um but yeah but but I</font>

1379
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,989
see your<font color="#E5E5E5"> point though in terms of</font>

1380
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:42,509
spelling like especially if you consider

1381
00:54:39,989 --> 00:54:44,549
British versus American spelling we

1382
00:54:42,509 --> 00:54:47,880
don't want to force one Spelling or

1383
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:49,859
another but we know I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are right</font>

1384
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,789
now yes we are definitely but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we that's</font>

1385
00:54:49,859 --> 00:54:52,710
the kind of thing that we should

1386
00:54:50,789 --> 00:55:01,519
consider allowing the user to modify

1387
00:54:52,710 --> 00:55:04,859
that yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right fair enough yeah</font>

1388
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:06,899
sure yep so related to the earlier point

1389
00:55:04,859 --> 00:55:08,519
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Norway have you considered the</font>

1390
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:11,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">option of letting people choose to</font>

1391
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:15,209
include vulgar words cuz yes he has more

1392
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:18,390
rememberable not we've done that we've

1393
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:20,460
also like on the side for fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

1394
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:22,739
symptoms dictionary I have a Klingon

1396
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:25,529
apparently there's a lot of internal

1397
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:27,839
disagreements about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are</font>

1398
00:55:25,529 --> 00:55:29,579
spelled and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> formatted but like I was</font>

1399
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:30,900
I was not ready for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's another</font>

1400
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:33,059
case where people shows people to pick

1401
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,769
their spelling yeah um there's been

1402
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:38,789
requests for Elvis dictionaries there's

1403
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:41,098
like um<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah now there's a lot on the</font>

1404
00:55:38,789 --> 00:55:42,720
table for that I'm gonna leave it to to

1405
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:45,450
all run over to ask you the final

1406
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,430
question first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all let me just</font>

1407
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:49,980
reiterate that this is a really nice

1408
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:54,419
piece of work and I'm very impressed and

1409
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:56,430
if you guys generate a 776 word list I'd

1410
00:55:54,420 --> 00:56:00,720
be happy to link it from the dice for a

1411
00:55:56,430 --> 00:56:03,210
page if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you like that oh and then not to</font>

1412
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:06,269
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> defensive one little quibble is when</font>

1413
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:11,339
you're comparing I mean a five-word dice

1414
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:14,129
worth<font color="#E5E5E5"> passphrase has 65 64.5 bits of</font>

1415
00:56:11,339 --> 00:56:17,190
entropy so yes a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> less than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1416
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:20,249
target comparing at this six is a little

1417
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:21,720
bit pushing it yeah that's not my true I

1418
00:56:20,249 --> 00:56:22,980
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a mistake on ours because</font>

1419
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,640
we were supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be comparing it with</font>

1420
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:32,279
the 1296 dictionaries that just came out

1421
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:33,089
which would be a 64 anyone else you know

1422
00:56:32,279 --> 00:56:35,310
I

1423
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:39,420
I want you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that I spent hours</font>

working on this but not weeks so so and

1425
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:43,620
and and one of the challenge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

1426
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,540
just be aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're going to have</font>

1427
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:47,460
to redo this regularly because the

1428
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:49,650
culture changes every night one of my

1429

00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:59,880
was like I'm yeah I'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should</font>

1433
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:01,950
you know but but you know that they live

1434
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:04,170
in out of business<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have some years</font>

1435
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:06,270
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be very familiar in the 1990s</font>

1436
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:08,340
there it would drop off the top of your

1437
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:11,160
tongue and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like why why do you have</font>

1438
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:13,800
1987 in there right i mean so there

1439
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,690
there is a there is a great process

1440
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:18,150
involved here and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> final</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I was</font>

1441
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:20,610
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to suggest is one of it because or</font>

1442
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:23,160
an exhibit on my little to-do list that

1443
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:24,960
I may never get to is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really don't</font>

1444
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:27,899
want to generate actual sentences

1445
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,550
because they can be weak passwords

1446
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:32,100
because they may actually turn up in a

1447
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:34,680
search list that were generated from

1448
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:36,180
songs or whatever and they're at least

1449
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:38,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">in English there's like a handful of</font>

1450
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:42,930
words like the forms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the verb to be</font>

1451
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:44,640
and a few pronouns that basically and

1452
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:46,640
articles that if you remove them from

1453
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,420
your list you eliminate like

1454
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,220
seventy-five percent of possible

1455
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:53,460
sentences so that's something you might

1456
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:55,859
also want to think about um so two

1457
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:57,470
things 1i should say yeah we were

1458
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:59,880
actually worried we're like we're like

1459
00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:03,000
crap we probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> go we being too</font>

1460
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:05,100
critical of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dates where um because we uh</font>

1461
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,150
you know again I started with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this like</font>

1462
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:08,400
a year and a half ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I basically</font>

1463
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:12,570
read everything on the die to our

1464
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,980
website to get to get to here as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1465
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:16,290
content one of the fun things about

1466
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:18,660
subtitles is that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get</font>

1467
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:20,820
updated every year you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> new seasons</font>

1468
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:23,819
of TV shows come out and news new show

1469
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:26,490
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> come out entirely so it does</font>

1470
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:29,400
actually helped as far as a source of

1471
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:33,180
language to stay somewhat relevant in

1472
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,650
fact I think you're even um you could if

1473
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:36,240
you want it the one through the effort

1474
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:37,980
actually narrow it down I only want to

1475
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:41,970
take subtitles from shows that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font>

1476
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:42,930
released<font color="#E5E5E5"> from between these years so</font>

1477
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:43,779
there's some fun things you can play

1478
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:51,640
around with subtitle

1479
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:54,540
the source yeah ok so again applause for

1480
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,540
30
