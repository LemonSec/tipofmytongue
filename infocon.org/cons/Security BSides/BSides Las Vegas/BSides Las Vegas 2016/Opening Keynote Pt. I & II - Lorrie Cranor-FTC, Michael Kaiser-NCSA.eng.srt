1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,310
due to technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficulties we are</font>

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:07,619
joining the program already in progress

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:10,590
they don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have empirical data</font>

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:14,639
but they do a nice theoretical model and

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,680
they looked at the notion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of well you</font>

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,640
have an attacker who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a brute</font>

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:23,279
force attack against your passwords and

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:26,070
if you have all your users change their

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,650
password then the attacker has to start

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,320
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that's going to slow them</font>

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,680
down if every 60 or 90 days they have to

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,840
start over with their brute force attack

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,269
but they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to model this and</font>

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,660
show that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually it doesn't slow the</font>

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,300
attacker down very much and in fact you

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,029
can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> much better gains by using a</font>

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,339
slower hashing algorithm that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

18
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,770
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better way to slow down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,980
attacker than to make everybody change

20
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,109
their passwords every 60 90 days and by

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,828
using a slower hashing algorithm you're

22
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:04,110
not inconveniencing your users they also

23
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,900
point out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you have an attacker</font>

24
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,119
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows your passwords well they can</font>

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,460
install a keylogger into your system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,979
now when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> change their password</font>

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,979
they can watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user actually do that</font>

28
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:21,720
there's also some survey evidence that

29
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,939
shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> that changing passwords on a</font>

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,509
regular basis may not be all that

31
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:30,029
helpful so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> some work that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

32
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,920
done actually a while ago but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think if</font>

33
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,430
you repeated this today you'd find very

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,770
similar things where users say when I

35
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,689
know I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change my password I</font>

36
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,240
don't put that much effort into creating

37
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,199
a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> password in the first place and</font>

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,240
so these users create weaker passwords

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,280
there was also a study that my students

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,939
did at Carnegie Mellon<font color="#CCCCCC"> University and</font>

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,210
this is with currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> melon users and</font>

42
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,250
their passwords so we set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a system so</font>

43
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,259
that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> people change their password</font>

44
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,840
afterwards they were asked to fill<font color="#CCCCCC"> out a</font>

45
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,210
survey and the survey<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked them among</font>

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,190
other things how annoyed were they right

47
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,670
now for having to change this password

48
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,859
and we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to correlate this with</font>

49
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,140
the

50
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,330
us word that they had just<font color="#E5E5E5"> created and</font>

51
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,010
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to show that the people who</font>

52
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,710
said that they were really annoyed

53
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:25,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">really pissed off right now they were</font>

54
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,720
the ones who had the weakest passwords

55
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:32,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so I took all of this evidence</font>

56
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,240
and I put it together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote a blog</font>

57
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,350
post about this and it was posted on the

58
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">front page of the FTC website one of the</font>

59
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:43,400
cool things about being the chief

60
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,100
technologist at the FTC is I get to post

61
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,200
these blogs on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the front page of the FTC</font>

62
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,780
website and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get read by a</font>

63
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,700
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and my understanding is</font>

64
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,410
that this particular blog post got

65
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,470
forwarded to a lot of system

66
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,660
administrators and I've heard that a

67
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,420
small number of them actually changed

68
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:06,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the policy now I've also heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

69
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:10,089
others who said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm I I might be</font>

70
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,799
convinced but I still<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't feel like I</font>

71
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:16,310
can do this I still might get criticism

72
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:20,209
I need standards that tell me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

73
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:25,010
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's not enough just to see this</font>

74
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:28,070
on the FTC blog we got a lot of press

75
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:30,170
coverage a lot of a lot of reporters

76
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:33,140
were very interested in the idea that

77
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:36,768
maybe this password expiry is not such a

78
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:40,880
good idea I'm not the only one saying

79
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:42,650
this in the UK CES<font color="#CCCCCC"> G has also been</font>

80
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,810
saying that they blogged about this

81
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,880
recently and they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a report</font>

82
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,820
that came out I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year that</font>

83
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:53,570
explained why this was not necessarily

84
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:56,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">such a good idea and then in May NIST</font>

85
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:59,780
came out with the preview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their new</font>

86
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:02,450
guidelines about passwords which I you

87
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,390
will hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in a session later this</font>

88
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:08,209
morning but among other things these new

89
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:11,179
guidelines suggests that you don't have

90
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:13,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">regular password expiry so hopefully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

91
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:18,410
will have this as part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a standard</font>

92
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:21,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">that people can point to so if password</font>

93
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,889
expiry is not really going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help us</font>

94
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,569
what will help us

95
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:28,120
there's all sorts of ideas that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

96
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:30,219
have I want to highlight a little bit of

97
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,379
research that my students at<font color="#CCCCCC"> carnegie</font>

98
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:35,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">mellon have been doing to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

99
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:37,900
understand how we can help people<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

100
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:41,020
stronger passwords and one approach is

101
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:44,830
to address misconceptions that people

102
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:47,080
have about passwords so we've done

103
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:50,020
studies where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> invite people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into our</font>

104
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,479
lab and we watch them create passwords

105
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,620
and talk to them about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the passwords</font>

106
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,210
that they create a really common

107
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:01,870
misconception<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that keyboard patterns</font>

108
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:03,909
are secure we see people<font color="#E5E5E5"> create keyboard</font>

109
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:07,000
pattern passwords and they're so proud

110
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:09,550
of them Oh aren't I so clever this look

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,029
so random but I just go diagonally down

112
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:14,529
the keyboard and some of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

113
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:16,750
will even say yeah I know if I went

114
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:19,949
across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the keyboard oh that's probably</font>

115
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:23,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad but I went diagonal isn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that great</font>

116
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:26,110
we need to make people<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware that that</font>

117
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:29,650
is a misconception another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

118
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:33,129
favorites adding ! on the end will make

119
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:35,500
it more secure and of course we all know

120
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:37,990
that that is wrong but we have seen

121
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,289
users in our lab create a password and

122
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:43,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">they say oh yeah monkeys not a very good</font>

123
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:48,839
password but all that ! on the end now

124
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:52,689
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really secure we did a study online</font>

125
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:54,399
my student blazer led the study and he

126
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:57,610
presented it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the spring at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Chi</font>

127
00:05:54,399 --> 00:06:00,250
conference in this online study we gave

128
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,710
people pairs of passwords and we asked

129
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:06,009
them to tell us which one is more secure

130
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,878
or are they equally secure so I we're

131
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:08,889
going out a little audience

132
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,830
participation here I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all to try</font>

133
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:13,870
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I have two passwords and</font>

134
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,580
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are going to tell me by show of</font>

135
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,740
hands whether the one on the left or the

136
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,830
right or whether they're equally secure

137
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:23,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we have I love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you 88 and I eat</font>

138
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:29,529
kale 88 so raise your hand if you think

139
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:31,629
I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> you 88 is more secure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay raise</font>

140
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:34,090
your hand if you think they're equally

141
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:36,669
secure

142
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:41,679
and now raise your hand if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

143
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:43,990
eat kale 88 is more secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font>

144
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,419
interesting we have we have some split

145
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,540
decision here our study participants

146
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:50,830
thought they were equally secure

147
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,120
probably they looked at them and said

148
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,729
well they're the same number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of letters</font>

149
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,880
they have the same numbers in them

150
00:06:54,729 --> 00:07:00,909
they're kind of similar but actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> IE</font>

151
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:07,810
kale 88 is<font color="#CCCCCC"> four trillion times more</font>

152
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:10,930
secure yeah so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this well I love</font>

153
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,850
you is one of the most common words in

154
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,320
passwords it's somewhere really big on

155
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,860
my dress which if you haven't noticed

156
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,990
contains the 500 most common passwords

157
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,580
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rocky data breach all right if</font>

158
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:25,020
your password is on my dress definitely

159
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:30,340
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a time to change your password</font>

160
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:34,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so so I eat kale 88 much more</font>

161
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:36,729
secure or until now because<font color="#E5E5E5"> apparently</font>

162
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:40,030
people don't eat kale or maybe they

163
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:43,330
don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to brag about it all right</font>

164
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:48,190
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> try one more which is more secure</font>

165
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:50,560
Brooklyn 16 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brooklyn q why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

166
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:55,450
raise your hand for Brooklyn 16 more

167
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:59,590
secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay got a few hands raise your</font>

168
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:03,700
hand for their equally secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm and</font>

169
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:06,340
raise<font color="#E5E5E5"> your hand for Brooklyn qy a lot</font>

170
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:09,039
more hands there ok so our study

171
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,739
participants thought that Brooklyn 16

172
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,990
was more secure probably because they

173
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,860
saw the numbers and said numbers and

174
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:20,289
passwords are good but as many of you do

175
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:23,470
Brooklyn qy is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 300 thousand times more</font>

176
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:25,780
secure and the reason for that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> q</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

177
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,990
is a much less common thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be in a</font>

178
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:32,890
password<font color="#E5E5E5"> than 16 and so it actually ends</font>

179
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:35,620
up being more secure so what we found is

180
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:39,760
our participants were not completely

181
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:41,919
wrong so they knew to<font color="#CCCCCC"> avoid common names</font>

182
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">raises they just didn't realize that I</font>

183
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,170
love<font color="#E5E5E5"> you was a really common phrase they</font>

184
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:49,750
knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that digits and symbols were good</font>

185
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,270
and added strength of their password but

186
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,130
they they were oversold they thought

187
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:57,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there were that they provided</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

188
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:59,830
more security than they actually do and

189
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:01,810
interestingly at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our survey</font>

190
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,940
we asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> them about what types of</font>

191
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:06,130
attacks they thought their password

192
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,140
would have to withstand how many guesses

193
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,350
do you think an attacker is going to

194
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:14,230
make well some people correctly said a

195
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,970
really really big number as many digits

196
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,400
as they could fit in the little box we

197
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:21,040
gave them but there were a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

198
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,980
who gave us one digit numbers for the

199
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,040
number of guesses in their mental model

200
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,320
of the situation they assumed only that

201
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,449
online attacker and really had no idea

202
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there were any other types of</font>

203
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,070
attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they needed to worry about</font>

204
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,620
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the mental model you have</font>

205
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:42,790
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be difficult to actually</font>

206
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:45,130
create a strong password and a lot of

207
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:48,400
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the feedback that we</font>

208
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:51,010
give users the password meters that are

209
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,170
on a lot of websites don't really give

210
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:55,630
users the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feedback that they</font>

211
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">would need to actually create a stronger</font>

212
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:00,280
password you know it tells you your

213
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,680
password is weak and that you need to

214
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,770
create a stronger password<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how do I</font>

215
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:08,229
do that most of these password meters

216
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,270
don't really tell you so my students at

217
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:12,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">Carnegie Mellon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are working on an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">source password meter that besides</font>

219
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,439
having a good scoring mechanism will

220
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,320
provide what we hope will be really

221
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,720
useful feedback to the users and that's

222
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,000
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> under development right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now and</font>

223
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,080
hopefully you'll hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at this</font>

we're all about at the National Cyber

Security Alliance looks like we have

257
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,339
this going here holding on for one

258
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,660

education and awareness and

265
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,839
cybersecurity meaning teaching everybody

266
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:42,630
how to use the internet more safely and

267
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:44,520
securely<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we work with companies</font>

all around the globe we work with

National Cyber Security Alliance I'll

277
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,010
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

278
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,000
a minute but i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really going to talk</font>

279
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,040
about creating a culture of

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,280
cybersecurity to stop think connect

281
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,719
campaign anybody heard of that yes a few

282
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,380
people you should all know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

283
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,310
National Cyber Security Awareness Month

284
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,380
everybody should<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I know a lot of you know a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PWG here's</font>

291
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,710
our board member companies these are the

292
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,630
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that support us with funding but</font>

293
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,610
also with<font color="#CCCCCC"> some some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> power hoops it's</font>

294
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,840
kind of going ahead there look I'm going

295
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,060
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about a culture of</font>

296
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">cybersecurity here but let me give you</font>

297
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:47,219
some basic truths about cybersecurity we

298
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,689
are only as strong as a weakest link it

299
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,310
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you are in that</font>

300
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,600
chain if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a home user or</font>

301
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,670
you're all the way up to protecting the

302
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">most important government or endured</font>

303
00:13:53,670 --> 00:14:00,360
industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise any weak link</font>

304
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:02,400
affects us all the other truth we hold

305
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,920
to be self evident is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity</font>

306
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,620
is a shared responsibility right that

307
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,839
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us play a role somewhere</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> along</font>

308
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,730
the way in doing things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the</font>

309
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet safer more secure and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trusted</font>

310
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:17,070
we like to say that everything you do to

311
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:20,130
be safer actually makes the internet

312
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,840
more secure for everybody else right so

313
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,820
that's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important notion that</font>

314
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:28,680
we've tested with people and is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

315
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:30,900
strong but let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how we talk</font>

316
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,540
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity this is how we</font>

317
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:36,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">normally talk about it we make it scary</font>

318
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,980
right it's all these fear kind of

319
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,689
notions there are hijackers there are

320
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,730
viruses there's crime you could be

321
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,380
attacked you could lose things you can

322
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,410
lose<font color="#CCCCCC"> your identity all those things</font>

323
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:50,010
these are the outcomes of bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

324
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:52,829
and we make it scary we tell people lock

325
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:54,840
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down don't use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it don't do this don't</font>

326
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,850
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you have teenagers</font>

327
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,790
and if you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> them a don't rule you</font>

328
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:01,950
expect them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow it not going to</font>

329
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen that's human nature when you tell</font>

330
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:07,710
people don't do things they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

331
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:09,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">to listen how many of us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

332
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:12,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting up walls between us and what we</font>

333
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to do online right that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

334
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,290
we talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about security if your</font>

335
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">insecurity you need to talk this way</font>

336
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,189
right this is

337
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,080
your discipline this is what you do but

338
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,300
when we talk about educating people to

339
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,070
be safer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and secure online if we tell</font>

340
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">them you're not allowed to do things</font>

341
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,670
don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

342
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,620
listen to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us so we should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never be</font>

343
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:38,280
surprised when they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow the</font>

344
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:41,760
rules but what have we talked about

345
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:44,040
security as enabling what have<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked</font>

346
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,439
about building a safe and trusted

347
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,410
internet isn't about stopping people

348
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:53,250
from doing things building walls around

349
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:56,910
what they're doing but actually good

350
00:15:53,250 --> 00:16:00,060
security allows you to do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you</font>

351
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:02,370
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do online it lets you join</font>

352
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,709
communities be connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> with other</font>

353
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,870
people it allows you to engage<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

354
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:09,240
commerce it allows you to engage<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

355
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:10,830
content and that's the way we start

356
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,170
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people about cyber security</font>

357
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:15,870
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> being safe online about enabling</font>

358
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:18,599
them to do the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> they want to do as</font>

359
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,640
opposed to stopping them from doing the

360
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:30,449
things they want to do this is a change

361
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:32,339
in the way people talk about security so

362
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:35,069
why would I have a picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

363
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:38,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">telephone in a cybersecurity discussion</font>

364
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:42,748
and not just a telephone an analog

365
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:46,378
telephone a rotary dial telephone that's

366
00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:48,230
outlived its usefulness because when you

367
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:51,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it the internet is a</font>

368
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:53,069
transformational technology right the

369
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:56,040
technology we're doing is changing the

370
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:57,949
world well guess what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> device was a</font>

371
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,169
transformational technology as well

372
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:02,939
right before the telephone the way we

373
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:04,740
communicated people was totally

374
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:07,678
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's something about</font>

375
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">this pots or plain old telephone service</font>

376
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,860
that was really critical<font color="#CCCCCC"> to its success</font>

377
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:16,888
over time and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was when you picked</font>

378
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:18,719
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> that receiver there was a ninety-nine</font>

379
00:17:16,888 --> 00:17:21,990
point nine percent chance that you were

380
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get a dial tone right that was</font>

381
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:27,689
what they live by and it was safe it was

382
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:29,519
reliable and for the most part it was

383
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:30,870
secure we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into some discussions</font>

384
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,880
about that obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> their ways to get</font>

385
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:35,518
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> telephone calls but in generally it</font>

386
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,429
was considered to be secure if it hadn't

387
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,019
been if it hadn't been all those things

388
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:42,330
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> telephone wouldn't have been a</font>

389
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:46,260
transformational technology and by the

390
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:48,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">way it took 40 years from the</font>

391
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,399
introduction of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> telephone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to like</font>

392
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,408
more than forty percent of Americans

393
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:54,750
actually had one<font color="#E5E5E5"> in their house when you</font>

394
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:57,480
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at smartphones it took seven years</font>

395
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,220
from introduction<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like sixty percent</font>

396
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,590
adoption in like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was like</font>

397
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,419
ninety percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dobson's so the way this</font>

398
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,189
transformational technology rolled out

399
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,559
was also in a different time frame but

400
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:11,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember the foundation of this was</font>

401
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:12,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">safety security and Trust that's what</font>

402
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:14,669
made the telephone a success that's what

403
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:17,970
allowed it to transform and that's why

404
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:21,510
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security in the Internet so how</font>

405
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:27,600
do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go from this world of fear pain</font>

406
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:28,980
loss to the happy internet right the

407
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,779
happy internet we're all connected

408
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody's doing everything they want</font>

409
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:34,230
to do on the Internet we're all you know

410
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,360
we're chatting we're texting we're

411
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,279
posting we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> making him sending emails</font>

412
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,419
we're doing work we're connecting with

413
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:41,040
families we're connecting with

414
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,360
we've never met across the globe we're

415
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,990
creating communities we're doing all

416
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:48,979
those great things how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get there</font>

417
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:53,730
we create a culture of cyber security

418
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:55,290
right a culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cyber security what</font>

419
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:58,170
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean a culture of cyber</font>

420
00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:00,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">security it means that you can move</font>

421
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,980
through the world doing all the things

422
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,030
you need to do to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> safe and secure</font>

423
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:08,540
online and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody learns how to</font>

424
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:11,850
use this technology safely and securely

425
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:14,040
that's what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do so let's look</font>

426
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:19,110
at a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of transformations that</font>

427
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:23,610
we've made right so we used to be a

428
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:27,149
garbage society right people got stuff

429
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:29,909
they used it they toss it in a can right

430
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,440
maybe it piled up on the street side we

431
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,930
all remember maybe some of us are old

432
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,660
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember how big litter was as</font>

433
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:38,490
an issue back into the day right maybe

434
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,230
some of you you know no you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd</font>

435
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,790
go by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the road there'd be cans there be</font>

436
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:45,000
bottles there'd be garbage everywhere

437
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:49,530
cities were disgustingly dirty but we've

438
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,960
moved right from a garbage society we're

439
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:55,139
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> path to a recycling society now</font>

440
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,750
are we there yet I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so are we</font>

441
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:00,090
closer than we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely i mean</font>

442
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,220
you know think of it think can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

443
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:05,010
of the time that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were in a place</font>

444
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,720
that didn't separate at some well some

445
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,610
level the garbage<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you were</font>

446
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,620
generating in that space whether it's a

447
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:13,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">hotel room a conference room your office</font>

448
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:15,330
right so we're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to that</font>

449
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:19,439
whether it's at home you have to

450
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:22,500
separate the things we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

451
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,860
smoking society we had a smoking culture

452
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,270
right you could smoke anywhere anywhere

453
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,760
you want to smoke there was no rules

454
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:32,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">about smoking right you could smoke</font>

455
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,590
anywhere and it was perfectly accepted

456
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:36,659
as a normative behavior is smoking

457
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:39,360
currently a normative behavior are you

458
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,980
on the right are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you normal if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you smoke</font>

459
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,169
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ABNA i want to say you're abnormal if</font>

460
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,980
you smoke but really generally you know

461
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:48,390
it's agreed upon that smoking is not the

462
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,980
social behavior that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

463
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:53,330
encourage

464
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:55,610
are we a non-smoking society yet not yet

465
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:57,350
right even here<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Las Vegas I think</font>

466
00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:00,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">there may be some casinos</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that don't</font>

467
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:02,270
allow smoking some still do you know we

468
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,740
still have cigarette smoking available

469
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,750
it's been pushed to the side in many

470
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:09,110
places but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're moving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font>

471
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:11,780
direction how long did it take to<font color="#CCCCCC"> move</font>

472
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:16,189
in this direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> this did not happen</font>

473
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:18,530
overnight right moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> from us to a</font>

474
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:21,530
recycling society<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving to a</font>

475
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:26,480
non-smoking society takes a whole bit of

476
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:28,850
time so how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> move from the panic of</font>

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet right and this really</font>

00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:48,169
my password right we call that arm

486
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:51,350
effort is stop think connect right we

487
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:53,630
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at stop think connect as</font>

488
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:56,480
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that universal message for</font>

safety on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet we have stop drop</font>

490
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,120
and roll for fire safety stop look and

491
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,220
listen for railroad crossings stop drop

492
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,320
and take cover if you're from California

493
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:09,590
or from earthquake country this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">is an uber message</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk about a</font>

say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that very simply it represents this</font>

499
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:24,230
stop make sure you've taken security

500
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:26,959
precautions like upgrading your software

501
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:29,360
like strong passwords or multi-factor

502
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,880
authentication like patching all your

503
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,350
systems right think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

504
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,049
consequences of your actions and

505
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:39,199
behaviors online remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much of</font>

506
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:41,600
security is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only technical not only</font>

507
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,630
its behavioral it's what people actually

508
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,730
do right it's what they post it's what

509
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:49,010
they share it's the kinds of things that

510
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:51,169
they do online and then the Kinect piece

511
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:54,110
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really simple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's back to that</font>

512
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:56,299
thought of connect and enjoy the

513
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:57,979
internet and enable yourselves to do the

514
00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:00,379
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do online</font>

00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">Connect is all about I will tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

did consumer based research we went out

a whole bunch of messages excuse me we

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,480
talk a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a second about how you</font>

530
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:42,260
can join this but it's currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

used<font color="#E5E5E5"> by more than 600 partners in 20</font>

different countries across the globe

533
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:48,410
this is becoming the message this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

534
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:50,750
becoming the look both ways before

535
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:54,620
crossing of security and that's really

536
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:57,799
what we intended it to be so thank you

537
00:23:54,620 --> 00:24:01,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> water really appreciate that try</font>

00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:01,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">not to spill it on the computer up here</font>

539
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,480
so I'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about more and</font>

540
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,870
stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> think connect but since</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

541
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,179
invited here by pair<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk a</font>

542
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot about passwords as an example around</font>

543
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:14,900
messaging that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at right</font>

544
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think Lori did an amazing job talking</font>

545
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">about some of the issues and she raised</font>

546
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,160
some of the ones that I think I'm going

547
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:21,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about a little bit as well but I</font>

548
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,690
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's important to look at so where</font>

549
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:25,520
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go from here I mean passwords even</font>

550
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,840
though a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stand up and say</font>

551
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,270
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kill the password dead</font>

552
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,799
right it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> dead yet I don't think</font>

553
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,679
it's going to be dead for a while and

554
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,990
it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be critical right</font>

555
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:38,120
user that role of users in developing

556
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,590
passwords is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go away we're</font>

557
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,689
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to start assigning passwords</font>

558
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:45,110
to people at any time soon so we're

559
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,790
counting on them to know what to do and

560
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,939
to do it well right that's still a

561
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:52,100
really important part of passwords and

562
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:55,370
here's the good news it can't get much

563
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:58,730
worse than<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we are today right we</font>

564
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:02,570
still know that password 1 2 3 or 1 2 3

565
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:05,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">4 5 6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 8 or password 123 or I love you</font>

566
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:07,460
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Laurie pointed out or last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year I</font>

567
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,280
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> monkey was on the list are still</font>

568
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:12,670
the most popular pass

569
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:17,980
words so the bar is very low for

570
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:20,380
progress but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to make progress so</font>

571
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:23,350
why aren't we failed in passwords what's

572
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:25,000
gone wrong right so first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all the</font>

573
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,310
long and strong passwords that we tell

574
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,570
people to do are not designed for people

575
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:30,700
with numerous accounts we all know that

576
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,620
right too many too many<font color="#E5E5E5"> accounts too</font>

577
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,930
many passwords too many unique passwords

578
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:38,110
we are human<font color="#CCCCCC"> beings we are incapable of</font>

579
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:40,570
good memory just you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know just as Laurie</font>

580
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:42,850
showed right there's inconsistency in

581
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:45,040
what sites deem a strong password right

582
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:47,889
we as the community have not

583
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:51,570
communicated clearly back out to our

584
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:54,970
users what is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good password and</font>

585
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:56,740
different sites use different ways for

586
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:59,680
determining what a strong password is

587
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:01,660
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> already you lost me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at different</font>

588
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,090
sites if I'm a user and I have to have a

589
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">different framework for making a strong</font>

590
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:08,889
password on every single site I go to

591
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,719
very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult for me there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are too</font>

592
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:14,110
many messages about passwords and I'll

593
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:18,190
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this in a second advice is</font>

594
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:20,050
often technical right right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see</font>

595
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,340
people go blog how to make a strong

596
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,930
password and you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this</font>

597
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,060
technical advice about how to do it do

598
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,770
this do that add this at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that very very</font>

599
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:29,860
technical people do not like technical

600
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:31,300
advice when we did the stop think

601
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,740
connect research one of the strongest

602
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,570
things that came back when we asked

603
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:37,000
people what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about being safe</font>

604
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:40,929
and sign they said give me common-sense

605
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,820
advice that's in my control that I can

606
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:45,730
do and I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more secure online and</font>

607
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:49,530
I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you we don't even have</font>

608
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:52,390
agreement on what makes a good password

609
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:53,950
right we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't agree on this some people</font>

610
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">say you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have numbers and</font>

611
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:57,190
symbols some people say it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

612
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:59,320
be long some people you say you have to

613
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:02,050
have capital letters we are not

614
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,360
communicating clearly to people what

615
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:05,800
makes a good password we all have ideas

616
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,090
about what make good passwords as

617
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,040
security people we all have our own

618
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,750
notions we have some research which

619
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,280
shows one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the other but even</font>

620
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,270
doing a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> test that Lori did you</font>

621
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,370
could see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some disagreement</font>

622
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:18,430
in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what makes a good</font>

623
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:20,530
password so we as the messengers and we

624
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,480
are the messengers on this issue need to

625
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:26,000
look at that

626
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:29,610
in greater depth the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

627
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,049
when we create messaging often young

628
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:32,820
people will say I have the perfect

629
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:35,190
system for creating a strong password

630
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:38,250
how many of you have your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own system for</font>

631
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:40,169
creating a strong password a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us</font>

632
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:42,350
right how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you been asked to</font>

633
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:45,360
share that system<font color="#E5E5E5"> with other people</font>

634
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:48,809
right how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those other people</font>

635
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">could actually use your system see some</font>

636
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:52,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">people believe that but I'm telling you</font>

637
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,970
for every you can't have nine million

638
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,799
systems for creating a strong password

639
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:58,169
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much to educate people on</font>

640
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,850
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is an issue right about</font>

641
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:01,830
how we educate a nice I see this all

642
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,959
time you go look there are tons of blog

643
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:05,879
postings about I have the perfect system

644
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,130
for creating a strong password and when

645
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,429
you read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll realize that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no one</font>

646
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:13,740
else could do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you so good for you</font>

647
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:15,090
right but maybe not transferable to

648
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,620
everybody else and that's been part of

649
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the issues on the password piece oh</font>

650
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:23,520
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got a little cut off here but</font>

651
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,470
this is saw this is sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> making some</font>

652
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,850
this is looking at some messaging so

653
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:30,330
here's the way we've changed our

654
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:34,049
messaging a little bit right make a

655
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:37,290
better password not<font color="#CCCCCC"> as long used to be</font>

656
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:39,929
long strong and unique right make a

657
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:42,330
better password I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guarantee you not a</font>

658
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:45,330
hundred percent but if you start asking

659
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:48,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">people they will tell you they know that</font>

660
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:50,730
their passwords no good right you don't

661
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:52,620
have to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> them because they know if</font>

662
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,750
you ask them is your password any good

663
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,879
they'll probably say it's not so make a

664
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,830
better password just<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it better</font>

665
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,840
whatever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to tell them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

666
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:02,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">it better make it a little longer make</font>

667
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,470
it something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that but don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

668
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,939
say every you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you say every</font>

669
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:08,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">account after long strunk just make a</font>

670
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,650
better password tell get people to rest

671
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:12,510
on their own sword ask them how good are

672
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,919
your passwords right they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

673
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,200
tell you they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very good okay</font>

674
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,610
let's make<font color="#E5E5E5"> them better right I think</font>

675
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,620
Laurie released this was her present you

676
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:20,610
know only change them really this is

677
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,139
important if you want them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

678
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:24,209
long if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a strong</font>

679
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,650
password only get them to change it when

680
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:27,990
it's absolutely necessary i think is

681
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:30,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">really helps them remember it under you</font>

682
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:33,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it encourages them to do a better</font>

683
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,540
job I we totally agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that start</font>

684
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,860
by focusing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> cork</font>

685
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,990
it's one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issues in messaging</font>

686
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,310
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords is that we say you've</font>

687
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">got to have long strong and unique</font>

688
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:45,159
passwords right well people could have

689
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:48,160
20 30 40 50 60 different accounts right

690
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:50,050
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is it you</font>

691
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,060
know insecurity we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about you</font>

692
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:53,440
know protecting the core right getting

693
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,389
around you know building up layers

694
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,970
what's the most important account you

695
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:59,920
have right for me when we talk about

696
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">this in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the media and people to ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

697
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,400
about this question I say the most

698
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,960
important count you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have is your email</font>

699
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">account and that should be the that</font>

700
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,180
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> account with the most</font>

701
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:11,500
strongest entry access as possible the

702
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,780
strongest way to get it why is that

703
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,400
pretty simple right if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can get in your</font>

704
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,750
email account then most likely it can

705
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,820
reset your password on every other

706
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:20,560
account that you have so even more

707
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,389
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some ways in your financial</font>

708
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,409
account and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also your bank's probably</font>

709
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:25,090
doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more on the backend</font>

710
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:26,860
authentication to make sure it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

711
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:29,199
you any way to start out<font color="#CCCCCC"> with but those</font>

712
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:31,689
core accounts we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus people</font>

713
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,370
on the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are common sense that</font>

714
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:36,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">are in their control and that they can</font>

715
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:38,350
do really important and encourage the

716
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,360
use of tools where appropriate well at

717
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:42,070
NCSA we don't promote tools we don't

718
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,330
recommend tools but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are obviously</font>

719
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:45,879
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of tools out there around</font>

00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">passwords and account access that can be</font>

721
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,380
used we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly very much in favor</font>

722
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,730
of using other things beyond the

723
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,590
password we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really</font>

724
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:55,660
important right now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working with</font>

00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:57,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the White House and in industry about</font>

developing a campaign that comes out of

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security national action plan</font>

728
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,920
from the president about developing a

00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,770
campaign about educating people about

730
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,180
stronger authentication and the many

731
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:10,750
many different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways that it will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know people</font>

733
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to also get ready to use those</font>

734
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,840
tools they're not necessarily widely

735
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:19,510
available and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saying that just</font>

736
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,070
because a service doesn't use some form

737
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,680
of stronger authentication that that

738
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:25,899
it's not secure right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

739
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,790
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way the world is moving so</font>

740
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:32,290
that's some messaging that we can think

741
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:33,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">about and then let me just talk about</font>
