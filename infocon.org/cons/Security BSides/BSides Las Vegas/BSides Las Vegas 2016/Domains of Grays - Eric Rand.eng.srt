00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:08,030
good morning everyone happy to see that

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:11,700
at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of you are here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ah so yeah</font>

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:16,049
domains of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Grey's just a really bad pun</font>

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:19,619
you don't want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know why so Who am I I</font>

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:22,800
am the complete insane person who came

6
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:25,310
up with this basic concept Nick here is

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,980
the guy who actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> made it usable</font>

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:30,598
couldn't it dump with Adam I Nick his in

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,250
the program<font color="#CCCCCC"> but he didn't submit his bio</font>

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,410
until like two weeks after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the programs</font>

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,719
would printed or something so they can

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:42,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to introduce yourself at all no</font>

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:44,460
you're good<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so the basic concept</font>

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,610
here that we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with is your</font>

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,379
standard phishing attack so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure if</font>

16
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,390
any one of you opens up your<font color="#E5E5E5"> email right</font>

17
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,410
now you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> something trying this</font>

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:58,140
this is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> common you have your basic</font>

19
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,269
idea where someone tries to fish<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,800
they include a link hey you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

21
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,769
reset your account information or

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,280
whatever some pretext in order to get

23
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:10,110
you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to their website and fill in</font>

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,890
the information that they want to steal

25
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:17,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">from you this is incredibly incredibly</font>

26
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,189
incredibly common and really it's been

27
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,790
endemic for years and years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and years</font>

28
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:26,729
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure that everyone knows or</font>

29
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,189
knows of someone who's been victimized

30
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:35,430
by this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of attack this</font>

31
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:37,289
is the this is the bog standard vaguely

32
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,619
social engineering vaguely technical

33
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:44,640
attack and quite frankly it pisses me

34
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:46,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just because there's no reason why</font>

35
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,020
they should still be working it's

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,310
incredibly obvious if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take the time</font>

37
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:56,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look but unfortunately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most users</font>

38
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,700
don't take the time to look the problem

39
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,659
here is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a training is really</font>

40
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,130
ineffective most of the time I'm sure

00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:09,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that any one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you who have worked in</font>

00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:15,810
familiar with the information security

44
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,710
that tells you to evaluate emails and

45
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:22,620
not just blindly fill things out but

46
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:27,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately well it just doesn't</font>

47
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:36,209
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way now this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is your slide</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">no fine fine he's shy so small and</font>

49
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,209
medium businesses are really heavily

50
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,180
affected by this that the large

enterprises large corpse they tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

52
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,200
have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources to at least mitigate</font>

this or people to clean up after<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,869
happens to them small medium businesses

55
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,420
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have the budget for</font>

continual training remedial training

57
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,730
remedial remedial training how many

58
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:03,840
layers deep do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font>

59
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:07,738
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah it's it's just it's horrible it</font>

60
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,690
fishing keeps working and all your red

61
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,470
teamers out there you know this very

62
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,600
well and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems like nine tenths of</font>

63
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time when you hear someone who's red</font>

64
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,060
teaming talking about what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did to</font>

65
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:24,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">get into a given</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network it starts with</font>

66
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,970
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I fished them and then it's the</font>

67
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:29,670
Gateway it's it's your gateway hack

68
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,830
except it's not really a hack as it it's

69
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:36,559
just social engineering obscured

70
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:43,860
slightly by a little Network happiness

71
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:49,350
so ultimately fishing keeps working like

72
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:51,329
I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> this pisses me off so let's let's</font>

73
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:55,380
take a look at some of the existing ways

74
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:57,769
that we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to counter fishing is that</font>

75
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,769
one's<font color="#CCCCCC"> yours</font>

76
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:09,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright some of the usual ways we do it</font>

77
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:14,700
is male hetero rights we can call out

78
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:16,589
emails as they come in but yeah we

79
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,190
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect people to notice that</font>

80
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:23,840
and do something about it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> often</font>

81
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:27,860
times they don't we have spam filters

82
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,929
which they partly mitigated but

83
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,190
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially in SMB if you're</font>

84
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:36,110
actually running your own spam filter

85
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,920
like it is not the best of situations

86
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:42,560
you're still getting at these coming

87
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:46,260
through we have blacklisting which is

88
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,690
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most part unaffordable for small</font>

89
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:55,469
businesses it's not the easiest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to</font>

90
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:56,690
get running it takes a while yeah and if

91
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,670
you don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what's coming</font>

92
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:02,940
blacklisting doesn't help and then we

93
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:06,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">have white listing which also hurts it</font>

94
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:11,520
really hurts because who do you know

95
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:13,170
you're talking to until you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

96
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,640
you ever want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to someone other</font>

97
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,230
than your current customers white

98
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,710
listing is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to do much</font>

99
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:23,780
for you yeah so most businesses want to

100
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:26,940
expand at least a little bit hopefully

101
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:31,080
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of the common reactions</font>

102
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:33,030
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see people get frustrated it's</font>

103
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,640
it's inevitable that people really

104
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,729
really hate how often fishing works and

105
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,260
the time between when you notice even a

106
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,110
good systems administrator when they

107
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,659
notice that fishing is coming in they

108
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:49,770
end up having to race to block their own

109
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:51,810
people's access to it and it it's

110
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,310
obvious that this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a problem</font>

111
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,610
for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> company other people are</font>

112
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:59,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting hurt by this and you know I I'm</font>

113
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:01,440
dedicated blue team here yes I am the

114
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,580
sworn enemy of all your red team people

115
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,260
even if I do like you socially but

116
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,630
ultimately this there's a very deep

117
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">level of frustration on the defensive</font>

118
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,590
side

119
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,930
because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just keeps happening it's</font>

120
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:18,359
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep happening it takes way too</font>

121
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,980
long to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get them taken down even if it's</font>

122
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,340
only a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours before they're taken</font>

123
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:25,440
down that's too long people take only a

124
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:29,369
couple seconds to click and start

125
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:34,500
entering information that's harm we want

126
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:37,680
to minimize that so let's let's analyze

127
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,410
how these these fishing campaigns work a

128
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:45,240
little bit let's take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good solid look</font>

129
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:49,740
at what kind of system they use what did

130
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:53,040
they depend on to do their work so we

131
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:56,280
have logistical requirements a fishing

132
00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:00,930
can't happen without some kind of server

133
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,640
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the victim to get to it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> usually a</font>

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:06,150
website it may be co-opted

00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:09,680

137
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,900
someone's DC forum or whatever that's

138
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,900
been compromised or they may well just

139
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,859
rent a VPS in Estonia or Latvia or some

140
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,620
other place that<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't have</font>

extradition with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the u.s. bulletproof</font>

143
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:34,530
of places you can put this but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

144
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:36,980
time and effort to acquire it and you

145
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:40,049
need some kind of means of running it

146
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:43,110
because as much as as much as these guys

147
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:45,810
around the attack this kind of basic

148
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:48,330
infrastructure makes them kind of

149
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:51,960
defensive to be well it gives us a way

150
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:56,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">to attack them you can have them taken</font>

151
00:07:51,960 --> 00:08:03,330
down by legal means or you can have the

152
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:06,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">AAS blacklisted for routing purposes all</font>

153
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:09,479
sorts of good things you can do but

154
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,789
ultimately the challenge here is to

155
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out there in different they're</font>

156
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,770
not in this just for the lulz usually

157
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:19,200
they're in this to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make money the</font>

158
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:22,008
credentials<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're harvesting gets sold</font>

159
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:25,938
or used elsewhere and in some fashion

160
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:29,479
that is profitable to them so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

161
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:31,490
make their expenses go up and if we can

162
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:36,139
make their profits go down as a result

163
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:40,329
this harms their business so keep that

164
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:44,449
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind a little bit like the drug says</font>

165
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:47,199
attackers have budgets to that's that's

166
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:52,839
a real key concept to keep in mind here

167
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:55,670
so how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you get a fish that</font>

168
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,949
your user ends up actually getting to

169
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:01,099
them so the fish has to hit your mail

170
00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:06,859
server which spam filtering does help

171
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:08,660
somewhat here ah and the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to go</font>

172
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:12,769
and click on the link even though we

173
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:15,260
tell them not to they still<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it so</font>

174
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:18,260
when the user clicks on the link what

175
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:20,660
happens here the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> browser opens up it</font>

176
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:24,439
fills in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information from the link</font>

177
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:28,360
it fetches<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS finds the server goes out</font>

178
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:32,600
there hey wait a second here it fetches

179
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:38,569
DNS your users workstation has to

180
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:42,110
resolve the attackers domain that is

181
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:45,529
something you control and this is why

182
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:47,800
password managers for instance password

183
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:50,329
managers don't get fooled by<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

184
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,779
because your typical password manager

185
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:56,239
here is something that is it's

186
00:09:53,779 --> 00:10:00,040
relatively simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> it looks at the</font>

187
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,199
specific page that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to and</font>

188
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:08,540
it looks at its database and says okay I

189
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:13,250
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this credential entry associated</font>

190
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:15,889
with this particular page so in this

191
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:19,579
particular case it's not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

192
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:23,240
fooled now it may look just like your

193
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:25,638
bank's website it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> look exactly pixel</font>

194
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,990
perfect they may even have not put in a

195
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:33,620
typo but if the domain isn't the same

196
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:36,639
you're fishing is not going to work on a

197
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,639
password manager

198
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:44,790
so the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> here though I would love</font>

199
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:46,769
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have absolutely everyone run password</font>

200
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,519
managers it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> beautiful thing it</font>

201
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:52,170
solves so many problems but

202
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,930
unfortunately there's a lot of distrust

203
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:57,389
of them there is a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are</font>

204
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:03,599
very very deeply suspicious especially

205
00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:06,029
of the the cloud based ones that they

206
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,579
consider that to be an unacceptable risk

207
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:11,220
to them now<font color="#E5E5E5"> personally I'm of a mind</font>

208
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:13,620
that the risk that they ameliorate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

209
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,689
risk that they solve is orders of

210
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,310
magnitude larger than the risk from any

211
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:19,889
individual password manager getting

212
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:23,069
breached but that's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> argument for</font>

213
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:25,230
another time and what's worse though is

214
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:28,310
there's a lot of folks out there banks

215
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:31,529
especially are notorious for this who

216
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:35,040
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there that they do their level</font>

217
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:37,319
best to try and mess with us they they

218
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,559
throw in stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript to block</font>

219
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:43,800
pasting or if you pay something they'll

220
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:46,290
just immediately delete it and it's if

221
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,930
you if you call them out on this if you

222
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,370
say hey guys you're blocking password

223
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:54,388
managers they're like yes but it's for

224
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:56,790
security reasons for security reasons

225
00:11:54,389 --> 00:12:02,129
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> they block the thing that keeps</font>

226
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:06,990
people secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the problem here</font>

227
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:12,389
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can't go and control them I can't</font>

228
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:15,569
control my bank deciding me for security

229
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:19,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">reasons will just block</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pasting can't do</font>

230
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:23,219
that but

231
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:27,120
what we can control is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS on our</font>

232
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,890
end and that's something that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

233
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,360
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> in more depth a little bit</font>

234
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:35,100
later but the thing to remember is there

235
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,460
are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can control there are</font>

236
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">things you can't and if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really want</font>

237
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be effective</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to focus on</font>

238
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:49,610
those that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can now a little</font>

239
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:52,080
background here I love black lists I

240
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:55,590
really love black less black<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists or my</font>

241
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,850
friend and if you follow me on the

242
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,190
twitters or something you'll see me

243
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:03,090
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the time how DNS</font>

244
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:07,650
blacklisting is a really great adblock

245
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:09,480
measure just because all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> add</font>

246
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:12,780
domains they're really reasonably well

247
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,430
known and if you want to get rid of

248
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:17,640
these ads if you want to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> them from</font>

interestingly enough causes some anti ed

blocking scripts to get upset but

254
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:41,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately blacklisting is reactive</font>

255

it's expensive to do it's expensive

computationally in some cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it</font>

just doesn't work until you know that

00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:56,189
the threat is there but an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

259
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:58,740
thing about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular threat early</font>

260
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:02,880
in the 20th century back around 2002

261
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:05,700
2003 fishing domains and other related

262
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:12,030
scam domains<font color="#E5E5E5"> they tended</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be live for</font>

263
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:14,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">about a week we've done a lot towards</font>

264
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:19,860
getting those taken down in the past 15

265
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:22,620
years and as such these days most of

266
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:28,080
these fishing domains only live as of

267
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:30,270
2014 4 24 hours so this gets to the

268
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,910
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we can practically do</font>

269
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,180
something we've narrowed the window<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

there

271
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:39,959
allowed to operate in and now let's

272
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:44,760
narrow it a little bit further fishing

273
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:48,090
is very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> a short con they are in it</font>

274
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:51,530
to win it yes but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> only have a</font>

everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is trying to get rid of these</font>

277

guys and they know it and they have

<font color="#CCCCCC">adapted they move faster the whole move</font>

279
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:04,830
fast and break things thing works really

280
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:08,010
great for these guys because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that</font>

infiltrate and and schmooze and

284
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:18,180
eventually run off with the whole casino

keeping in mind the very short window of

00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:57,930

298
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:08,069
if you can control your DNS and if you

299
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:12,210
can keep things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are suspicious from</font>

300
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:17,550
resolving long enough and fishing stops

301
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:20,010
working if the if their page gets taken

302
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:23,189
down or abandoned or otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> left off</font>

303
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:25,410
after that 24 hours and you've delayed

304
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:30,930
resolution on your network for that 24

305
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:34,130
hours fishing no longer works this is a

306
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:39,120
way to block their window<font color="#CCCCCC"> of opportunity</font>

307
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:40,390
they can't work with that so and Europe

308
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,480
next year

309
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:45,760
there are a few prerequisites you're

310
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:51,940
going to have to actually control your

311
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:54,100
infrastructure so in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network if</font>

312
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,100
you're loud and dns to resolve just

313
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,650
straight through to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet it's</font>

314
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,180
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the best thing what we did</font>

315
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">is we wrote a small program that sits</font>

316
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:09,490
there in between<font color="#E5E5E5"> your actual dns</font>

317
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:13,839
resolver and looks at the time window

318
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:16,569
when things were requested basically you

319
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:22,300
want everything to go through it it's

320
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:25,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably the easiest way just egress</font>

321
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:30,610
filtering to what's it egress filtering

322
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:34,050
yeah 53 needs to be filtered out bound

323
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:36,909
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can't let things just</font>

324
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:40,870
hang out going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet by</font>

325
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:43,660
themselves funny little anecdote a

326
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:45,300
particular client I was working with had

327
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,620
not yet implemented egress filtering

328
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:50,169
they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that their sprinkler</font>

329
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:55,209
controller was requesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS from</font>

330
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:57,720
Russia so that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not usually what</font>

331
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,890
you want for a sprinkler controller

332
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:07,480
unless it's know that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> heavy sure</font>

333
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:09,550
noble water yeah anyway stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> on network</font>

334
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:14,050
controls you want to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gray</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lister</font>

335
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:16,510
in front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your DNS you really want to</font>

336
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:18,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure everything resolves through</font>

337
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,750
that

338
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:26,950
this is definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a proof of concept</font>

339
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:31,929
yeah I would not run in production yet

340
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:34,900
but uh yeah we have a proof concept that

341
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:38,140
runs great listing with blacklisting

342
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:41,410
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> by listing support basically</font>

343
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:45,160
what we've done is we you point your dns

344
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:47,230
resolution to it and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't know</font>

345
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:51,580
what it is we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to point</font>

346
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:54,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">that i guess a predefined 9p yeah you</font>

347
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">can configure it we're defaulting to</font>

348
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,419
local house just because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

349
00:18:55,809 --> 00:19:01,750
stupidest and laziest way to do it but

350
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:03,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you have for instance some kind of</font>

351
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:07,630
internal infrastructure that you would

352
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:10,390
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use in cases where you'd like</font>

353
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:12,309
for instance to interface with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

354
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:14,650
desk or what have you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could easily</font>

355
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:16,389
point it to a local server on which you

356
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,850
have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of landing page</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that will</font>

357
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:21,900
accept whatever and say hey this<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

358
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:27,879
been great listed talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your help desk</font>

359
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:30,070
and also let's keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind that this</font>

360
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,970
being a<font color="#E5E5E5"> proof of concept these things do</font>

361
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:35,470
evolve and change over time it is

362
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,710
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that needs extensive</font>

363
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:41,380
baselining in order to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> because as</font>

364
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:44,620
you found out what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google Authenticator</font>

365
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:46,660
had issues with it because it flips

366
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:50,620
through a whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> domains during</font>

367
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:53,559
its request process baselining it is

368
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is either you're going to</font>

369
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:58,740
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just keep on making requests</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

370
00:19:55,419 --> 00:20:01,510
if you wanted you could for instance

371
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:05,679
throw a spanner a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mirror port off of</font>

372
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:09,549
some local network device or just

373
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:12,070
iptables with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tee and throw your your</font>

374
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:15,460
DNS traffic over to it for a day or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

375
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:17,678
before you actually put<font color="#CCCCCC"> this in line</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

376
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:23,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would enable it to baseline your</font>

377
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:26,169
network into its its database further

378
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:29,550
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to want to populate the</font>

379
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:32,530
whitelist with your local domain because

380
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:33,260
the nature<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is such that we want</font>

381
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font>

382
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,430
resolve any<font color="#CCCCCC"> white listed entries</font>

383
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:39,710
immediately without having to go through

384
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:43,070
the trouble of evaluating whether we've

385
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:47,000
seen it before<font color="#CCCCCC"> so whitelist blacklist</font>

386
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:49,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">grey list whitelist your local stuff any</font>

387
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,990
people you know are good blacklist if

388
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,540
you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to see something</font>

389
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:55,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">will just reject it great listing oh</font>

390
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:59,020
that's where we're doing other fun

391
00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:01,910
things yep yeah basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you can</font>

392
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:03,290
monitor your stuff and put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in their</font>

393
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:07,390
first kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> pre warmuth then</font>

394
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:07,389
everything will run a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

395
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:15,080
we do have drawbacks though as mentioned

396
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">earlier you actually have to run</font>

397
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything through it if everybody is</font>

398
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:22,100
resolving their own<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns who knows what's</font>

399
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:25,490
going on you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one</font>

400
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:28,459
centralized point for it and yeah as

401
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:32,360
mentioned some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the single sign-on</font>

402
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:34,010
stuff sometimes breaks because they push

403
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:38,300
you through a couple different<font color="#E5E5E5"> domains</font>

404
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:41,870
to get that working but pretty warming

405
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:45,500
it allows that to be mitigated<font color="#CCCCCC"> once up</font>

406
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:47,389
should fingers crossed once all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

407
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,510
domains are populated into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> grey list</font>

408
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:53,450
and they've aged enough to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> allowed it</font>

409
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:55,850
tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work out really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well and as it</font>

410
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:59,630
happens we've set a default blackout

411
00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:02,480
date of what was 180 hours sounds about

412
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:04,190
right it is seven days essentially so if

413
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,530
you've hit it within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last seven days</font>

414
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:10,700
it continues to persist within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> grey</font>

415
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:13,220
list that's the basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> notion so if it is</font>

416
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:17,870
something you<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep using then it will</font>

417
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:20,870
stay live if you stop using it if for

418
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:22,489
instance you were associating with a

419
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:26,830
given<font color="#E5E5E5"> company that company goes out of</font>

420
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:29,180
business then after seven days or so

421
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,939
after you stop going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that company's</font>

422
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:34,640
website it stopped it falls<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the</font>

423
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:37,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">grey list which is pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> handy because</font>

424
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,730
there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been instances where</font>

425
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,990
companies have gone out of business and

426
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,960
someone else has grabbed the domain

427
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:46,640
after it expired use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> now-familiar</font>

428
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,000
domain that's probably still

429
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,280
white listed in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of places and</font>

430
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:58,310
proceeded to fish<font color="#E5E5E5"> people for all sorts</font>

431
00:22:52,280 --> 00:23:00,500
of gain it's a fun attack also<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

432
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:03,290
the greatest part that you know we

433
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,210
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing yes after 24 hours i</font>

434
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:07,129
believe by default is when we actually

435
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:11,540
resolve things right there's the initial

lovely controversy that came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently</font>

484
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:46,220
where someone went and typos squatted a

bunch of code repo domains and proceeded

486
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:51,890
to the thing that was controversial was

487
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:54,669
that he went and put a generic script in

488
00:25:51,890 --> 00:26:00,290
there that popped an error when you

489
00:25:54,669 --> 00:26:05,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">downloaded that script so typo squatting</font>

490
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:08,809
works because people people don't always

their analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ransomware delivery</font>

511
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:11,270
shows some interesting ways in which you

can control whether or not these things

513

succeed so obviously

514
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:21,870
with the malicious URL if you can't

happiness won't resolve and the attacks

not going to work likewise<font color="#E5E5E5"> if someone</font>

a few variants these days that use a

generic key but because these these

533
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:24,510
ransomware authors are lazy as well they

534
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:26,969
have shared their generic key for<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of interesting how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> second</font>

other areas that we could work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

543
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:55,530
is just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very basic a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> admittedly the is</font>

544
00:28:52,230 --> 00:29:00,600
simplistic a concept we're working with

545
00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:03,270
but the generalized approach is by

546
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:06,179
controlling your infrastructure you can

547
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:09,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">diffuse a lot of attacks you have to</font>

548
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,440
consent to<font color="#CCCCCC"> being attacked I mean if you</font>

549
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,120
never hook up your computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">network no network based attacks going</font>

551
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,820
to work but you have to do that you have

552
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:20,129
to cook up the computer to a network to

553
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:23,870
actually do business so we get

554
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:28,430
trade-offs so

555
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:33,050
if you do this kind of control you're

556
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:35,450
allowing yourself to dictate to the

557
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:40,370
attacker under what conditions they are

558
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:43,059
allowed to engage and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there that is</font>

559
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:45,860
is a very strong defensive measure

560
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:47,690
because now the attacker has to put a

561
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:51,199
lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and effort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into attacking</font>

562
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:54,020
you than they would otherwise they can't

563
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,780
use the low bars they can't use the

564
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:59,450
low-hanging fruit they have to put in

565
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:02,330
extra effort and that alone dissuade

566

<font color="#E5E5E5">some of them the others who are actually</font>

567
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:07,970
dedicated to attacking you are forced to

568
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:10,760
use more sophisticated methods they'll

569
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:12,320
have to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> some way to get</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">around the gray listing on your end</font>

there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a couple of obvious things</font>

572
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,770
some of which we are addressing naked

573
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:21,230
eye peas for instance you're going to

574
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:23,870
have to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you've got squid or</font>

575
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:26,330
something filtering those out there's a

576
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:32,229
fun little regular expression<font color="#E5E5E5"> the horror</font>

577
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:35,330
thing that allows you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that but</font>

578
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:37,910
dictating the pace of the attack means

579
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:40,129

<font color="#E5E5E5">the attack you can take more measures</font>

581
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:45,910
and something which I didn't include on

582
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:50,059
the slides but is definitely in there

583
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:52,960
logging we have the provision to write

584
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:56,420
logs that tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on if</font>

585
00:30:52,960 --> 00:31:00,200
you see in your logs a whole bunch of

586
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:02,570
initial<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray listed attempts by a whole</font>

588
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:07,669
know something's weird if you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

591
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:16,460
hitting a great listed entry it is

592
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">highly likely they're being fish trying</font>

593
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:21,260
to get your bank account credentials

594
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:24,140
that kind of thing likewise spearfishing

595
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:26,750
of your executives that's going to show

596
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:29,450
up in the logs so we have the logs

597
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:31,550
available and it breaks them up as to

598
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:33,860
whether or not it's a loud<font color="#CCCCCC"> grey list of</font>

601
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,760
visibility into what's going on in to

602
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,500
your network which is a lovely tool I

603
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,330
don't know if you've ever tried to

604
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:49,650
analyze dns logs from Active Directory

605
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:52,230
before but it's not very easy it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

606
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:57,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of time and effort and its really</font>

607
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:58,530
annoying so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess I've been</font>

608
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">speaking a little quickly because we're</font>

609
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:08,280
all ready to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the payoff here's a repo</font>

610
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:10,379
here's a tool for you I it's very

611
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,050
differently proof of concept and we

612
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:15,720
would like a whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback we</font>

613
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:19,110
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to try this out on their</font>

614
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:22,020
networks we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see how well this</font>

615
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:23,879
performs in real life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you want to</font>

616
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:26,700
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> us some contributions to make this</font>

617
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:31,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">work better please I'm a terrible coder</font>

618
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:34,200
he's much better than I am definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

619
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:37,770
fix it up as much as I could so he took

620
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,780
my horrible nasty awful frankly awful

621
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:42,120
proof of concept and and made it into

622
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:47,399
something vaguely acceptable sorry for

623
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:49,739
the handicapped and we would really like

624
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:52,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see this go out into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the world where</font>

625
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:55,770
it's open source feel free<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take it</font>

626
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:58,770
and use it as you will I feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

627
00:32:55,770 --> 00:33:00,570
adapt it to other things personally I

628
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:03,980
would like to see integrated into

629
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:06,810
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like pfsense or other similar</font>

630
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:08,190
distributions of that sort because it

631
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:12,570
would work well within that kind of

632
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:14,460
sweet and if you have any<font color="#CCCCCC"> suggestions on</font>

633
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:17,610
how to improve<font color="#E5E5E5"> this how to make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

634
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:20,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">better I am all ears I am more than</font>

635
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:23,159
happy to take your contributions to take

636
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:25,200
your criticism to take any suggestions

637
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,760
and see what we can do about making this

638
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,720
better I'm actually just curious what

639
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,900
happens when are you running it on a

640
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">foal yeah we'd like to see bigger net</font>

641
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:35,610
when either of us has a real big<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

642
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,950
to play with so seeing how well this

643
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:40,439
scales is going to be an interesting

644
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:43,260
interesting challenge so there's your

645
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:47,240
basic concept and if any of you have any

646
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:47,240
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd love to hear him</font>

647
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:59,189
latency so that's that's a killer

648
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,610
question right there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I met a little bit</font>

649
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:04,710
and it's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much the resolution of</font>

650
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:07,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">the one machine and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then the next one so</font>

651
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:11,429
if you're doing resolv.conf which is the

652
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:14,239
default I think it's late it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever</font>

653
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:16,409
pretty much your network latency is

654
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:19,379
basically doubled because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

655
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:20,970
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and try and grab the next next</font>

656
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:24,060
response so it's more in the order of

657
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:25,290
milliseconds than minutes yeah well I

658
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,899
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's great list and it's going</font>

659
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:32,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be morally well yes if it's great</font>

660
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:35,668
list it's going to be a day but ok so

661
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:38,069
for some networks blocking dns on my

662
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:40,469
break a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff so what about the</font>

663
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:42,780
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of using dns master</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

664
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:48,020
transparent dms proxy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> filter all the</font>

665
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:52,679
requests through the rails that is so

666
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:55,889
this is essentially a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS proxy in and</font>

667
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:58,500
of itself it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very simplistic</font>

668
00:34:55,889 --> 00:35:01,410
one and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really more of a filter</font>

669
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:04,040
than anything else but yeah it's we're

670
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:07,290
not looking to block all dns outbound

671
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:10,200
fun waiting to do it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS mask so and</font>

672
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:18,480
Dina's<font color="#CCCCCC"> mastin let us do it so yeah</font>

673
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:23,299
here's how we're doing it leverage

674
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,300
responsible policies own fine so why

675
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:31,990
if we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in our lists then</font>

676
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,710
we're just going to result in to bind to

677
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:37,750
pretty much for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first part of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

678
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:41,170
but you've dug by the weaknesses and

679
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:45,280
stuff yeah when you talk about volume

680
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:48,160
and performance and scaling our art RBZ

681
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">we seen is a really good crutch to rely</font>

682
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,920
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> vc networks that resolved you know</font>

683
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:57,670
millions of the middle of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a shock</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

684
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:00,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">rpz might take five to ten percent it at</font>

685
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:06,100
a time<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you can have a million</font>

686
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:09,810
domains in you're blacklisted but if if

687
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:12,640
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I took a small look at that I kind of</font>

688
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:14,110
got rid of it afterwards because it

689
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:18,430
looked like it was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a blacklisting</font>

690
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:19,660
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> no yeah it didn't look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like it fit</font>

691
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:23,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem when I was doing the</font>

692
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:25,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">research so I could be wrong this could</font>

693
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">be something that a clever bind</font>

694
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:32,620
configuration could well solve but hey

695
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:35,859
let's let's try it out anyway any other

696
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:38,440
questions no well I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

698
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:45,690

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,690
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> scheduled I guess up go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead</font>

700
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:02,180
that was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not a condemnation of</font>

701
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,130
Estonia I was just looking through

702
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,509
Eastern European countries in my head

703
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:08,630
and that was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones that came</font>

704
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:20,150
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> my my my apologies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I offended the</font>

706
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:28,099
lovely country I've just never been
