00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,490
Republic I'm absolutely sure this is

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,948
going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> just as good as a talk as</font>

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,990
the one Adam was planning and this is

11
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,230
about disclosing password hashing

12
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,420
policies mashaallah had been with us

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:39,769
before a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pastor's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come up to several</font>

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,770
times and yeah take it<font color="#CCCCCC"> away</font>

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,449
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone my name is Michael or you</font>

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,340
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just call me Michael in check if</font>

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody here speaks Czech anybody here</font>

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:01:00,980
speaks Czech oh yeah my girlfriend yeah

19
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:03,739
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's enough yeah so my talk is</font>

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:07,399
about disclosing publishing policies and

21
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:10,789
by that I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know companies who</font>

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,680
are storing user passwords they probably

23
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,810
should do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them something</font>

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,520
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice not something nasty and they</font>

25
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,530
should tell us how they should tell

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,020
their users what they do to the password

27
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:24,200
so I'm going to talk about who's doing

28
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:27,140
who already has already<font color="#E5E5E5"> done that and</font>

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,830
how they do that and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this so</font>

30
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,990
the duct<font color="#E5E5E5"> tape here is just you know if</font>

31
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,300
you don't want to disclose any<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

32
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:38,089
just put it over your mouth so that's

33
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:42,500
why it's on the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide and yeah</font>

34
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:45,830
let's go so please raise your hands with

35
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,390
seen sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a message like this when</font>

36
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,520
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to register your password</font>

37
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,050
must be<font color="#CCCCCC"> six to twenty characters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font>

38
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,880
raise your my god is everyone almost

39
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:59,149
good now one<font color="#CCCCCC"> more raising hands who has</font>

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,770
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> already wondering why please raise</font>

41
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:03,200
your hands was one was wondering why do

42
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,729
you do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool me as well of</font>

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,440
course so you're not alone<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

44
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:10,280
people also wondering why actually

45
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,930
companies are you know putting password

46
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,750
policies like it that the password must

47
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,250
be maximum 20 characters so sometimes

48
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,120
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just tweeting asking the</font>

49
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:22,490
company's why they do that like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy</font>

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,750
who I know he asked rip it like why do

51
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:29,810
they require him to have the password

52
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:32,540
exactly nine to 64 characters long so he

53
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,520
was wondering why do they do that and he

54
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,130
asked tweeted at them so people

55
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:40,550
sometimes do that most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the times they</font>

56
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:44,299
just don't get any answer companies just

57
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:46,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't reply it all well sometimes the</font>

58
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,970
reason is that just the companies don't

59
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,980
know why they do that because what

60
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,950
happened to me once when I asked that

61
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">the guy who actually set up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the rules he</font>

62
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,768
already left to come

63
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,540
honey so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> company's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what why</font>

64
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:02,780
do they limit the length of the password

65
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,819
and they try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit the information for</font>

66
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,310
me but they failed so most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the times</font>

67
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:11,030
and you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get any any answer if</font>

68
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:13,610
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask which is kinda but sometimes</font>

69
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,890
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are wondering or actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

70
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,329
are afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when the company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

71
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,609
limiting the length of the passwords

72
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:21,650
that they are storing it in in a plain

73
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,680
text in the database because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you let</font>

74
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,390
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the passwords to say 64 characters</font>

75
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,060
they are afraid the users are afraid

76
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,649
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company is limiting the length</font>

77
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,980
of the password because they are storing

78
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:36,079
the passwords in a database in a column

79
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,959
which is 64 characters wide and they

80
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:40,940
just kind of fit anymore so sometimes

81
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,859
users are afraid that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company's</font>

82
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,540
storing passwords in plain text if they

83
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:47,180
limit the length of the passwords it

84
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,560
might be true and it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not it</font>

85
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,109
actually doesn't reveal anything because

86
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,139
sometimes the rules are there for just

87
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:56,780
whatever reason but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the the</font>

88
00:03:54,139 --> 00:04:01,040
password storage so but it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be true</font>

89
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:03,049
it might not so yeah this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> his palette</font>

90
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,849
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially true when there is a</font>

91
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:07,849
password<font color="#E5E5E5"> breach or database breach or</font>

92
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:11,209
database<font color="#CCCCCC"> league in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very moment the</font>

93
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:12,619
people are more wondering actually and

94
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,799
they are asking how the company is

95
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,358
storing their passwords so if they store

96
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:20,930
it in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad way or if they store</font>

97
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:23,900
it in a secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> way this is a story from</font>

98
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:26,419
shut<font color="#E5E5E5"> both servers should bow is a is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

99
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,400
minecraft servers or he's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> company</font>

100
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:31,669
running minecraft servers and they got

101
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,440
breached I think few months ago so they

102
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:36,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">just announced it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on their forum and</font>

103
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,669
people started wondering for example

104
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,710
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this guy froze</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> J he asked what</font>

105
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:44,659
hashing algorithm was used for storing

106
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,359
the passwords because the original

107
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:50,090
announcement said only that the

108
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,460
attackers got hold of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know one way</font>

109
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">encrypted passwords nothing else so he</font>

110
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,669
was wondering what he/she<font color="#CCCCCC"> naga written</font>

111
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,669
was used for storing the passwords he

112
00:04:55,669 --> 00:05:01,760
asked on a public forum<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah so he</font>

113
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:04,070
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting answers like this</font>

114
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,248
one from<font color="#E5E5E5"> another member of the of the</font>

forum

116
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:11,499
and thanks Bruce from password research

117
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,989
coming for sending me this so I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

118
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:16,149
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my talk yeah if they told</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you that</font>

119
00:05:13,989 --> 00:05:20,429
there will be no point in the encryption

120
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:22,569
and there is a head<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bank emoji so yeah</font>

121
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:24,638
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not go into details here</font>

122
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:26,799
because you know i shink an encryption

123
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,899
something different and getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> house</font>

124
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:34,748
<font color="#E5E5E5">principal and yeah let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just let's move</font>

125
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:40,329
on well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> official answer was this one</font>

126
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:42,849
it wasn't much better<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said that don't</font>

127
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:47,379
worry the passwords were hatched and

128
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:49,269
sold it and managed professionally no

129
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:50,679
idea what does it mean they didn't

130
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:52,269
specify the algorithm but they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

131
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:54,518
<font color="#CCCCCC">the boss managed salted and hashed</font>

132
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:56,289
professional<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll publish my slides then</font>

133
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:58,749
there is a link if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to verify it</font>

134
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:03,248
and check that and comment on that maybe

135
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:05,229
I don't recommend it but yeah so luckily

136
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:08,169
there are companies who are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

137
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:10,839
afraid to completely disclose their

138
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:13,719
parcel<font color="#E5E5E5"> rushing policies I'll write the</font>

139

next slide for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> / yeah luckily there</font>

140
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:18,339
are companies were really not afraid to

141
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:21,399
disclose complete details what they are

142
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:25,229

00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:34,889
Norway which was the talk was about

146
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:37,419
facebook password hashing policies and

147
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,999
you know the opt indication and

148
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:42,639
everything so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a slide</font>

149
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:44,589
from the from his talk and this is what

150
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook does to their passwords and</font>

151
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:48,329
they do a lot of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the password</font>

152
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:50,589
but they had the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for that</font>

153
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:52,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">seriously just I recommend to watch the</font>

154
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:54,579
talk because he's talking about that

155
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:58,659
like for our own 40 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something</font>

156
00:06:54,579 --> 00:07:01,149
so yeah they use several layers of that

157
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:04,058
but at the core of it there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a script</font>

158
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:06,279
here and some of some H max here they

159
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:08,249
have reason for that so I don't like

160
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:10,419
John Ivan that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes into details</font>

161
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:12,489
seriously just what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk and but</font>

162
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:13,989
this is completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they do to the</font>

163
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:15,219
view to the user passwords and they are

164
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:18,099
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid to disclose it and they are</font>

165
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:19,510
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid to tell us there are other</font>

166
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:21,370
companies

167
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:23,740
who are not afraid to tell us what they

168
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:28,210
do to the to their passwords for example

169
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:31,780
like like LastPass they just they have

170
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:34,060
it also yeah facebook facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> did that</font>

171
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,700
in a talk so it's not somewhere on their

172
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,860
side it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> on facebook com it's just</font>

173
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:42,490
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in a talk by a security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy</font>

174
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:44,440
from facebook LastPass they they publish

175
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,820
it on their side and they say that last

176
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:51,640
part utilizes the pbk day<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

177
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:53,310
which show something else to turn your

178
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,169
master password into the encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> key</font>

179
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,240
they get more details there as well this

180
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:01,270
is just a this is just a short short

181
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,770
text copied from from from the side so

182
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not afraid to disclose how</font>

183
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,810
they have the story is a password<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

184
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,030
same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes for for one password</font>

185
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,920
they are also<font color="#E5E5E5"> not afraid to tell us what</font>

186
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:15,729
they do to the user passwords they have

187
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,470
released 60 pages long PDF which

188
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:20,020
completely describes a security design

189
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:21,580
of the one password for teams<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one</font>

190
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,770
password for families which is really

191
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,419
nice and one password is also doing a

192
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,549
really nice thing they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are sending Geoff</font>

193
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:31,590
to Las Vegas<font color="#CCCCCC"> every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time every single</font>

194
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">year I don't know why but thanks thanks</font>

195
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:38,950
yeah so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some other nice</font>

196
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,750
companies and smaller services which are

197
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,150
doing the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing they are disclosing</font>

198
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:46,870
how exactly do they store user passwords

199
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:49,030
and one nice example is Scott helmets

200
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,800
report you where I i put riddled<font color="#CCCCCC"> io</font>

201
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:53,740
which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> service which is really nice</font>

202
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,589
service for aggregating content security

203
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,330
policy reports and HTTP public key

204
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:00,460
pinning reports very nice service for

205
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,530
doing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he's got this information</font>

206
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">this input and inflammation which says</font>

207
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,310
want to know our population policies

208
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:09,610

209
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:11,709
questions so he's got this on a login

00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,350
page and on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign-up page as well right</font>

211
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:16,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">next to the to the to the field value</font>

214
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,290
these companies you know Facebook's got

215
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:25,570
a lot of private data last pass well

216
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,579
trouble as well the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing goes for</font>

217
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:30,850
this for this service they got a lot of

218
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:33,100
a lot of reports or from Conan security

219
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,670
policies so they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not afraid to</font>

220
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,840
disclose

221
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:39,849
and what the bar how do they store user

222
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,500
passwords there is more companies like

223
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,850
this and I have actually started

224
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,010
collecting them you know some people

225
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:49,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">collect you know empty beer cans and</font>

226
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:53,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuffs like this so I collect sides this</font>

227
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,810
is my<font color="#E5E5E5"> side I call it you know my college</font>

228
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">packet of sees it and you can find a</font>

229
00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:02,050
link to 22 subdomain called pulls i have

230
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:06,670
several sides of the other just to just

231
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:08,290
show the side in a few seconds it's

232
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,329
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a part of the bigger</font>

233
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,890
survey of the internet that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I call</font>

234
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:16,570
it pools because I got heavily<font color="#E5E5E5"> inspired</font>

235
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:20,560
by work from 18 f which is a US

236
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:22,270
government something and they scan US

237
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,939
government websites and they just

238
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,410
publicly score how you know how good<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

239
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,300
encryption is there and everything so I

240
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:31,120
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something similar but I'm</font>

241
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,380
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single and you know one man show</font>

242
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,220
this is one man show and so it takes

243
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,990
more time but let's just move on so this

244
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">is why it's called pools because they</font>

245
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,310
call it pools as well so I got really

246
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:46,990
really heavily inspired by that the side

247
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:48,939
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this so I think I right now I</font>

248
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,800
have only 20 companies because it's not

249
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that easy to you know get official</font>

250
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,109
information how companies store

251
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:57,490
passwords but so if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the side</font>

252
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:01,180
here i have the company which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

253
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:05,140
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> doc and side ape data dog HQ</font>

254
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:06,849
dot-com and they have disclosed that

255
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,010
they use bcrypt for storing the

256
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,120
passwords so there is more such like

257
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:13,030
this some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them are checked because</font>

258
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,890
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> from czech republic so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm asking</font>

259
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,209
the companies directly and they know

260
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:19,210
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they should tell me because</font>

261
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:23,920
otherwise i'll just you know make a

262
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:26,110
public PR for them really bad so yeah

263
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,099
here are the companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sides and</font>

264
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:32,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">the algorithms they use i also came up</font>

265
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:36,550
with the rating system of how good they

266
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:39,870
are so they todoke is rated<font color="#E5E5E5"> be this</font>

267
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:44,650
company is rated f well we will learn

268
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:47,930
why so wherever<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have more details</font>

269
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:50,760
about the company or about the

270
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:52,560
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> passwords in Polish</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they use so I</font>

271
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,060
also try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the side so here i</font>

272
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,439
have a check<font color="#E5E5E5"> company which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was working</font>

273
00:11:54,060 --> 00:12:01,709
for in 2014 so we made a talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font>

274
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,260
we do every the<font color="#CCCCCC"> passwords and you can</font>

275
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:07,530
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the sores on my side that we</font>

276
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:09,569
use out the company's<font color="#E5E5E5"> bcrypt and cost is</font>

277
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:12,990
10 and they also do some encryption on

278
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:16,650
the hashes and they have disclosed it on

279
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:18,900
on a Twitter and in a talk every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

280
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:21,060
put something into this side into my

281
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,689
side it must be already<font color="#CCCCCC"> a public</font>

282
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:26,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">information I don't put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything like</font>

283
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:29,610
you know because sometimes you learn how

284
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:33,710
the companies are storing passwords just

285
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:35,790
by doing let's say penetration<font color="#E5E5E5"> test and</font>

286
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:37,530
so I don't put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there it must already</font>

287
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,390
be a public information<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody already</font>

288
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:42,449
must have disclosed it somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

289
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:45,330
talk on Twitter on Facebook or in a docs

290
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:47,100
or somewhere so every time I just put

291
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:51,090
their disclosure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> link to disclosures</font>

292
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:53,550
I also make the snapshot of the of the

293
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:55,200
of the disclosure so that if they later

294
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:57,990
a think that it was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good thing to</font>

295
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:04,080
disclose<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's still on the internet and</font>

296
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:06,420
it will stay on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet yeah so a</font>

297
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:11,220
bit about the rating system I've come up

298
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:14,939
with yeah the rating system works like

299
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,650
this if you want to score or if the

300
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,920
company wants to score<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice great</font>

301
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:22,650
in my in my rating system it needs to

302
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:28,110
use a slow heshes that means be creped I

303
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:30,090
scraped PB key thing and or argon<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I</font>

304
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:33,240
call it slow edges right now just for

305
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:35,490
the lack of better naming and if you

306
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,040
want to score<font color="#E5E5E5"> really perfect perfect</font>

307
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:40,770
great like a you also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to disclose</font>

308
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,810
that in your dogs because if you

309
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,819
disclose it somewhere in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the talk or on</font>

310
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:47,369
in a blog post or on Facebook or on

311
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,080
Twitter it's it's hidden nobody will

312
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:52,080
look at nobody will look for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it there</font>

313
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:55,170
because you know the blog post they just

314
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,000
you know disappear in time also<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

315
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,349
true for Twitter and Facebook posts so

316
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,780
if you want to score if the company

317
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:04,380
wants to score a perfect perfect great

318
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:07,260
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us you know right in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

319
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">docs because that's probably where</font>

320
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,200
everyone if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for the</font>

321
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:13,380
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's probably where you</font>

322
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to look and everyone to look at you</font>

323
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,750
will trouble not go through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blocker</font>

324
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:20,189
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook or to this so that's why</font>

325
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:23,010
some of the companies even if they use

326
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:25,080
bcrypt they have they have be they have

327
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:28,470
great be because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just tell us in a</font>

328
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:31,830
talk and not not<font color="#E5E5E5"> dead officially then</font>

329
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:34,710
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are other hashes like you know</font>

330
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:38,700
show one to show three and under I

331
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:40,740
should md5 and if the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses</font>

332
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:44,160
something like that and defy for show on

333
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:46,410
show too and they at least salt it and

334
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:51,150
stretch it and it means they do several

335
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:53,459
iterations of that they score see if

336
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:56,670
they just sold the hash they score d and

337
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:59,160
if just just use plain md5 or plain show

338
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,349
one or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that they score e</font>

339
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,760
or if they encrypt the passwords they

340
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,270
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't I should already be encrypted</font>

341
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:11,160
they just score e it could be worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

342
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:13,439
yeah it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> worse f is for fail and</font>

343
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,089
that's plain text there are some

344
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,270
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> when storing plain text as</font>

345
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:22,530
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunately so a and B are</font>

346
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:24,750
somehow safe<font color="#E5E5E5"> CDE see could be safe as</font>

347
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:28,319
well but we are not sure so these ones

348
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:35,340
are not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice and this is not nice</font>

349
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:38,610
at all so sharing is caring but some

350
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:42,810
don't care so they didn't share so is

351
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:44,310
it's okay to share<font color="#CCCCCC"> or disclose the the</font>

352
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:47,219
password hashing policy for the company

353
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:50,670
well I think yeah I think it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

354
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:53,880
especially if the company uses you know

355
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:56,370
bcrypt or a script or fun or hashing

356
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,550
functions designed to store user

357
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:01,560
passwords if they don't use functions

358
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:05,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">designed to store user passwords like md</font>

359
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,780
500 an hour show<font color="#E5E5E5"> one or something it's</font>

360
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,400
better for them to fix that to use

361
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,640
something better and then they can

362
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,590
disclose it because yeah there is no

363
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,760
point in not disclosing that if it's if

364
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,440
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook</font>

365
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,270
last bus and one pass for disclosing

366
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:22,500
what they do to the passwords<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

367
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:24,510
there's no point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in hiding that so some</font>

368
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,310
companies are afraid that if they

369
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:29,460
disclose what they do to the user

370
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,959
passwords that they will get hacked that

371
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:35,310
they will get that they will become<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

372
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:39,990
target well I have big I've been used

373
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:43,170
for them they already are a target and

374
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:46,770
i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about target the company</font>

375
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:48,569
well so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a data dog I have dated</font>

376
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,699
oak on my screen shot somewhere here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

377
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:55,140
think yet this could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they use</font>

378
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:56,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">the USB crib and they have the USB crypt</font>

379
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,030
and they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been using the Crypt even</font>

380
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:03,120
even before the data breach that has

381
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:05,280
suffered like I think a month ago so

382
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,209
they were using bcrypt and they go tact

383
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,010
as well so it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really matter how</font>

384
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:13,949
the company is storing the passwords

385
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:15,569
because companies get<font color="#CCCCCC"> hecht and they</font>

386
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,990
will get hacked even if they just use

387
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:21,060
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> they use it's it's worse if</font>

388
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,890
they use plain text<font color="#CCCCCC"> so md5 or a plane</font>

389
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,020
show one or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that but they</font>

390
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:27,630
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay you'll get hacked there is</font>

391
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">another company who got hacked even if</font>

392
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:32,790
they were using bcrypt and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

393
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,530
Ashley<font color="#CCCCCC"> medicine but I think that the the</font>

394
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:37,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">motivation for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a congressional medicine</font>

395
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:40,200
was completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> different than then user</font>

396
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,960
passwords but so even if they disclose

397
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,550
what they use they get hacked and even

398
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,080
if they don't I think that data dog

399
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:50,820
didn't disclose before they get hacked

400
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:53,399
and i still get egged so there are some

401
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:57,510
tricks for the users how they can

402
00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:00,360
actually investigate how the company is

403
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:03,120
storing the user passwords one of the

404
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:06,800
trix's is here it's it's exploiting the

405
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:10,320
PHP's feature of comparing two strings

406
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:13,430
so it works like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this if you are able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

407
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:16,860
sign up to a site with the passwords

408
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:19,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">2406 something like a bra and then you</font>

409
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:23,969
are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to login to the side with this</font>

410
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:26,640
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> q and key or something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

411
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">can be pretty sure that the company is</font>

412
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,050
using plain md5 to store these

413
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:33,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">passwords even without the company</font>

414
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:37,050
telling us well so this drinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> words</font>

415
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:40,110
like this the hash of 240 something

416
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:42,210
something is starts with 0 e and then

417
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:45,270
there are some more<font color="#E5E5E5"> writers the same</font>

418
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:48,390
thing goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> for nd5 from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Q and blah blah</font>

419
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:52,650
blah the hash is also 0 e and something

420
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:55,800
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a PHP if you take two strings which</font>

421
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:58,560
start with 0<font color="#CCCCCC"> E and then something then</font>

422
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:01,110
PHP comparison as zeros because it's

423
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,810
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's zero exponent something</font>

424
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:08,729
like this so so they just compared PHP

425
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:11,429
compares it as zeros yeah exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

426
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:14,340
it's possible to detect the password

427
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:16,200
hashing policy if you are able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign</font>

428
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,149
up with this password and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> login</font>

429
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this one there are more example</font>

430
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:22,680
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works also for show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 and</font>

431
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:27,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">for plain text as well I got them on my</font>

432
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:30,090
github and you can try that if it's if

433
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,190
it doesn't work it doesn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

434
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:34,199
company is not using md5 they can be

435
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,660
doing something else like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know they</font>

436
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">can just they can be comparing the</font>

437
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:43,290
strings with three equal signs not just

438
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:47,120
too but if it works then<font color="#CCCCCC"> its md5</font>

439
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:50,340
definitely and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've found one side who</font>

440
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:54,330
one side storing passwords in plain text

441
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:57,179
just using this or similar trick so even

442
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:58,679
users can do detection themselves they

443
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:10,080
just don't need to pull the company to

444
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:13,350
disclose that yeah yeah I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid the I</font>

445
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:18,120
think it's so does that mean that one in

446
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:22,199
256 passwords is is subject because it I

447
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:24,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean one in 256 ashes would become 0 e</font>

448
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,480
if they're if they're comparing this way

449
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:29,340
this is yeah it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how they are</font>

450
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,260
comparing that if they will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> comparing</font>

451
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,139
that with the three equal signs then

452
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:36,780
this doesn't work but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

453
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,840
anyone who uses md5 is already comparing

454
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:42,360
just with two equal signs or they can be

455
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,510
just you know fetching the data from the

456
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,889
day

457
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:47,310
they're based in a different way but if

458
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:57,300
they are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> two equal signs here then</font>

459
00:20:47,310 --> 00:21:00,210
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly yes they need</font>

460
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:09,780
to be yeah it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be hexadecimal</font>

461
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:18,660
string yeah thanks so yeah sometimes you

462
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:22,170
can just do this yeah anyone else can I

463
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:28,140
go to next slide right now just asking

464
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:31,890
so even if the you know people are able

465
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,900
to tell what the heck is just by looking

466
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:36,930
at the hash so if the database leaks

467
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:39,150
then you just look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the hitches and</font>

468
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:41,070
you're pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that you know this is</font>

469
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:47,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the bcrypt who thinks this is a big</font>

470
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:49,139
crypt ash oh great so this is md5 so

471
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,570
just by looking at the hash you will

472
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:55,700
know that this is 75 or show one or a

473
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:58,379
beaker<font color="#CCCCCC"> adesh or something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did so even</font>

474
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,840
if the company gets hacked there's no

475
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:04,680
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in not telling us what exactly</font>

476
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:09,750
they were using<font color="#CCCCCC"> for storing the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> D user</font>

477
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:15,000
passwords there is a nice example from

478
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:16,800
Anthony Ferrara who is done this he

479
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,880
wrote an application HQ sir appspot.com

480
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:23,450
and it tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

481
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">security through obscurity doesn't work</font>

482
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:29,820
he has done that yeah he gave the users

483
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:32,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">to passwords one is password the other</font>

484
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:35,669
one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple he gave them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to salts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> per</font>

485
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:39,990
the password and he gave them resulting

486
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:42,270
hash what he what the side was missing

487
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:44,490
were the exact algorithms how the hedge

488
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,830
was calculated so he just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave the users</font>

489
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:53,190
passwords and the salts and the

490
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:56,029
resulting hash and he gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> the users I</font>

491
00:22:53,190 --> 00:23:00,619
think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was 15 different algorithms</font>

492
00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:04,460
like this and the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> was to come up</font>

493
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:05,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the hash of a password foo and salt</font>

494
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,700
the bada bada bada bada bada bada bada

495
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:09,859
without actually knowing the algorithm

496
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,389
so you had to reverse the algorithm the

497
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:14,539
hashing algorithm you had to reverse

498
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:17,899
that and calculate a new hash for a new

499
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:20,899
password<font color="#E5E5E5"> just by looking at the hash and</font>

500
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:24,049
knowing passwords and salts well that's

501
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:28,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite interesting the results were</font>

502
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:30,379
really nice so there were people i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

503
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:33,019
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixing algorithms in total and</font>

504
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:34,849
there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> 14</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people there were three</font>

505
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:36,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who have found 14 of the</font>

506
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:38,479
algorithms just by looking at the hashes

507
00:23:36,469 --> 00:23:40,339
just by looking at the hashes and trying

508
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:42,919
to calculate the passwords and

509
00:23:40,339 --> 00:23:45,549
everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one guy Mattias</font>

510
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:48,200
globe was actually hugged the app and

511
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:53,330
maybe it made the appt and made the

512
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:56,570
server leaked the algorithm somehow so

513
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:59,239
he found a Miss configuration but it was

514
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,619
able to to generate all the 15 15

515
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:03,320
algorithms so just by looking at the

516
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:08,209
hashes people are able to reverse that

517
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:09,739
even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the algorithm is more more even</font>

518
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,989
if the algorithms different than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

519
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:13,580
plain md5 or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> antoni was doing</font>

520
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:15,469
some really weird things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to the</font>

521
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,418
passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know making them</font>

522
00:24:15,469 --> 00:24:19,399
reverse and stuff like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I will just</font>

523
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:23,450
not disclose any details if you want to

524
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:24,738
try that just go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead so just by</font>

525
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,479
looking at the hashes even if they are

526
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:28,219
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing md5</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plain show on just</font>

527
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:33,109
people are looking people are able to

528
00:24:28,219 --> 00:24:35,450
reverse that quite easily if any side is

529
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:38,330
using any open source software they are

530
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:40,159
actually disclosing by by design they

531
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:42,619
don't need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> even tell us because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

532
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,339
know open source software it's just open

533
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:50,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">source so so people can look at that and</font>

534
00:24:45,339 --> 00:24:53,989
just um tell how exactly the side is

535
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:56,089
storing user passwords also open<font color="#CCCCCC"> source</font>

536
00:24:53,989 --> 00:24:59,599
software makes it quite easy to fix

537
00:24:56,089 --> 00:25:03,879
actually security bugs in a in password

538
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:07,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">storage I have an example here this is</font>

539
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:09,230
prestashop they were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

540
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,390
using pine md5 to store

541
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:13,549
or user password actually they were

542
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,770
using salt as well but it was a static

543
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:17,780
salt it was a salt in a configuration so

544
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:21,850
the salt was dutiful sub result was the

545
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:24,230
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all the user passwords and</font>

546
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:26,570
somebody told him that hey you guys

547
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:31,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">should switch to be creped from md5 so</font>

548
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:32,780
they did that I did it like this they

549
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,280
were calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> passwords which is a PHP</font>

550
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:39,260
function to calculate the big rib hash

551
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:42,820
and they prepended salt to the user

552
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:46,820
password the thing is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the salt was</font>

553
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:49,100
56 characters long and you know bigger

554
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:53,360
it is trimming the passwords at 72

555
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:56,090
characters so 72 minus 56 I think it's

556
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,939
something around 16 maybe so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

557
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:01,070
actually truncating user passwords at 16

558
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:04,030
characters without you know even telling

559
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:06,620
the users this was a security<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue I</font>

560
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:08,480
was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix that just by looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

561
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,090
the code and you know making a pull

562
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,730
request just fixing it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> few minutes so</font>

563
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:15,530
that's what I like on an<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source</font>

564
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,870
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can actually fix simple things</font>

565
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:20,809
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not that simple quite important</font>

566
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:22,580
things like really really easily they

567
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:25,820
got more issues here like you know they

568
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:28,280
call it be great<font color="#CCCCCC"> sha256 for whatever</font>

569
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:31,220
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they just call it encrypt not</font>

570
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:37,899
a sh but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have fixed that in next</font>

571
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:40,640
revision so that's fixed as well so yeah

572
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:43,040
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's okay to disclose</font>

573
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,400
how the company is actually storing

574
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,870
passwords because and the company

575
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,580
doesn't need to be afraid there are

576
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:51,590
other companies disclosing passwords

577
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,540
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook and Twitter as well and</font>

578
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:56,480
just look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at my sides there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font>

579
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:58,100
nice companies and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay to disclose</font>

580
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,980
how the company is storing the user

581
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:03,080
passwords especially the site users<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

582
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:07,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">called password hashes bcrypt script and</font>

583
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:09,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">PB keyed something and argon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too and if</font>

584
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:12,199
this if the side is not using any of

585
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:15,740
these special<font color="#E5E5E5"> password ashes they should</font>

586
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,970
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix that and then disclose and they</font>

587
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,890
should definitely let me know so that i

588
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:21,740
can put them on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> side because i think</font>

589
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:22,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if they appear on my side with nice</font>

590
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,580
great

591
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:27,710
the users will love it more because they

592
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,809
can feel more you know confident that

593
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:33,260
the company knows what they are doing

594
00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:36,410
and stuff like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this even if the company</font>

595
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:38,570
is using you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's like md5 and</font>

596
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:40,220
they switch to be crypt the users will

597
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,389
quite love it because they were like oh

598
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,100
yeah you were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something robbed</font>

599
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:44,510
before but right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we are doing</font>

600
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,120
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice and you are not afraid to</font>

601
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,290
tell us<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you screwed up before so</font>

602
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:52,030
yeah I've been there and done that as

603
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:54,799
well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's okay to disclose</font>

604
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:58,668
especially if companies using slow

605
00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:01,790
password hashes and yeah that's it from

606
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:10,820
me I think yeah there are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

607
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:13,070
oh thank you questions although one

608
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:15,530
quick question in your a and B reading

609
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:18,290
ratings it wasn't so clear from the

610
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:21,260
slide are you requiring solve for the a

611
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:25,190
and B<font color="#E5E5E5"> ratings sorry I reckon are you</font>

612
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:27,140
hiring salt for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a and B way yeah</font>

613
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:29,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">because all the all the algorithms like</font>

614
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:31,669
bcrypt a script of and the other ones

615
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:39,860
they oh they already required assault so

616
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:42,860
yeah yeah I'm oh Jeff that just simple

617
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:45,530
one um<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you familiar with plain text</font>

618
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:47,600
offenders yeah I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah i'm just</font>

619
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:49,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering whether you yeah i'm nick from</font>

620
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,840
i want to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to slightly different</font>

621
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,330
direction because<font color="#E5E5E5"> pun text of the</font>

622
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">offenders is more like just a shaming</font>

623
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:57,860
but i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> also want to you know thank</font>

624
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:03,559
the companies for doing my job so I know

625
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:04,969
them here um you know you said it's

626
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:06,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible it's all the difference between</font>

627
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,120
different hashes but King children's

628
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,530
between just looking at the hash is

629
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,719
something without the<font color="#E5E5E5"> password of what's</font>

630
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:15,980
an S script bcrypt and what's using pbk

631
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,330
TF two or three is it possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> or most</font>

632
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,400
of the times yeah because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bigfoot</font>

633
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:21,678
usually starts with dollar sign to

634
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,750
something the dollar sign so that's a

635
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,730
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> crypt the script is slightly longer</font>

636
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,380
and yeah sometimes it is possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

637
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:30,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's most of the times yeah yeah</font>

638
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:32,150
okay it probably if it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypted</font>

639
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,650
or encrypted some sorry encoded to

640
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,270
basics before it could take some more

641
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:44,660
time but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

642
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:46,430
yeah all questions your pulse project is

643
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,560
it possible to contribute or is it

644
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:52,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">closed yeah definitely it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> required to</font>

645
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:55,250
contribute it's it's mandatory to

646
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:57,830
continue and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do that just</font>

647
00:29:55,250 --> 00:30:01,930
tweet me or send me an email to a link

648
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,929
to a public disclosure because I think

649
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:06,379
Bruce from password research already

650
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,090
done that they he<font color="#CCCCCC"> send me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like three</font>

651
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,590
links to two sides who actually

652
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:12,550
disclosed in there is a password<font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah</font>

653
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:15,649
it's mandatory I cannot do this alone

654
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:17,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

655
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:20,060
ongoing discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> for many years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

656
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,969
passwords come we are still fighting to

657
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:26,360
make companies to disclose how they are

658
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:28,280
storing your passwords and my own

659
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">personal opinion on this is basically</font>

660
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know if they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

661
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:36,530
disclose you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

662
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:38,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">expected worse expect the worst yeah</font>

663
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:41,110
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like either you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be on the good</font>

664
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,600
list or I will put<font color="#CCCCCC"> you on the list</font>

665
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:47,600
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that simple I will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I will</font>

666
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably name my project yeah if I mean</font>

667
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">over and over again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for every new leak</font>

668
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:55,310
we see we see unsold md5 still going on

669
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,290
we still see I unsalted sha-1 and

670
00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:00,560
receive all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bad implementations</font>

671
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:04,909
it's like somebody I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to say</font>

672
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:08,950
who it is board of directors or if it is

673
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:12,140
the developers but somebody is just not

674
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:15,440
watching the news for the past 10 15

675
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:18,250
years about all the leaks it's like oh

676
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,240
there's a leak well the obvious question

677
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,860
anybody on the server on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bow</font>

678
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,230
directors should be asking the own

679
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:27,199
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how do we store our</font>

680
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:28,760
customers passwords they don't they

681
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,460
don't ask those questions they just

682
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:34,790
assume well we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not stupid so this is</font>

683
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:37,400
never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen to us and we need</font>

684
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:39,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">to change that so again thank you maybe</font>

685
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,700
one remark I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about Ashley</font>

686
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,879
Madison that they are storing passwords

687
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,380
in decrypt but they have done something

688
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">really bad to the passwords as well they</font>

689
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,010
were storing them<font color="#CCCCCC"> also in md5 like</font>

690
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:53,690
besides<font color="#E5E5E5"> the be crippled</font>

691
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:55,490
so if the company scores a or b because

692
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:57,890
they tell us that they store passwords

693
00:31:55,490 --> 00:32:01,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">in bcrypt they can they still have a lot</font>

694
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:03,710
of opportunities to screw up but this is

695
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:05,060
not possible to verify we just need to

696
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,680
trust them if they tell us that they use

697
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:09,020
bcrypt we just need to trust them<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

698
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,210
they used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be quick so it's not really</font>

699
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:14,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible to verify without taking the</font>

700
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:15,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">company and I'm not going there soon and</font>

701
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,400
look interested in the Ashley Madison

702
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:21,230
case as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> soonish f prime which is</font>

703
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,360
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good groups doing</font>

704
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:27,170
password cracking for correct me if you

705
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,090
can and other password hashing cracking

706
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:30,560
competitions they did a talk at

707
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:32,510
passwords call at university of

708
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:36,080
cambridge in UK last year where they

709
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:37,460
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the wealthy how Ashley</font>

710
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,980
Madison had done pretty much everything

711
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:43,490
wrong in their password implementation

712
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:47,480
so initially bcrypt oh look looks good

713
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:50,510
and then you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> kibou</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we're</font>

714
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to take a break until 12 and the</font>

715
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:55,700
next speaker up is Bruce Marshall who

716
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:58,010
will also<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a really interesting talk</font>

717
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:01,460
about how you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be proactively</font>
