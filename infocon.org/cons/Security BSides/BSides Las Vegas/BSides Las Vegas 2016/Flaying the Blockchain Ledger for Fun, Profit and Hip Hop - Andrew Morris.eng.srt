the actual layout of the talk that i'm

long time did a lot of red team work and

94
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,649
stuff like that I've been doing computer

95
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,630
stuff for a really long time my life

96
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,190
considered and it's surprising how bad i

97
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,120
still am at it i dropped out of high

98

of like get it completely out there

103
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,370
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just talking on behalf of</font>

104
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,870
myself this is my own recreational

105
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,430
research i'm not talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> on behalf of my</font>

108
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,230
do anything with black chain or bitcoins

109
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,950
as again this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I am NOT</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

110
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,929
Bitcoin expert which is I guess a little

111
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,940
weird because I'm playing one right now

112
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,340
but Bitcoin and blockchain are massively

113
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,810
massively massively complicated I've

114
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,850
read a lot about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I understand it</font>

115
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:12,330
a decent amount but it's still very very

116
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">complex you're probably not going to</font>

117
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,390
walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from this talk with a really</font>

118
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,530
intricate understanding of blockchain

119
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,019
you're gonna have a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> understanding</font>

120
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,608
of it but I really highly recommend that

121
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,130
you actually read about it yourselves

122
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:24,750
and hopefully that'll I'll facilitate

123
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,040
that happening and please let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me know if</font>

124
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,480
you see anything that's inaccurate you

125
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,410
can just shout it<font color="#CCCCCC"> at me right now</font>

126
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,450
don't care don't worry about

127
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,750
embarrassing me<font color="#E5E5E5"> or anything like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

144
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:17,970
trying to buy this and then on februari

145
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,180
14 2015<font color="#CCCCCC"> Martin tralee tweets who the</font>

fuck has my 15 million dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need my</font>

147
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,070
fucking money back though I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need my</font>

148
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:28,140
money back this isn't a fucking joke WTF

149
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:30,090
somebody named<font color="#CCCCCC"> daquan said he was</font>

150
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,219
Kanye's boy and I signed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the deal to buy</font>

151
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">Paul bow and sent the Bitcoin call the</font>

152
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:38,610
police this is bullshit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw this</font>

153
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:40,560
tweet at the time and I and I saw and I

154
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,920
saw this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I know just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough about</font>

155
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,460
Bitcoin to know like scheme hands went

156
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,740
on I can probably figure this thing out

157
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,940
so then I had the question is it

158
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,430
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually find this</font>

159
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,469
transaction and figure out like find it

160
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,850
on the ledger right 15 million dollars

161
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,310
is a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a non-trivial</font>

162
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,780
amount of money and I know just<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font>

163
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,310
at the time about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin to know that</font>

164
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,390
all transactions are broadcast

165
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:08,220
everywhere so the thought is why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

166
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,229
replicate in the again the ledgers

167
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,310
unencrypted it's everywhere I knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

168
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,890
enough to know that it was maybe

169
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,300
possible so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to replicate the</font>

170
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,669
entirety of the blockchain ledger and

171
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,100
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> search it somehow and I'm</font>

172
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,870
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find this transaction</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font>

173
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,730
to see if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could locate this specific</font>

174
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,990
transaction in the ledger so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> query</font>

175
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:28,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">is basically going to look like given a</font>

176
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:30,630
date range find any transactions that

177
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:34,320
fell under a certain dollar amount at

178
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:36,000
the time so my approach is actually pull

179
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,040
apart the block certain like get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

180
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,460
ledger get the actual block chain ledger

181
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,259
parse out all of the raw Bitcoin transit

182
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,620
actions put it into a format Kyle like

183
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:49,380
this shove the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a database that</font>

184
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,240
I can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask questions of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

185
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,520
some queries and figure it out from

186
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,470
there so before I go any further<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh wait</font>

187
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">and hang on this is actually like pseudo</font>

188
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,419
query language of like what I actually

189
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,770
am trying to do to locate this thing so

190
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,880
raise your hand if you're familiar with

191
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bitcoin if you've heard of Bitcoin</font>

192
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,699
before okay all right great so most

193
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,919
people have heard of Bitcoin so just to

194
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,889
give like a quick overview and I mean

195
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:17,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really quick bitcoin is a</font>

196
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:18,780
cryptocurrency it's kind of the first

197
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,880
cryptocurrency as far as I know at least

198
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:24,448
the first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> its kind its peer to peer</font>

199
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,789
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no trusted third party which</font>

200
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:27,990
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no there's no paypal</font>

201
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:29,550
there's no venmo there's no one

202
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,080
brokering the transactions everything

203
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,880
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens from one person to</font>

204
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,520
another person<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's distributed it's</font>

205
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,280
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like cash except on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

206
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,960
whereas<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have a hundred dollars in</font>

207
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,030
your wallet and somebody runs up to you

208
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,250
and they punch you in the face and they

209
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,888
take your<font color="#CCCCCC"> wallet you can't go to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US</font>

212
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,830
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that if somebody takes your</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Bitcoin it is cryptographically</font>

216
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,780
infeasible for a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font>

217
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,849
reasons the ledger is distributed

218
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,289
amongst a network of people who want to

219
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,330
be a part of the network so that means

220
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:09,259
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual the itemized ledger of</font>

221
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:11,550
all transactions is held by everyone

00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:13,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hope proof of work</font>

223
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,440
to prevent double spending which

224
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:17,789
basically just means that you can't

225
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,380
spend a coin<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's already been spent</font>

226
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:24,240
unless you put in the actual

227
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,800
computational like they call them votes

228
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,930
but unless you crunch the CPU and you

229
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,000
actually brute force the proof of work

230
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,549
in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so and a proof of work is</font>

231
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,309
basically something that is hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

232
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:37,559
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time but easy to verify so</font>

233
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:39,929
basically given a hash or something like

234
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,880
that like it's easy for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say oh</font>

235
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:43,228
this this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this proof of work is</font>

236
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,520
good once I already know the answer but

237
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:46,290
it's hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the first one to</font>

238
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually achieve the proof of work I'll</font>

239
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,010
go into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit everything's</font>

240
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,100
auditable back to the Genesis block

241
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:54,540
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first-ever blockchain block</font>

242
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,340
that ever happened all the way back to

243
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">the very</font>

244
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:00,960
coins are actually mind with cpu so you

245
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,790
actually cryptographically bring them

246
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,280
into existence the same way kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

247
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,230
how you mind gold you put in work you

248
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,470
put in<font color="#CCCCCC"> cpu power and you actually are</font>

249
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,540
rewarded<font color="#CCCCCC"> with coins there's actually</font>

00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,580
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a non turing-complete</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bitcoin</font>

251
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,680
scripting language as a part of it which

252
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,110
as if it couldn't get any more

253
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,420
complicated there's a programming

254
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,210
language that goes with it it takes

255
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:27,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">about 15 new blocks or mind every 15 ish</font>

256
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:29,250
minutes which<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically means that it</font>

257
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,630
takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 minutes to validate a</font>

258
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,100
transaction and if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know more</font>

259
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it I really highly recommend that</font>

260
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">you read the paper so when you send</font>

261
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,849
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin your you are signing a</font>

262
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,180
coin and you're letting<font color="#E5E5E5"> them know like</font>

263
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,440
hey you're basically saying now you are

264
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one who is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be able to sign</font>

you are the one who's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

266
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,780
to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> this coin the transaction</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

267
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,370
broadcast everywhere and everyone knows

268
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,630
everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens and the network</font>

269
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,670
regulates itself with something called

270
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,410
difficulty which basically just allows

271
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,760
the block chain network to continue to

272
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,530
replicate every 15 minutes when there's

273
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,880
more people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the network it's harder</font>

274
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,199
to mine bitcoin when there are less

275
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,460
people in the network it's easier to

276
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,350
mine bitcoin and the dollar value

277
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,600
fluctuates because that's how economics

278
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,370
works is the coin anonymous kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it's</font>

279
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,410
anonymous in that you don't know who's

280
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,600
making transactions but<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone knows</font>

281
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,100
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> every transaction takes place so in</font>

282
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,720
some ways it's more anonymous than cash

283
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,940
in other ways it's less anonymous than

284
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,250
cash it can be tumbled to be harder to

285
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,050
track and it basically depends on the

286
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">OPSEC of the person when you're talking</font>

00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,000
means you can create you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can send</font>

secure uses known secure cryptographic

296
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:44,370
protocols it uses things that are kind

297
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:48,990
of like widely accepted as being secure

298
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,620
in the crypto world attacks are possible

299
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,450
there's something called like a

300
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,550
51-percent attack which is where half of

301

the people on the blockchain<font color="#CCCCCC"> ledgers</font>

302
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,579
half of the members collude together to

303
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,550
change something all at the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

304
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,650
it's very very unlikely and most of the

305
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,390
actual attacks on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin involved just</font>

306
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:05,189
having shitty operational security so

307
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,490
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actual block chain</font>

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,050
the blockchain ledger is a list of every

everything moving forward which

324
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:40,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically means once something is on the</font>

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,250
ledger as soon as another block gets on

326
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,930
top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never change the thing</font>

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,609
people agree to roll back the blockchain

329
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,080
is made up of blocks as you could

330
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,730
probably imagine blocks are made up of

331
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,890
transactions transactions are made up of

332
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,870
inputs and outputs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and output is a</font>

333
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:59,470
wallet sending coins to somebody else

334
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,700
it's basically you saying this person<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

335
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,680
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these coins at</font>

336
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,690
some point and an input is somebody

337
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,969
acknowledging that referencing your

338
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,649
transaction then making another output

339
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,570
to somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> else this is relevant at</font>

340
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:12,730
some point so if you want to actually

341
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,079
access the block chain this is like the

342
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,940
plebeian way to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I say that</font>

343
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">like kind of joking but you can go to</font>

344
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,140
block chain explorers like<font color="#CCCCCC"> block chain</font>

345
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,430
dot info stuff like that which are ways

346
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,290
that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> click through the ledger</font>

347
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,579
and actually go and browse while<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

348
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,349
browse transactions stuff like that

349
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:27,579
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them there's even an</font>

350
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,709
offline one that you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

351
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:30,969
actually parses the ledger yourself I'll

352
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:33,550
get on that a little bit this is what it

353
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,260
looks like it's not terribly clear here

354
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,149
but the height basically means like

355
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,829
which block it is in order the first

356
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:41,589
block was blocked number one at a height

357
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:43,319
of 1 and then as it increases so on and

358
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:45,040
so forth the age<font color="#E5E5E5"> self-explanatory</font>

359
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,720
transactions is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

360
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,819
transactions that take place inside of

361
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,709
that given block total spent is the USD

362
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:54,070
value of all of those transactions added

363
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:57,089
up relayed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically means like this</font>

364
00:12:54,070 --> 00:13:00,310
is the this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the person this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

365
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:02,230
group or this is who<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertise the</font>

366
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,699
advertiser of whoever mind that block

367
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,560
whoever brought it into existence and

368
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,320
then the size is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data size of</font>

369
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,810
the block itself you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can look at Bitcoin</font>

370
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,360
addresses which is Bitcoin wallets you

371
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">can look at given transactions on</font>

372
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,490
websites<font color="#E5E5E5"> like these blockchain explorers</font>

373
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,200
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunately you can't actually do</font>

374
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:24,820
what I needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

375
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:27,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">I use case which is basically I need to</font>

376
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:29,680
know all transactions that happen in

377
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,689
this value at this given time there's no

378
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,219
way to ask that<font color="#E5E5E5"> of blockchain explorers</font>

379
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:36,310
that currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist there's no api</font>

380
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,720
exposed for that so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> again this</font>

381
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:40,540
is a reminder this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of query</font>

382
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,190
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do ish but there's no way</font>

383
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do that on blockchain explorers</font>

384
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:46,270
because they don't expose the data to

385
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,530
you in that way there's some potential

386
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:51,100
cheat codes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

387
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:53,230
shortcuts web BTC<font color="#E5E5E5"> com actually has an</font>

388
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,610
entire dump of their database it's like

389
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,750
once every day and they have the

390
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,120
previous four days that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> download</font>

391
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,650
or you can generate it yourself with a B

392
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,830
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think stands for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a blockchain</font>

393
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:04,510
Explorer you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> also download</font>

394
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,650
a docker file that does the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

395
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,540
for you because it's a little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

396
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:09,520
pain in the ass to get running somebody

397
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,949
talker eyes dit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's mega mega easy</font>

398
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,300
to get running I did it but when you're

399
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,560
parsing out the entire block technology

400
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,689
had ended up just being a shitload of

401
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,869
data and I was like I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily</font>

402
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:23,320
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that so let's talk about</font>

403
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:25,930
actually ripping apart<font color="#CCCCCC"> self so the</font>

404
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,750
ledger is made up of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dat files there's</font>

405
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:31,959
currently there's about six hundred

406
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:35,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">about give or take 600 128 megabyte dat</font>

407
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:37,420
files they're named as such each dat

408
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,130
file that you get when you install like

409
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,620
Bitcoin core and you replicate the

410
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:44,740
ledger each dat file is a serialized

411
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:47,050
binary blob each dat file contains

412
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,150
blocks each block contains transactions

413
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:51,609
and each transaction contains inputs and

414
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,380
outputs<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data structure is complex</font>

415
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:56,590
only if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know anything about</font>

416
00:14:53,380 --> 00:15:01,170
data structures which I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so this</font>

417
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:03,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">is like my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> military grade PowerPoint</font>

418
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:05,290
skills of like actually visualizing to

419
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,570
you what the ledger looks like you've

420
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,189
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the block header which is the header</font>

421
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,360
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's just some metadata about</font>

422
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,830
the block i'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what's in each</font>

423
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,080
then you've got this big transaction

424
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,090
thing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> output section</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in an input</font>

425
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,340
section and then itemized inputs and

426
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,470
outputs here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they there's blocks on</font>

427
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:23,320
blocks on blocks on blocks so if you

428
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,060
actually want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get the ledger</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the good</font>

429
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,190
way the right way to do it is to install

430
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bitcoin core or install like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin</font>

431
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:32,170
mining client and let<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sit there and</font>

432
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,689
replicate the ledger from the block

433
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,770
chain from the Bitcoin network

434
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:39,060
so it means<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually like pulling in</font>

435
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,680
like actually building the ledger from

436
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,540
all of the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> members of the network</font>

437
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,370
you need to have about 100 gigs

438
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,010
allocated for this currently at this

439
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:49,770
very point in time the ledger is about

440
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:51,270
80 gigs total the easy way is I'll just

441
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,880
upload a torrent file of all this if any

442
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:56,160
of you guys actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it just pay</font>

443
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,420
attended or something like that it'll be

444
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,890
a lot faster so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one it actually</font>

445
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">looks like you hex dump but it's like I</font>

446
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:03,810
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what about any of this is but</font>

447
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:07,640
the answers are in there somewhere so I

448
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:09,900
set out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually try and learn I</font>

449
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,990
tried to actually parse it out myself

450
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:15,540
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is me and like them like</font>

451
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:19,830
mapping out the actual like bite

452
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:22,079
structures and it was really really hard

453
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:25,170
and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it was just like</font>

454
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:28,710
this is so much I don't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

455
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:31,339
that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to do this so</font>

456
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:35,130
I started writing my own parser via<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tom</font>

457
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:37,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">gebhard guide and then I realized that I</font>

458
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:39,120
suck at programming and so I searched

459
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:42,360
github really really hard and I found

460
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,730
this guy wrote a blockchain parsing

461
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,890
library called PI blockchain like

462
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,240
literally a month before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started</font>

463
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,069
searching<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this was like ah alright</font>

464
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,430
that works but<font color="#E5E5E5"> these two other people</font>

465
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:55,230
wrote like this this guy wrote an e-book

466
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,750
and you publish the code block tools

467
00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:01,800
it's a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good reference and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Z</font>

468
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:04,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">nort 987 wrote a like C++ compiled</font>

469
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,899
blockchain parsing tool that is good but

470
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:09,180
it's a little dated because it at this

471
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,189
point it was built for when the ledger

472
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:14,400
was like one gigabyte and now the

473
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:18,770
ledgers like 80 so it doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> super</font>

474
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:22,740
well so the stuff that I actually need I

475
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:26,339
need for the sake of my use case which

476
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,540
is figuring out<font color="#E5E5E5"> where this tweet</font>

477
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:29,010
happened or where the transaction

478
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,710
happened that the tweeds referencing I

479
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:34,500
would ideally like a transaction ID I

480
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:37,080
want the<font color="#CCCCCC"> payer wallet receiver wallet</font>

481
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,630
when the transaction happened how much

482
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:43,199
Bitcoin was moved and the equivalent US

483
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:45,360
dollar value of how much was moved there

484
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,809
are a lot of problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this because</font>

485
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the way bitcoin trains</font>

486
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:53,908
work there's inputs and outputs so there

487
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:56,230
is no straightforward like there's no

488
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:57,639
given transaction it's not like when you

489
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,200
hand somebody twenty dollars and you

490
00:17:57,639 --> 00:18:00,758
lose twenty dollars and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> gain twenty</font>

491
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,799
dollars that's not how it works there's

492
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:06,009
these complex sets of inputs and outputs

493
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,899
so there's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a form of almost a kind</font>

494
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:09,190
of state that you have to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

495
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:10,629
everything is referencing something

496
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> previously happened so you have</font>

497
00:18:10,629 --> 00:18:14,620
to have everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't do it at</font>

498
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:17,379
all which I<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize the hardware there's</font>

499
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:20,018
another thing the notion of change in

500
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:21,789
block chain<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin so when if I have</font>

501
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:22,899
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin wallet I think actually I</font>

502
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:25,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this at some point so I'll</font>

503
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:27,039
come back to it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> payer wallet is not</font>

504
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:29,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">explicitly stated in the ledger there's</font>

505
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,049
no there's no pay or wallet there's no

506
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,580
pay or public key you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to derive it</font>

507
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:35,440
yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that was another problem</font>

508
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,970
that I ran into the exchange rate

509
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,700
there's no place in the blockchain

510
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:42,249
ledger where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> says this is how much us</font>

511
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,110
stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> USD Bitcoin was worth at this time</font>

512
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:47,110
that's a that's a piece of metadata that

513
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:48,779
is a that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an economic thing so I am</font>

514
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:51,668
going to have to introduce that myself

515
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:53,679
big data whatever it was it's 80 gigs

516
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:55,360
and it was it's a lot it's more than I

517
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,759
could do in a text editor with a set of

518
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">bash scripts and then transaction</font>

519
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:03,159
patterns this dives into why parsing

520
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:05,168
addresses from the block chain is hard

521
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:08,110
because there are multiple different

522
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:09,490
Bitcoin clients have different

523
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,799
implementations at different point in

524
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,080
time of how to specify the address

525
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:15,940
that's happening so some early on in

526
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,918
version one would say I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push</font>

527
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,649
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> data to the stack and then I'm</font>

528
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,999
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to verify it later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's like</font>

529
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:23,350
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> opcodes or something like that and</font>

530
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:25,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">later it's upgraded so there's a number</font>

531
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,350
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different patterns and it sucks it's</font>

532
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:29,649
a huge pain in the ass to actually parse

533
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:31,389
out the transaction ID getting this is

534
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:34,508
actually really<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy all you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font>

535
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:36,879
just shot 256 the data itself of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

536
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:41,379
transaction done all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right that one is</font>

537
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:45,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually very very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy Ben take take</font>

538
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:45,149
the transit Oh Shh this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font>

539
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:52,690
don't don't look I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix that</font>

540
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:54,399
sorry guys time this is actually also

541
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,409
really easy the in the block header

542
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:59,699
there's actually up here in the block

543
00:19:56,409 --> 00:20:02,649
header there's an epic<font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamp that is</font>

544
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:05,830
when it's the timestamp of when exactly

545
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:07,478
the block started to be mined the

546
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,399
receiver wallet is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

547
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:10,539
pain in the ass it's basically this is

548
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:12,268
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I was talking about where</font>

549
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:15,700
there's different patterns it's in the

550
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:18,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">script payload which basically is here</font>

551
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:22,149
somewhere in the output and basically

552
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:25,419
what it is is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin telling this</font>

553
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:27,428
Bitcoin script engine that it's it's

554
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:31,539
pushing some it's executing some op

555
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:35,470
codes in a way to verify a public key

556
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:36,759
and the wrist there's again like I said

557
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,489
there's lots of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> patterns ah</font>

558
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:40,960
there's a basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost every</font>

559
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:43,299
transaction that I found fell under

560
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,710
about six different patterns fortunately

561
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:46,779
Tom<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gephardt the guy that I talked about</font>

562
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,419
really broke down I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> all six of</font>

563
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:51,580
those patterns version<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of Bitcoin</font>

564
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:55,149
multi signature transactions stuff like

565
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:57,309
that so I ended up actually using pi

566
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:59,738
block chain which was built which was

567
00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:02,019
developed by Edward the guy that I was

568
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:04,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">referring to earlier he had not yet</font>

569
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:07,090
implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the patterns he'd</font>

570
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,769
only implemented one and so to get good

571
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:11,019
coverage I actually had to go through

572
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:12,820
and implement two other ones I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

573
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:15,190
up missing data about a fraction of a

574
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,830
percent of all transactions ever by not

575
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:21,249
writing parsers for every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single address</font>

576
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:22,570
pattern format but whatever I didn't

577
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:23,529
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to and then the change</font>

578
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,509
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I was talking about before</font>

579
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:29,019
so if i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bitcoin wallet with 20</font>

580
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:31,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">bitcoin and i want to send you i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

581
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:33,220
say remember writing that send five

582
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:36,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">bitcoin to Kanye West what I'm actually</font>

583
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:40,389
doing is I'm I'm going to sign<font color="#E5E5E5"> an output</font>

584
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:42,549
to you of<font color="#E5E5E5"> five Bitcoin and then I'm</font>

585
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:44,228
going to sign one to myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 15</font>

586
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:46,239
Bitcoin so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just looking at</font>

587
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:48,039
outputs then this may look like two

588
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:49,330
different transactions where someone is

589
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:51,009
getting five Bitcoin and somebody's

590
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,269
getting 15 Bitcoin so you have to

591
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:54,039
actually build the state to figure out

592
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:56,080
where the coins came from which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

593
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:57,279
non-trivial you need the entire chain

594
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,300
you need all the inputs to actually

595
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,430
solve this

596
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,480
and it's this thing exactly like a

597
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,310
wallet that has a hundred million

598
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,310
dollars worth of bitcoin like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I buy a</font>

599
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:07,750
coffee for five dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ledger if</font>

600
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,860
you're parsing it without<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the</font>

601
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,800
state it's going to look like I'm

602
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,600
sending somebody 999 million dollars in

603
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,040
somebody else five dollars so you have

604
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,300
to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this date</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to really understand</font>

605
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,290
where it's coming from and where it's

606
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:23,139
going to so the sender is the public key

607
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:26,889
that signed the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin before before</font>

608
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:28,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get so basically when I if I send</font>

609
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:32,020
you a Bitcoin what I'm doing is I'm

610
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,450
signing the transaction with your public

611
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,490
key authorizing you then to be the one

612
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:40,300
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> spends it technically the wallet</font>

613
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:44,020
doesn't actually exist it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a way to</font>

614
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:46,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wallet ID is just a way to represent</font>

615
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,290
a public key it's a different data

616
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,610
format of the public key and it's

617
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:54,220
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the public key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chopped up</font>

618
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:57,760
hashed hashed moved around a little bit

619
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:59,830
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then base 50 aided not base64 word</font>

620
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,980
because that makes too much sense base

621
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:05,740
58 'add which basically just does like

622
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,850
it's a representation of like it's the

623
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,160
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as basics before except</font>

624
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,510
without all the punctuation and my buddy

625
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,430
so like you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to link everything</font>

626
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,530
together to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make anything right sense</font>

627
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:17,290
and my my buddy in co worker wrote this

628
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:18,970
giant big ol bastard of a query that

629
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:24,670
actually makes all of those connections

630
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:26,080
I'll get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that so I was trying to</font>

631
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,310
actually build all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

632
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,110
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like make all these</font>

633
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:32,470
different connections but I didn't

634
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:34,870
actually have enough RAM on my machine

635
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:37,900
to do all this so i overnighted 32

636
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:39,610
gigabytes of ram into my desktop and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

637
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,100
still didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough so that was the</font>

638
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:45,669
stupidest like two hundred dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

639
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:47,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever spent in my entire life so I'm like</font>

640
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:50,080
freaking out because I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to link all</font>

641
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:52,000
these inputs and outputs together and I

642
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,530
have a really shitty internet connection

643
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,360
at home and I don't have enough RAM and

644
00:23:53,530 --> 00:24:00,220
my desktop to do it so my roommate both

645
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,379
of my roommates actually saved the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font>

646
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:05,440
and my roommate like a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> days ago</font>

647
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,880
trove me drove me to his office where

648
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,860
they have gigabit fiber and I uploaded

649
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,980
the hundred gig data set of parsing

650
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,139
stuff out spun up this ridiculous

651
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,970
sleepy fee AWS server that cost me like

652
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,770
five<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars an hour and so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was like</font>

653
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:19,080
oh Jesus<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christ I got it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really make</font>

654
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:20,490
sure this thing goes down made<font color="#E5E5E5"> the giant</font>

655
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">Franken query and then like ripped</font>

656
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,360
everything back out so the actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount</font>

657
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:26,580
of Bitcoin I'll come back to that side

658
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then the amount of bitcoin is in</font>

659
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:32,340
Satoshi's that's actually pulled from

660
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:33,809
here in the outputs this is the amount

661
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,178
of Bitcoin in a transaction and it comes

662
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:39,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the form of Satoshi's which there are</font>

663
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:42,210
a hundred million Satoshi's in a Bitcoin

664
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:46,199
that's the colloquial term named after

665
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:48,600
the developer of Bitcoin then comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

666
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,450
problem of the historical USD exchange

667
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,909
rate so like I said the dollar value of

668
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:56,610
a transaction at a given time is not in

669
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:58,350
the ledger it is not there's no field

670
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:00,360
that says hey this you know bitcoins

671
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,949
worth a hundred dollars this day the way

672
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,559
it actually works is the economy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

673
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:06,570
currency trades actually decide how much

674
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,960
money a bitcoin is where it's at a given

675
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:11,639
day so I had to build a lookup table it

676
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">was really actually probably the easiest</font>

677
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,210
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to</font>

678
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,720
build a lookup table<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're given a epic</font>

679
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:20,850
time stamp and an amount of Bitcoin look

680
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,880
up how much bitcoins was worth at that

681
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:28,860
time convert it and return me a dollar

682
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:31,590
value so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I downloaded all of the</font>

683
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:34,379
historical Bitcoin pricing data from

684
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:36,870
blockchain info this link which I have

685
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the pastebin thing that I set up and</font>

686
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:41,489
I wrote just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a function that basically</font>

687
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:43,439
took given an amount of Satoshi's it

688
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,540
actually converted that to US dollar

689
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,850
amount of Satoshi's in an epic UNIX

690
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:52,530
epoch timestamp and it returned however

691
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:56,189
much USD the transaction would have been

692
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:58,530
at the time and that was everything so I

693
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:00,299
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> had everything that I needed and I</font>

694
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:05,570
parsed out kind of this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just the</font>

695
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:07,980
outputs there's also the inputs but then

696
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,600
my parser source code<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to be</font>

697
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,760
here it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> there yet it's private</font>

698
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,299
right now so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to unprivate it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

699
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,549
probably do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> today it's really</font>

700
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:21,230
really simple because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I offloaded the</font>

701
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:24,000
majority of the work to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy Edwards</font>

702
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,930
library that I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's</font>

703
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">like I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it's like</font>

704
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:29,580
I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like 100 lines of code it's</font>

705
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:32,399
not a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I did have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

706
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:35,100
on adding code to his library to make it

707
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,740
parse the other address<font color="#E5E5E5"> formats it</font>

708
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:41,280
requires Python 3.5 it will not work

709
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:43,110
with Python 3.4 will definitely not work

710
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,460
with Python 27 and I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

711
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">multithread it but I stuck at</font>

712
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,020
programming so that's not done yet and

713
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the code sucks sorry so then it was</font>

714
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,470
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> like getting it into a database</font>

715
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:55,710
because I need I then now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I have</font>

716
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:57,000
this I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get it into a place that</font>

717
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,910
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> query it and it's</font>

718
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,130
actually split apart so I chose to use a

719
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:04,320
really hipster database technology

720
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:07,130
called click house developed by Yandex

721
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,679
the Russian social media company

722
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:13,580
internet provider search engine search

723
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,600
engine that's right that's I knew<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

724
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,550
why well because one of my co-workers

725
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,889
recommended it to me and that's

726
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,210
basically the end of that it allows

727
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,320
views which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really cool i don't know</font>

728
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:25,500
if this is a common thing in databases

729
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,360
but a view is where you build you have a

730
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,880
query and then it basically saved that

731
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,439
query<font color="#E5E5E5"> or it treats that query as a</font>

732
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,740
separate table the output of that query

733
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,420
so i used the views to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> link</font>

734
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,010
together the inputs and the outputs to

735
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,250
create the state that was the thing that

736
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:42,750
like ate all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ram in my machine</font>

737
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:44,760
click house is really really fast it

738
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,620
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ram but if the query</font>

739
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,940
that you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not going to fit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

740
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,620
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> much RAM you have on your</font>

741
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,480
machine then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just straight up not</font>

742
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,820
going to execute it so you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

743
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">no shit okay and it writes everything to</font>

744
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:59,820
disk which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is nice so I ended</font>

745
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:02,730
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with after parsing the entire block</font>

746
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:05,100
chain ledger I ended up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with ninety</font>

747
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:07,320
eight gigabytes of plaintext<font color="#E5E5E5"> CSV it took</font>

748
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,330
about 13 hours to parse on my like I

749
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,159
seven or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 15</font>

750
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:13,980
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to etl one time into the</font>

751
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,830
database and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I just use this</font>

752
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:20,760
basically just read it shove it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

753
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:22,230
database this is where I linking the

754
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:27,080
outputs<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the inputs is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you</font>

755
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:32,400
the big nasty query that I ran<font color="#CCCCCC"> into but</font>

756
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:36,179
that is one sequel query so that's just

757
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:38,279
one giant big ugly query but I end up

758
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the train</font>

759
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:41,549
action ID the<font color="#E5E5E5"> payer wallet the payee</font>

760
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,369
while the amount of Satoshi's US dollar

761
00:28:41,549 --> 00:28:46,379
epic<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stamp and the given date this</font>

762
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:47,999
is the query I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh please</font>

763
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:53,129
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask me to explain anything about</font>

764
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:55,739
this because I cannot so once i actually

765
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:57,689
got everything shoved into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> database</font>

766
00:28:55,739 --> 00:29:01,529
this is what it ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up looking like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

767
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:05,070
have outputs i have inputs outputs

768
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:06,269
inputs formatted for me all nice and

769
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,830
then when I like mash everything

770
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:10,200
together in the view<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have something</font>

771
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,968
like this so then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> started actually</font>

772
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,849
asking questions now that I had this

773
00:29:11,969 --> 00:29:18,299
nice parsed out blockchain ledger and I

774
00:29:14,849 --> 00:29:20,999
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know ok how many transactions</font>

775
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:26,190
have happened on the ledger over 1

776
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:27,899
million dollars a shitload 60,000

777
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:29,879
transactions that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> over 1 million</font>

778
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:31,830
dollars at the time how many

779
00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:34,949
transactions have happened over 10

780
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:37,320
million dollars 414 how many

781
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:41,759
transactions have happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> over a</font>

782
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:43,439
hundred million dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 transactions</font>

783
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:46,559
that at the time were<font color="#CCCCCC"> over a hundred</font>

784
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,460
million dollars which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is ridiculous</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

785
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,809
then I asked like well what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

786
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,919
biggest one so what I actually did is I

787
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:52,739
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> did like show me all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest</font>

788
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,779
ones ever and then just graph it out for

789
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:57,059
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> the biggest one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever was a hundred</font>

790
00:29:54,779 --> 00:30:00,089
and twenty seven million dollars on

791
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:01,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">November 22nd 2013 somebody actually</font>

792
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,999
wrote an article<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it I don't have</font>

793
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:06,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">the link that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> google the</font>

794
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:09,809
date and they were like I think they

795
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:13,049
wrote like quote somebody just moved a

796
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:15,749
shitload of money in Bitcoin what a

797
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:17,519
title and so then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like well how</font>

798
00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:19,049
many transactions have ever happened 140

802
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:29,129
means what's the largest what's the I'm

803
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:31,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry let me rephrase that what is the</font>

804
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:34,019
largest US dollar transaction that's

805

806
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:39,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">just been sitting there waiting to be</font>

807
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:41,669
claimed there is a 34 million dollar

808
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:43,080
Bitcoin transaction that happened two

809
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:44,849
years ago and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just sitting there</font>

in two years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just hanging out</font>

813
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:51,520

it's

815
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,950
now or 34 million dollars I don't know

how much it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was at the time it that's</font>

817
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,610
the biggest Walt<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been moving</font>

818
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:59,649
around what are the days when the most

819
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:01,810
US dollars have been traded in Bitcoin

820
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:03,460
so I don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good like way of</font>

821
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:07,720
actually looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but i will read</font>

822
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:12,730
to you this was 20 27 trillion dollars

823
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:16,630
on january twenty 4 2016 then leading

824
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:19,960
that was 11 trillion dollars on january

825
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:21,400
23rd the day before and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then yeah</font>

826
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,130
there's some other ones so any any kind

827
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,080
of queries like this a lot a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot a lot</font>

828
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:28,420
of money moved<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't actually finish</font>

829
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,310
the slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sorry but i can also ask</font>

830
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:32,620
how much like how much money if given

831
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:33,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bitcoin wallet you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do</font>

832
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,709
this on blotching about info anyway so

833
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,389
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not as exciting but how</font>

834
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:39,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">many how much money how much USD has</font>

835

00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:45,490
dollars in donations same tired bae

837
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:46,929
three thousand dollars in donations so

838
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,190
now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually ask questions like</font>

839
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:50,200
what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> average amount of</font>

840
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:52,420
transactions per month what is the most

841

what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the what is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> average amount</font>

842
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:57,160
of US dollars moved in a given day what

843
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,960
is the most USD lost by somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

844
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,460
the saddest query of all time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

845
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't actually read it but it's who</font>

846
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,870
bought the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> bitcoin for the most</font>

847
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:06,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">money and sold it for the least money</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm just like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even know that</font>

849
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:10,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">i can bring myself to do that because i</font>

850
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:11,980
would just I would feel sad for them in

851
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,560
using this kind of stuff you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can find</font>

852
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,120
automated trades if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see basically</font>

853
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,649
like anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens of a certain</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">amount and a certain like in a fixed</font>

855
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:21,220
time period<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can find stuff like that</font>

856
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,800
and you can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin tumblers which</font>

857
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,180
is just people trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hide where they</font>

858
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:29,230
got their<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin from some like that</font>

859
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:32,290
and of course most<font color="#E5E5E5"> importantly who the</font>

860
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:37,000
fuck has my 15 million dollars so I

861
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:41,860
asked my system show me transactions

862
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:46,210
that took place in February and give me

863
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:48,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the biggest ones and I did not find a 15</font>

864
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:49,570
million dollar transaction the closest

865
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:52,090
that i found was a transaction that at

866
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:55,030
the time was worth about<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight million</font>

867
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:58,090
dollars it was four days<font color="#CCCCCC"> before said</font>

868
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:59,980
tweet it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it may have gone</font>

869
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:02,800
into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tumblr the day that it was bought</font>

870
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,660
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know it jumps around a lot</font>

871
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,409
and is systematically cut in half a lot

872
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,630
I high Lee

873
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:09,250
and then you pull this up at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

874
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:10,780
and look it up because you can see for

875
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,150
yourself it exhibits some strange

876
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,710
behavior but it may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tumbler it may</font>

877
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:16,150
be some legitimate behavior that i don't

878
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">know about so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know that it went</font>

879
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:20,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">into a tumblr</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i used it it's moving</font>

880
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,790
around a lot in a programmatic way this

881
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:24,310
is where it actually came from I cannot

882
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:25,690
confirm<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's going into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a tumblr I</font>

883
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:27,909
cannot confirm<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's the</font>

884
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:31,240
transaction that he was referencing I

885
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:32,800
have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea but there was no 15 million</font>

886
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,680
dollar transaction this was the closest

887
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing I pulled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it up here you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can look</font>

888
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,520
at it this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a misnomer it says 13</font>

889
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,400
million dollars but blockchain<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot info</font>

890
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">calculates what the value would be today</font>

891
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:47,020
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> value at that time was about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 8</font>

892
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:48,430
million dollars so then of course the

893
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,440
question it's obviously it would be

894
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,880
logical to ask well what happens if the

895
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,500
transaction was<font color="#E5E5E5"> split into multiple</font>

896
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,570
smaller transactions what happened if

897
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,160
there were 15 1 million dollar

898
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:59,409
transactions that happened to the same

899
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,910
wallet this would trigger this we'd

900
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:04,690
avoid triggering the analytic that I

901
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:08,260
just built so I built a query show me

902
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:10,240
the top 50 wallets that received<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

903
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,100
most money and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i ended up oh this is</font>

904
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">nasty sorry the formatting got screwed</font>

905
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,880
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> i ended up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a lot of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

906
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:17,739
were really big but when i actually

907
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,030
ended up digging in and investigating

908
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:20,709
them all of these wallets have existed

909
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:23,260
for quite some time and they have a high

910
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:25,389
cash flow a high like<font color="#CCCCCC"> bitcoin flow so</font>

911
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:28,900
they were getting bitcoin moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> bitcoin</font>

912
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:30,850
very quickly but i did find one specific

913
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:35,860
transaction that happened two days after

914
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:40,750
the tweet that was about was about<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

915
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:42,250
think 14 million dollars at the time but

916
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:45,310
that was after the tweet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know</font>

917
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:46,480
it but it did receive yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

918
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:51,969
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually go back and look at</font>

919
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:55,570
that so then kind of came to how do I

920
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:57,009
make this thing better so some of the

921
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:58,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">things left for me to do on this system</font>

922
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">is I actually want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to open up like maybe</font>

923
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">a public website to allow anybody to ask</font>

924
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,730
any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these queries that they want</font>

925
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,950
maybe build a<font color="#CCCCCC"> front-end for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it I don't</font>

926
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:09,760
know the right way to do it in terms of

927
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:11,290
architecture is not to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-time etl</font>

928
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,880
of the data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> shove it in the right</font>

929
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,320
way to do it is to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a blockchain</font>

930
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,980
minor something that sits<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the network</font>

931
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:22,070
that just flows into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the database</font>

932
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,900
I really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of missed out using that</font>

933
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:27,710
graph databases for this which would

934
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:29,270
have made a ton of sense but I i did

935
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,350
that wasn't how<font color="#CCCCCC"> i ended up doing it it's</font>

936
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,700
something that's kind of left on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

937
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,680
list but graph databases would help me

938
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,689
find relationships better and stuff like

939
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,740
that and my parser sucks so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got to</font>

940
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:40,430
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a little bit better but that's</font>

941
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:41,899
because i suck at writing code it would

942
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,520
be really<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool to watch everybody like</font>

943
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,840
watch what happens to<font color="#E5E5E5"> coins when they</font>

944
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,180
get donated somebody because that's nice

945
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:49,280
because you actually get a label at some

946
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,618
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the data you know that coins</font>

947
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,380
that go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> WikiLeaks donation link are</font>

948
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:55,730
then held by WikiLeaks or whatever it

949
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be cool to write some analytics</font>

950
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:59,869
signatures to figure out when<font color="#CCCCCC"> things go</font>

951
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,270
into known tumblers it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

952
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:05,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">signature tumblers because tumblers our</font>

953
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:07,310
programmatic their software some are

954
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:09,950
better than others some tumblers have

955
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:16,700
like jitter so some will move transact

956
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:18,169
move money on like a on a not on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fixed</font>

957
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,910
schedule but instead they'll move them

958
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:22,070
around kind of erratically to look like

959
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:23,270
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to build an API for this</font>

960
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:25,220
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now everything's just</font>

961
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:26,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">straight up database queries and in the</font>

962
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,950
learning engine would be kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool</font>

963
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:30,770
like have like uh let me like send<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a</font>

964
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:32,868
text when the when this much money moves

965
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:35,060
this place or when this wallet does this

966
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:36,290
thing or whatever there's a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

967
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">different use cases for this kind of</font>

968
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:38,450
thing I mean I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like maybe law</font>

969
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,000
enforcement our intelligence community

970
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:43,069
people for investigation investigative

971
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,520
purposes I don't know fintech kind of

972
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:47,900
stuff like just having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good grasp on</font>

973
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money that's actually</font>

974
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,440
moving every day how it's changing how

975
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:53,210
it can be correlated with other stuff so

976
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,100
with investments stuff like that feel

977
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,600
like hedge funds and currency exchanges

978
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,700
would have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of benefit with this</font>

979
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,470
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's some it's a</font>

980
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:03,710
stretch but anti-money laundering use

981
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:06,230
cases for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and then there's the evil</font>

982
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:07,760
ones like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can find well I guess that's</font>

983
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:10,100
not that evil but I can like find people

984
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,080
like I can try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify people making</font>

985
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,339
evil making purchases in the dark net

986
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,740
which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit harder than it</font>

987
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,510
sounds I can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as a targeting</font>

988
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:19,310
platform to find rich people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> steal</font>

989
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:21,200
their money or<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could violate people's</font>

990
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:24,259
privacy that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really make a lot</font>

991
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,529
of sense here so to conclude I guess

992
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:29,690
what I did is like the block chains cool

993
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:31,580
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool the way the data</font>

994
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:32,320
structure the way the data is structured

995
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">kays</font>

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,230
really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for validating integrity and</font>

997
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,420
making sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything is</font>

00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:39,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">rock-solid but there's no way to ask it</font>

999
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:41,260
the kinds of questions that I wanted to

1000
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask it so I built basically just a</font>

1001
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,470
little teeny you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> even call it a</font>

1002
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,390
search engine that just allows you to

1003
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask more intelligent questions of the</font>

1004
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:50,560
blockchain to get more intelligent

1005
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,030
responses i did this based on a post

1006
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,070
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw to try to figure out if I</font>

1007
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:57,490
could identify something that happened

1008
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:59,110
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a poster in a tweet and tried to</font>

1009
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:01,990
correlate it to some ground truth that

1010
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:04,030
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the on the ledger itself and</font>

1011
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:06,339
identified a number of transactions I

have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea if any of those are him no</font>

1013
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:11,770
clue<font color="#CCCCCC"> but i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do know to answer the</font>

1014
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:14,650
question if anyone moved 15 million

dollars at that given point in time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1016
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:19,060
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not observe it I did not see one</font>

1017
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:21,910

1018
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:23,650
to a single wallet that were 15 million

1019
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:25,270
dollars at the time is my time range off

1020
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:26,380
I don't know there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of details</font>

1021
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:28,930
that I'm missing but i do know in that

1022
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:30,730
period<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time i did not actually see a</font>

1023
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:33,580
15 million dollar transaction i did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1024
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:34,990
observe it I don't feel like that I'm d

1025
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:37,600
anonymizing blockchain somebody asked me

1026
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:39,399
about that a week ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't you worried</font>

1027
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,319
about d anonymizing blockchain not

1028
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,050
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because if you think about</font>

1029
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,730
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> google was d anonymizing if you use</font>

1030
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,900
that logic google was d anonymizing the

1031
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,490
internet when they built their search

1032
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,440
engine the data is already there so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1033
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:53,620
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really feel like I'm screwing with</font>

1034
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,850
anybody's and humidity there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

1035
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:57,580
other people doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a lot better</font>

1036
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:58,660
than me I have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's good for</font>

1037
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,430
people to kind of think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1038
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,870
kinds of things when they write<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

1039
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:03,850
or when they make transactions it is

1040
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,990
important to know that any transaction

1041
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,759
that you make on the blockchain ledger

1042
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:08,680
is going to be recorded<font color="#E5E5E5"> forever and</font>

1043
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,650
everyone can see it it's harder to

1044
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:13,720
figure out who owns a wallet but it is

1045
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:15,250
certainly possible that everyone that

1046
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,560
people are going to write analytics like

1047
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:19,750
this for whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose so this</font>

1048
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,180
database allows us to ask any question

1049
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,650
of the blockchain it allows us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

1050
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,509
out who has the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> one's point Bitcoin</font>

1051
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:27,460
where is the Bitcoin at who has the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font>

1052
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:29,170
money how much money was spent in a day

1053
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,280
what is the average money allows you to

1054
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:31,660
correlate with stuff like the stock

1055
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,450
market<font color="#E5E5E5"> it allows you to correlate with</font>

1056
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:38,410
stuff like current events<font color="#CCCCCC"> or any other</font>

1057
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:43,169
economic issues and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it</font>

1058
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:53,609
oh crap anybody have any questions yes

1059
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:57,059
Oh two things for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time stamps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guest</font>

1060
00:39:53,609 --> 00:40:00,210
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all how detailed how in depth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does go</font>

1061
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:02,160
nano second does it just curious so the

1062
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:04,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is do I repeat the question or</font>

1063
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,980
do people have the question I don't have

1064
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:10,400
to repeat the question so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time stamp</font>

1065
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:14,160
is in UNIX epoch time stamp which is

1066
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:17,369
seconds from when the block was mind

1067
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:19,470
that the transaction took place on so

1068
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:21,900
how precise i would give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a margin of</font>

1069
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:24,450
error of 15 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's the</font>

1070
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,920
average time period so it's harder to

1071
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:28,828
correlate exactly when it happened but

1072
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,650
it's you basically have about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15</font>

1073
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:32,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">minute window being read wrong and</font>

1074
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:35,010
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just what I because that's the</font>

1075
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:39,170
average time that it takes to have a new

1076
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:42,030
block oh it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 shit it's 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes</font>

1077
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:46,559
thank you and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> said you had another</font>

1078
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:49,170
question yeah um just does time zones

1079
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:51,900
like East like have anything to do with

1080
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:53,640
it so time zones do not have anything to

1081
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,280
do with it because the way the UNIX

1082
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,900
epoch timestamp works is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the</font>

1083
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,470
number of seconds that have taken place

1084
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:05,099
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> July first nineteen seventy look</font>

1085
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:07,410
so oh but I guess what did I just say

1086
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:09,510
july<font color="#E5E5E5"> January I'm sorry January first</font>

1087
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:15,950
nineteen seventy but I don't know what

1088
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:24,119
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> zone GM GM okay yeah gmt so second</font>

1089
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:26,308
it allows variance<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for when you</font>

1090
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:28,849
start mining<font color="#CCCCCC"> out like on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> block</font>

1091
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:28,849
dinner with the

1092
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:41,420
okay okay okay cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you cool thank</font>

1093
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:44,450
you yeah no<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem any other questions</font>

1094
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,580
yes so when you were showing the hex

1095
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:48,109
dump is it is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a like a you know</font>

1096
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,670
like looking at a packet header where

1097
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:51,020
you know these particular parts are

1098
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,460
addressed these particular gay so that's

1099
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,740
always static and you can perish<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1100
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,870
out could you then if you wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1101
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,669
track a specific persons transactions

1102
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:00,259
socially engineer them by just<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying</font>

1103
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:01,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know hey I heard about you losing</font>

1104
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,260
your 15 mil wanted to give you some

1105
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:08,770
bitcoins and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then now you've got their</font>

1106
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:11,600
address the query against them can you

1107
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:13,160
see you're saying aim like like tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font>

1108
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,779
you're donating to him because you feel

1109
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,730
bad for<font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> losing his 15 see what</font>

1110
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:18,500
address you just donated to and then use

1111
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:20,750
that to then run against his data to say

1112
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:25,790
who else took from or gave to this

1113
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:28,550
address um so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying just asking</font>

1114
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:30,529
him for his<font color="#CCCCCC"> bitcoin wallet I'll give you</font>

1115
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:33,320
some money yeah yeah you you could do

1116
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:36,080
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the thing is it's the it's</font>

1117
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:38,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">trivial to introduce new Bitcoin wallets</font>

1118
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,250
so it's it's you don't have to reuse and

1119
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,540
it's actually best practice to use lots

1120
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,670
of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin wallets for</font>

1121
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:49,279
anonymity and<font color="#E5E5E5"> omit whatever purpose is</font>

1122
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:51,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thank you a new a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1123
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,630
every transaction yeah is the right way

1124
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:55,819
to do it best practice according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1125
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:58,010
experts yes it's based on that question

1126
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,810
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like a known attack vector that</font>

1127
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,790
I guess the darknet operators look out

1128
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,650
for and it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> where somebody</font>

1129
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,990
gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> does transactions I'll few</font>

1130
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:07,640
Satoshi's so that you can pin that

1131
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:09,229
address and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see where the money flows so</font>

1132
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,420
where it ends up so there's like

1133
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:14,780
complicated addresses that take out like

1134
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:17,390
basically tainted inputs and basically

1135
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,860
let those not move out because like<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

1136
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:22,220
you saw the inputs and outputs where

1137
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:23,990
it's basically by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Satoshi Satoshi's love</font>

1138
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,160
like basically how many Satoshi's were

1139
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:26,540
in there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

1140
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,460
basically spam the network with

1141
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:33,170
Satoshi's yeah hopefully being able to

1142
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:34,790
track it and then I yeah the base 58 was

1143
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:37,880
basically so you could double-click the

1144
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:39,080
address and then be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to copy and</font>

1145
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,520
paste it without it breaking with

1146
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,759
punctuation that makes so much sense

1147
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,288
yeah that makes so much sense

1148
00:43:43,759 --> 00:43:47,029
figured it was either that or something

1149
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:49,249
with the QR codes<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're like may be cute</font>

1150
00:43:47,029 --> 00:43:51,829
but that yeah yeah it was basically that

1151
00:43:49,249 --> 00:43:53,598
and I I I don't know why I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

1152
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:55,699
this too but I don't remember exactly

1153
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,949
the copy and paste I do was so when you

1154
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:59,509
had capital o's like you didn't you had

1155
00:43:57,949 --> 00:44:02,149
lower case and no<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero so you don't</font>

1156
00:43:59,509 --> 00:44:03,829
confuse them oh yeah sure so it was like

1157
00:44:02,149 --> 00:44:06,019
back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original design but it is a</font>

1158
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:08,059
pain to work with yeah then there's this

1159
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:09,649
project out there called blocks ear that

1160
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:13,099
does like something similar but with

1161
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:15,439
graphical relationships yeah yeah input

1162
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:17,539
outputs<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then my question was</font>

1163
00:44:15,439 --> 00:44:20,239
how big was the actual data set after

1164
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:22,069
you put it in the database so like that

1165
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:24,439
how big was it on disc after it was in

1166
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:26,329
the database yeah like<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much did the</font>

1167
00:44:24,439 --> 00:44:28,009
database reduce it yeah like how what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1168
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:29,569
the size of like the database like yours

1169
00:44:28,009 --> 00:44:32,299
if you were to basically focus on

1170
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:34,639
keeping it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a chain or sorry like it's</font>

1171
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:37,489
basically what's the current status of

1172
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:40,009
it yeah I model like how big is that I

1173
00:44:37,489 --> 00:44:42,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know I remember it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being very</font>

1174
00:44:40,009 --> 00:44:45,169
close to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the size of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the CSV the actual</font>

1175
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:47,089
so the database<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I used didn't seem</font>

1176
00:44:45,169 --> 00:44:50,868
to compress it at all or do anything

1177
00:44:47,089 --> 00:44:52,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically i had an 80 gig</font>

1178
00:44:50,869 --> 00:44:54,409
see us right at 100 gig<font color="#E5E5E5"> csv and when I</font>

1179
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:56,449
loaded it in and I looked<font color="#CCCCCC"> at that</font>

1180
00:44:54,409 --> 00:44:57,919
directory as it was loading and I have

1181
00:44:56,449 --> 00:44:59,929
to get back to you on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Scientifics but I</font>

1182
00:44:57,919 --> 00:45:01,759
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> it being about the same sizes</font>

1183
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:04,699
do you remember it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was it less than the</font>

1184
00:45:01,759 --> 00:45:06,139
full 80 gigs I don't remember I I have

1185
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:08,209
to yeah I'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look why</font>

1186
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:09,949
just curious yeah yeah I know there's

1187
00:45:08,209 --> 00:45:11,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">other stuff like I mean Cassandra would</font>

1188
00:45:09,949 --> 00:45:14,209
reduce the crap out of it if you if you

1189
00:45:11,899 --> 00:45:15,979
like really<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you had really rigid data</font>

1190
00:45:14,209 --> 00:45:17,269
types and stuff like that but click

1191
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:18,828
house I didn't have as much experience

1192
00:45:17,269 --> 00:45:22,999
with and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tried to read a lot of</font>

1193
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:24,499
the docks it's mostly in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russian so like</font>

1194
00:45:22,999 --> 00:45:26,178
I would go and I'm like I like search

1195
00:45:24,499 --> 00:45:29,238
like is there compression and I find

1196
00:45:26,179 --> 00:45:31,429
like one google talk post<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a bunch of</font>

1197
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:32,989
rational<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know where they yes</font>

1198
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:34,279
another ring to another Russian for hang

1199
00:45:32,989 --> 00:45:36,559
on with fucking this means man you're

1200
00:45:34,279 --> 00:45:37,489
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not helping but yeah yes so is</font>

1201
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,369
there anything in the block chain

1202
00:45:37,489 --> 00:45:42,049
protocol or whatever to stop like maybe

1203
00:45:40,369 --> 00:45:44,059
me having<font color="#E5E5E5"> two wallets and just</font>

1204
00:45:42,049 --> 00:45:46,249
transferring one Satoshi back and forth

1205
00:45:44,059 --> 00:45:49,939
there is a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a transfer fee</font>

1206
00:45:46,249 --> 00:45:54,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so the way the way that works is</font>

1207
00:45:49,939 --> 00:45:55,459
basically this is going to get into a

1208
00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:56,828
lot of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff but basically there's</font>

1209
00:45:55,459 --> 00:45:59,049
a finite amount of Bitcoin

1210
00:45:56,829 --> 00:46:00,969
can be mined and eventually when all of

1211
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:04,029
those by design eventually when all of

1212
00:46:00,969 --> 00:46:06,009
those Bitcoin our mind the Bitcoin

1213
00:46:04,029 --> 00:46:08,640
network will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be powered and Bitcoin</font>

1214
00:46:06,009 --> 00:46:12,579
miners will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> rewarded specifically by</font>

1215
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:15,160
fees<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sophia transaction fee is extracted</font>

1216
00:46:12,579 --> 00:46:17,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">from every transaction and it pulls</font>

1217
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:20,019
together to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> then reward the</font>

1218
00:46:17,469 --> 00:46:23,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">miner once coin basis are gone and once</font>

1219
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:25,089
like the ones mining new Bitcoin once

1220
00:46:23,229 --> 00:46:26,828
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Bitcoin are in circulation so to</font>

1221
00:46:25,089 --> 00:46:28,109
answer your question<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes there is</font>

1222
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:34,809
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> preventing you from doing that</font>

1223
00:46:28,109 --> 00:46:35,859
cool any other questions no I'm done my
