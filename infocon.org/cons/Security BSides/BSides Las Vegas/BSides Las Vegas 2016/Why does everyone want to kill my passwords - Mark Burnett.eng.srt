00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,710
of the very acclaimed book perfect

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,120
passwords I was actually considering to

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,610
bring in here to Las Vegas to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:20,789
personally signed I still have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:24,448

8
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:27,029

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,590
tormenting your family over<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I am ok</font>

10
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,320
yeah time so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's gonna be</font>

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,329
very interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to listen what's he</font>

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:38,960
ever actually be done in doing so mark

13
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:44,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">your free dude</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kassad all right ok um</font>

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:48,510
I'm Mark Burnett I guess hi MA I I did

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,339
stuff and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about stuff so but on</font>

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:57,570
my first slide here i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read my</font>

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:59,760
intro ok so this talk is about passwords

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,109
and killing passwords and really the

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,510
mess we've made with the whole password

20
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,670
thing because although we like to think

21
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:09,539
that we have played a part<font color="#CCCCCC"> in making the</font>

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:13,350
world more secure mostly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've done</font>

23
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,180
is alienate users we've made them log

24
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,600
into everything over and over and over

25
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">and over and over we tell them to make</font>

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure the password is really strong but</font>

27
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,240
don't write it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and of course don't</font>

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">forget it be sure to add some special</font>

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:31,250
characters or sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it's a bank</font>

30
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:38,280
don't include special characters banks

31
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:47,850
we bombarded users with I gotta change

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:50,909
my screen here the NIP bombarded use it

33
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:55,020
with a never-ending supply of policies

34
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:57,450
CAPTCHAs remember me boxes on behind now

35
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,460
and of course you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't check</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

36
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,750
Remember Me box even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

37
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,759
everywhere and of course usually

38
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,540
retaliated how they know best with memes

39
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,610
and you know we can't blame them because

40
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,140
we created them we recreated those

41
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:19,159
monsters and they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> monsters</font>

42
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:21,929
but I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> got this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little analogy here</font>

43
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:34,078
actually I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw this video has got</font>

44
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find a way to work it in we are all</font>

45
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:41,579
losing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know i don't</font>

46
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,150
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you notice it it's kind of quick</font>

47
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:46,560
but um i watch around<font color="#E5E5E5"> this year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

48
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,079
going to zoom in and it slowed down but

49
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,220
watch around<font color="#E5E5E5"> this area because there was</font>

50
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:56,579
something just kind of went by real

51
00:02:50,220 --> 00:03:02,040
quick there you probably missed on the

52
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:03,900
first time so<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so we've been</font>

53
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,909
doing passwords for several decades now

54
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,760
and you think we've pretty much got<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

55
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:09,959
figured out right but<font color="#CCCCCC"> but let's let's</font>

56
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,798
look at what we've accomplished and

57
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:17,069
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of do a report card here</font>

58
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:19,650
password policies seemed<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

59
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:22,948
idea but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it turns out we really</font>

60
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,720
don't know what works I mean users<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

61
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:27,180
bad passwords so hey let's force that

62
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,510
bit passwords but that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of end up</font>

63
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,760
with not enough requirements too many

64
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:36,120
requirements strange requirements no no

65
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:40,280
two identical consecutive characters and

66
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:43,349
I don't know if you know me on twitter i

67
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,230
complained by a lot of stuff short pass

68
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:56,220
for explanations policies for policies I

69
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:58,198
mean come<font color="#CCCCCC"> on failed user education you</font>

70
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,569
know they're still confused with as much

71
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,150
as we've we've tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> there they still</font>

72
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:04,918
suck at passwords they still hate

73
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,049
passwords they still want to kill

74
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,549
passwords they're always trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font>

75
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,639
some some way to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> around their</font>

76
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:14,000
passwords so we're going to fail on that

77
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">too</font>

78
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:22,770
password manager hey now I know we've

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,090
talked a lot about password managers and

80
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:29,969
it's kind of important thing to a lot of

81
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:32,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">people here a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of person here but you</font>

82
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,690
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got to face it they're just a</font>

83
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,600
temporary fix they're really not a

84
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:41,310
long-term solution they kind of tacking

85
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,540
on to tacking on to this problem we have

86
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:48,080
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> password and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix</font>

87
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,080
passwords by having password manager but

88
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:55,740
yeah Hardware tokens hey no talk

89
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,620
Hardware tokens we're doing for decades

90
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">now I mean we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

91
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and we've tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of different</font>

92
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:04,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">things but the thing is I've ever tried</font>

93
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,229
to get someone to use a hardware token

94
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,359
who isn't in the security business or

95
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:12,960
Leslie you know the company forces them

96
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:20,430
to you know it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just doesn't happen and</font>

97
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:25,500
there's that now biometrics hey users

98
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:27,870
like those fingerprints I scanner is

99
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,880
voice matching you know movies have been

100
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,680
doing it for years it looks cool seems

101
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,419
really secure I mean you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if I</font>

102
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,880
mean if it's something really secure

103
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:36,930
they're going to voice match right but

104
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,729
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still haven't figured out</font>

105
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,050
how to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> made</font>

106
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:41,609
forget make it secure and we haven't

107
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,450
figured out how to make it anonymous and

108
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:50,370
we haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to make it</font>

109
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:52,650
work everywhere yeah oh I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

110
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:57,260
sound I just realized the house cool pop

111
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,260

118
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,340
an article about killing passwords and

119
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,410
they thought you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it was gets a</font>

154
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,560

00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:23,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">it so it can't be frustrating these be</font>

203
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,670
flexible needs to work across a lot of

204
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">different platforms now we get it</font>

205
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,390
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cool authentication</font>

206
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,670
stuff but only works on windows or it

207
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,770
only works on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your mobile so it's got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

208
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,849
work on different platforms it's got to

209
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,860
be compatible<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font>

210
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication technologies I mean</font>

211
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,000
windows hellos nice but it lost stuff

212
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:46,530
you can't use it you can't use a you be

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:51,250
key to log into windows hello it's got a

214
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:53,800
its got to be invisible it's a user and

215
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,940
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they just really got to feel</font>

216
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,170
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it i mean</font>

217
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,520
that's that's the biggest problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

218
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,800
passwords aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're far from this</font>

219
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,170
invisible they they're struggling with

220
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,410
them all the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean just just</font>

221
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,150
monitor the key word password on<font color="#E5E5E5"> twitter</font>

222
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,920
and yes silloth it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of funny but</font>

223
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:12,610
you see all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of complaints about</font>

224
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:15,520
passwords and it's got to be ubiquitous

225
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">i mean if your bank sent a sends you one</font>

226
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,790
token the only works with their with

227
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,959
their website what's the point of that

228
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,849
it's got to be something that you can

229
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,470
you can use on all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

230
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,360
websites or all the different systems or

231
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,860
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> works on websites but not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

232
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">less or vice versa I mean it's gotta be</font>

233
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,830
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that works across</font>

234
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,160
different systems

235
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:34,480
so with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> in mind you know I decided</font>

236
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,719
to take to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the extreme okay didn't work</font>

237
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,940
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> my family but I thought I tried</font>

238
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,650
myself I mean I'm pretty brave so I I

239
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,330
got all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff to get I had a few</font>

240
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:46,720
more things my keychain I got this you

241
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:49,720
know there's that I track her and you

242
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I installed it all my system I</font>

243
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,690
system really doesn't boot and very well

244
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:59,800
anymore but but I did I installed it all

245
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:01,450
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I um you know I tried it</font>

246
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like what you know what are we doing</font>

247
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:09,220
wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> here I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean what am I why isn't</font>

248
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:11,920
this so hard to figure out and just to

249
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,600
be clear we're going to killing

250
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,300
passwords anytime soon you guys know I'm

251
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,600
just skip that one so let's talk about

252
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,219
password managers I said there are

253
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,280
temporary fix they're just kind of a

254
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,650
crutch to get us through to make

255
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,449
passwords usable for now I mean it may

256
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,800
be 10 years maybe 20 years but they're

257
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:36,460
really not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to last it's not a</font>

258
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:38,380
long-term solution here I mean we don't

259
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,120
know our own secrets i mean we create

260
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,189
these least we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even create the</font>

261
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,440
secrets that generates a password for us

262
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,170
it manages the the secret for us it

263
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,610
enters the demand for us but it's not

264
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">just kind of breaks the whole security</font>

265
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,060
model breaks a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little concept</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of having</font>

266
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,829
a secret<font color="#E5E5E5"> because yeah we have this this</font>

267
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,890
master password but it's not really way

268
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,720
this is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and we just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got to</font>

269
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at that look at passwords there are</font>

270
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,330
transitions or should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> there to get us</font>

271
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:09,910
to this place where we can we truly have

272
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:11,020
a seamless system where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're you know</font>

273
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,730
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing more than just typing in</font>

274
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:16,110
static passwords you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tulus type</font>

275
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,110
type in sac passwords for us

276
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,780
sorry but to get that to get to that

277
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,940
place we're going to have to get

278
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,560
operating system support we're gonna

279
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:29,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to get browser support I know that</font>

280
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,910
was my quest now yeah he thinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

281
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,080
browser shouldn't be involved but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

282
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,160
know you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the operating says</font>

283
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,890
you gotta have the OS<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's got to be</font>

288
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,020
have the browser involved if we don't

289
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,220
have the operating system<font color="#CCCCCC"> volved we're</font>

290
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,140
just not going to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it's</font>

291
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:50,290
just we have to the only way we're going

292
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:53,880
to do that is to get every component

293
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:55,839
integrated and so who's going to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

294
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,910
not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> search who's gonna do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

295
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:03,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">asking for volunteers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no okay okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

296
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,750
what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing this for</font>

297
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,640
a long time we've got we've tried

298
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:10,240
magnetic stripe cards we've tried smart

299
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,620
cards token generators all kinds of

300
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,360
technologies and that's what users want

301
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,220
they want something it's easy something

302
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,750
is plug in or or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just be near a</font>

303
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:20,950
computer unlocks it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if you lose it</font>

304
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,270
you you've got this thing Galaga if you

305
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,280
lose you grab another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

306
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,329
your thing and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> log in and</font>

307
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,180
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose that thing and you get another</font>

308
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:30,460
thing so you know that's that seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

309
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:34,540
a great solution but you know hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

310
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,950
the classic trade-off between hard work

311
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,099
the classic trade-off between security

312
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,450
and convenience and you know what seems

313
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:49,720
great for users<font color="#E5E5E5"> really doesn't work well</font>

314
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:55,360
for security soap and vice versa but you

315
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:58,330
miss them let me do it again for you so

316
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,030
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2005 a lot of websites realize</font>

317
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,560
they need to do Lydia thing to make

318
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:05,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">things more secure so we started like</font>

319
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,719
paypal and ebay and some banks they

320
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:10,030
started distributing these these vasco

321
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,980
go tokens you know you push the button

322
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,360
it gives a six digit code and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

323
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,830
really like these every night I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

324
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,870
these for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years and the battery still</font>

325
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:19,300
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still use them on my paypal</font>

326
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,980
account but I guess they really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

327
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,569
thought for the for the companies

328
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,730
because they just you know they kind of

329
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:28,060
it got to where they pay pal just kind

330
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:30,330
of hit that that feature for a while it

331
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:34,170
must have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a major sport headache so</font>

332
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,170
we couldn't what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

333
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:45,360
exactly nobody use them but me and like

334
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:48,399
you probably and like some other guy so

335
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bluetooth now a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth interesting</font>

336
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,300
because people are always trying to I

337
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,470
mean Luke to seems like the perfect way

338
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,810
to do this you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

339
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:58,990
touch it just go near your computer it

340
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:01,029
unlocks<font color="#CCCCCC"> its but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not exactly secure</font>

341
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:03,550
I mean you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always on you know it's</font>

342
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:05,259
easily spoof able it's visible I mean

343
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,599
within 30 feet or more if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a if</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a I mean sometimes I've seen</font>

antenna vulnerable to man the middle

347
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,660
attack i think there's going to talk at

348
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,860
DEFCON about that but we keep you know

349
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:22,810
keep put everyone keeps going back to

350
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:24,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">this these blue to stuff and the</font>

351
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:27,008
protocol is insecure there's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

352
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:29,258
no fixing that unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless we fix the</font>

353
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:31,029
protocol but one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do is you</font>

354
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:32,769
treat it like it's an insecure network

355
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:34,779
and we know how to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> in secure</font>

00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:38,709
networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean you you have proper key</font>

detect the presence of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth</font>

360
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,069
market or as you you exchange you do a

361
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,470
proper challenge response you exchange a

markers<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean sent this one's got a</font>

390
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:11,770
heart rate sensor you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font>

391
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,960
there's done authentication through

heart rate it's got microphones on it

393
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,830
you can do voice authentications got

394
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,830
galvanic sensors you know it's basically

395
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,120
got a lie detector test on here not a

397
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">different possibilities I mean you could</font>

398
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:29,410
you could if you really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

399
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,030
that work I mean wearables are really

405
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:51,700
you push a button gatekeeper now this

406
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,340
one's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting I don't</font>

419
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:25,209
want logging with just the gatekeeper or

420
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,440
with a pin or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just really</font>

went<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication so I saw this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

429
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:52,250
saw this and it was just bad

430
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:55,280
I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you can see here vice</font>

432
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,780
there's the call the code for encrypting

433
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,010
it and yeah it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean it's</font>

434
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of sad because that was kind of</font>

435
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,590
cool I know I've worked with I'm we've

436
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,080

437
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,610
they're improving that but it's you know

438
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's that there's a lot of potential</font>

439
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,178
there are something some way we can go

440
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:15,440
without you know some bluetooth device

441
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:17,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's pretty seamless for the user</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

442
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,620
bikies right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we all like leave a</font>

which one

447
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:56,570
the 40 well it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how I mean</font>

448
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,490
what kind of crypto you're talking about

449
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:00,889
because there are i mean the<font color="#E5E5E5"> yuki is</font>

451
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:05,779
you can write your own java modules in

452
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:08,210
there so i guess it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what</font>

453
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:11,960
you're using for but you know it depends

454
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:13,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">on how your how you're using it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:19,100
closest to to getting a real hardware

457
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:20,899
token it's usable it's cheap you too you

458
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,330
too f standard a few of those you to

459

501
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:18,199
you can't change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's just a code I</font>

502
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,730
mean it's spoof able it's easily copied

503
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,560
you can't turn it off so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not like</font>

504
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,420
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth I may at least blue to it</font>

505
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,399
you can kind of secure it by only turn

506
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:31,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">on when you need it you need a reader</font>

507
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:36,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you know those readers but I don't</font>

508
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:39,949
know what that is oh so I used event

509
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:41,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">ghosts in Windows i used the realest</font>

510
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,490
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i use tasker and kind of got all</font>

511
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,720
the stuff integrated it worked out

512
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,550
pretty well and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool but</font>

513
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,650
it's just not secure at all I mean might

514
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:53,450
work for home users than that I don't

515
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:55,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">know just don't do this I mean unless</font>

516
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:58,250
you got some foil gloves or something

517
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,530
because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know once someone I mean</font>

518
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,760
it's spoof legislation sees someone

519
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,080
scans it and you've lost it you gotta

520
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,120
like what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you pull it out and put</font>

521
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,750
anyone in and you can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> change it</font>

522
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:14,479
and that's worse than your fingerprint

523
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:16,460
mobile devices some some based on Google

524
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,620
off maybe there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them some are</font>

525
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,230
proprietary simi's algorithm some these

526
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">personal custom algorithms somebody's</font>

527
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,410
push<font color="#CCCCCC"> notifications some use a</font>

528
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,090
combination of that those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things they're</font>

529
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:28,910
really contour easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> use everyone's got</font>

530
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:31,040
them some kind of mobile device people

531
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,390
are more willing to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

532
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,720
they're going to notice when it's gone

533
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:39,170
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be gone for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long the</font>

534
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,700
problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is they're vulnerable to</font>

535
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:42,980
remote attacks you could you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

536
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,420
some bad apt someone installs there's

537
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:48,260
they're slow to replace and you can't

538
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:49,690
just go get a new one on the plus side

539
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:52,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is a lot of support for</font>

540
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:55,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google ah i mean i've probably got 30 40</font>

541
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:58,750
on my google authenticator and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

542
00:24:55,179 --> 00:25:06,580
constantly growing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

543
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:08,440
that's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys get that so oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I forgot</font>

544
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:14,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it yeah that's that's what I call</font>

545
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:18,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">him what can be chopped off I kind of</font>

546
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:23,229
ran<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of graphics so I started using</font>

547
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:25,690
some stock photos so i guess thing is

548
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:28,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">with fingerprints finger</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here's my</font>

549
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:31,240
fingerprint scanner it's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> tiny</font>

550
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,279
one the problem with fingerprints and

551
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,269
this is the authentic they had oh they

552
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,220
had a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they were storing</font>

553
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:38,009
the password encryption what the way

554
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,970
that some of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> work is</font>

555
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:41,529
another reason why I said that was bad

556
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,720
news when they about a bad sign when

557
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:46,419
they ask you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your password though</font>

558
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,639
they'll encrypt your password and it has

559
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,740
some logic in the program that indicates

560
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:52,658
you and if you pass that's dedication

561
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:55,750
then they decrypt your password and use

562
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:57,070
that to log into windows and so that

563
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,389
just means your password stored

564
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:00,519
somewhere and most likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's got a</font>

565
00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:05,289
hard-coded key somewhere or based on

566
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:07,269
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> PIN and it's really cool it's built</font>

567
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:08,590
into windows you know but the thing is

568
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:10,419
you can't login to website your

569
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:11,379
fingerprint<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have you know</font>

570
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:12,759
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really much you can do with</font>

571
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:14,559
it and just log into windows that's why

572
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:19,539
there may be your<font color="#CCCCCC"> M</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your mobile phone as</font>

573
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:23,039
well and oh I risk no irises are

574
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:23,039
interesting I like this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best</font>

575
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:29,100
that camera<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just kind of weird I</font>

576
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:29,100
think

577
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:40,680
and this was my personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> favorite</font>

578
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:44,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I just worked really well it was</font>

579
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:49,950
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really seamless it's almost as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

580
00:26:44,130 --> 00:27:07,020
worked almost as well as the UH the

581
00:26:49,950 --> 00:27:10,140
bluetooth yeah okay so<font color="#E5E5E5"> me my kiss it</font>

582
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:13,830
says looking for you making sure it's

583
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:17,280
you it logs me in so it's kind of it's

584
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:21,689
kind of cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> I pass</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pictures I kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

585
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,980
freaky but<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah it's just I mean if we</font>

586
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:26,730
could get this something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that to</font>

587
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:28,110
work I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I said we get the OS</font>

588
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,400
support we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the browser support and</font>

589
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,600
then we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> application support but</font>

590
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,520
the thing is we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to walk in</font>

591
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:38,240
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to log into any websites with</font>

592
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:40,520
this so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not much look I</font>

593
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:45,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">should've got a big pitch i guess but</font>

594
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:46,680
there's really not much you can do with

595
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,479
it other than just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean oh you can</font>

596
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,930
play asteroids kind of cool you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you</font>

597
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,120
look at the asteroid in it blows it up

598
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:55,500
and some games but it's not much you can

599
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,010
do with other than that it's I mean it

600
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,840
would be nice if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could get that more</font>

601
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:02,070
commonplace but they aren't really cheap

602
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:07,709
has about one hundred eighty dollars for

603
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:10,020
this guy's to the cock up so they're all

604
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:13,470
catering people waiting outside yet take

605
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:17,280
over the room so I have to ask mark to

606
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:20,090
speak every five minutes five minutes k

607
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,090
acta de yeah

608
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:49,160
oh you give it away<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hayes voice fix</font>

609
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:50,979
don't ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for passwords if you ever do</font>

610
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,060
use a i could meet you cut biometric or

611
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:56,690
alternative indication you ask for your

612
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:59,030
password there's several of them that

613
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:03,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">did that it's just that you know they're</font>

614
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:06,350
storing it somewhere oh and there's this

615
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,690
thing I mean you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a class</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pass you</font>

616
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:10,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">can use you icky but if you lost lost</font>

617
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,230
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ubik you device click here to</font>

618
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,600
disable you<font color="#E5E5E5"> with key and then over here</font>

619
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:19,340
it says use email verification instead

620
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:21,050
so it's just kind of I why not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

621
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,909
e-mail verification in the first place I

622
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:25,850
mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not any stronger than</font>

623
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:28,160
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> weakest think they're so expanding</font>

624
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:31,159
modalities<font color="#CCCCCC"> well we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go back to fix</font>

625
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,880
fixing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you start strong work</font>

626
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:36,020
backwards we allow a lot of different

627
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">allow support for a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

628
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:41,240
types authentication don't I mean these

629
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:43,690
lot of these like LastPass for example

630
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,680
it lists you know these these certain

631
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:50,390
two-factor authentication things you can

632
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:51,530
use you know if they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

633
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> available on every device</font>

634
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:55,850
for for every person I mean not everyone

635
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:57,680
has fingerprints I mean you know it's

636
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:59,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">just you got to have flexibility based</font>

637
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,330
on where the user is what kind of ice

638
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:04,130
are using where they're logging in from

639
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:06,500
and other factors<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

640
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:08,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">could make it potentially suspicious so</font>

641
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">you kind of take away you know is this</font>

642
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:12,680
suspicious you try to take the score

643
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:13,790
away then you add on with this the

644
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,930
stronger authentication factor is

645
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,370
determined to get you back to up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

646
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:20,000
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to be you know to a</font>

647
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:21,770
certain score to to pass them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here's</font>

648
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,140
some kind of testing things that you

649
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:29,290
could look at where you where where you

650
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:31,580
are when are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> there where you were</font>

651
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:33,889
which device you're using who you know

652
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:35,529
who is with you but I hear something you

653
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:38,360
probably don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to use</font>

654
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:44,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">um something you forgot something you</font>

655
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:46,789
lost anyway something<font color="#CCCCCC"> UAE's how'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

656
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,850
bleed so I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys might want</font>

657
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:54,259
to use the hashtag and kind of carry

658
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:56,748
that on but rules based authentication

659
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:59,090
of that's one thing I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see I'd</font>

660
00:30:56,749 --> 00:31:01,340
like to see some kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean with uh</font>

661
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,418
with like within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the windows hello for</font>

662
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,580
example you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can log in with a</font>

663
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:06,799
fingerprint or with your face or you can

664
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:09,559
log in with your<font color="#CCCCCC"> pin code or password</font>

665
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,149
but would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be nice to say you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font>

666
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:13,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to log in with three of these three out</font>

667
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:15,498
of four or I want to say you know these

668
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,998
times I want to log in three or four if

669
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:18,350
i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's been more you</font>

670
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:21,080
know certain conditions<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would be nice</font>

671
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:22,998
to have a rules-based<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup that you can</font>

672
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,350
decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> either we could decide let us</font>

673
00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:25,899
have five different ways to authenticate

674
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,889
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> about three of them</font>

675
00:31:25,899 --> 00:31:29,350
artificial intelligence there's there's

676
00:31:27,889 --> 00:31:32,360
a lot of potential there for

677
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:34,399
understanding when to require multiple

678
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,350
factors or you know three or four

679
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,809
factors for authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> then if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

680
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:42,259
can't find devices some of the password

681
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:43,970
managers do that were already smarter

682
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:47,830
wearables that would be really cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

683
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:54,230
but are you okay and then there's this

684
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:58,460
that's it I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't have</font>

685
00:31:54,230 --> 00:32:01,419
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have questions have time</font>

686
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:04,340
for questions while they're setting up I

687
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:06,529
I was told they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are really eager</font>

688
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,178
together get in here but again you know

689
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:11,590
Mark would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> around so pleased you ask</font>

690
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:11,590
him questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside</font>
