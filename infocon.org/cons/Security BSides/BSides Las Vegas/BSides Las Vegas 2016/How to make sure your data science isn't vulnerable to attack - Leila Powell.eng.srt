00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">to take one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more opportunity to thank</font>

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,080
all our sponsors because we couldn't

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,630
make this happen without them please

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,330
visit their booths on the chill-out area

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,859
uh let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> see we're live streaming and</font>

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,028
recording this so please turn off your

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,590
cell phone rings<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot and please</font>

don't stand in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> banks it's a fire</font>

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:32,689
lane up next we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have Layla Powell who is</font>

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:45,180
a security data scientist at panacea

13
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:46,739
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright thanks so I'm sure</font>

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">many of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've heard the term data</font>

15
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,360
science appearing more and more in an

16
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,739
infosec context and at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment as we</font>

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">fear from others some other speakers</font>

18
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:58,379
already the focus currently seems to be

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,809
on machine learning now machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning</font>

20
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,710
is a great family of algorithms and can

21
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,729
be really powerful but that's all it is

22
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:09,060
unfortunately we seem at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment to</font>

23
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:11,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">be missing any coverage of the broader</font>

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,490
discipline of data science this can be

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,650
problematic for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of reasons</font>

26
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:19,110
first of all similar to the talk we

27
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,270
heard just before people can get taken

28
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">up by the the hype of advertising around</font>

29
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,560
machine learning and just think it's a

30
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,360
magic bullet for all their problems if

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,090
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand the work required</font>

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,750
before and after<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the solutions</font>

33
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,729
robust also people<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe think that they</font>

34
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,030
can just start applying machine learning

35
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,600
algorithms ad-hoc on data without the

36
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,770
experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> to handle the data properly</font>

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,020
but for the purpose of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk I want</font>

38
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,829
to focus on one of the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas which</font>

39
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:52,020
is the fact that we're not spending any

40
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,479
time looking at data science as a

41
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,210
discipline means that we're missing out

42
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,520
on some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the benefits applying the the</font>

43
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,939
the discipline of data science infosec

44
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,500
can actually bring in the last year<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

45
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,229
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with financial services</font>

46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,149
companies trying to help them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bake in</font>

47
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,360
a data science approach to their data

48
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,350
analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> in infosec in particular we've</font>

49
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,810
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help them</font>

50
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:20,609
with a couple of problems first of all

51
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:21,660
communicating the data it can be hard in

52
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">infra</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sexes lots of different</font>

53
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,359
stakeholders to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone to agree</font>

54
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what the truth of situation is and</font>

55
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,310
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that case you then lose trust in the</font>

56
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,609
data analysis so today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk to</font>

57
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:39,570
you about why data science is discipline

58
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:41,610
and what that involves and look at how

59
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,280
applying<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sciences discipline to</font>

60
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">infosec can tackle some the challenges</font>

61
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,090
that I've seen people<font color="#E5E5E5"> face over the last</font>

62
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:53,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">year okay so data sciences discipline</font>

63
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,050
essentially what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is it's</font>

64
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,549
a way of doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things there are</font>

65
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,680
principles that govern how you should do

66
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,860
stuff it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just a bunch of</font>

67
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,130
algorithms that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just throw it things</font>

68
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:07,860
data science like many professions is

69
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:09,390
often misunderstood people have one idea

70
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it but actually you get involved</font>

71
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,660
there's a lot more there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more to</font>

72
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,070
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i'm sure those of you that are</font>

73
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,070
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the infosec side in the audience</font>

74
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:21,480
can can sympathize with with this this

75
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:24,660
problem so let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

76
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:29,010
principles of data science I've broken

77
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:30,600
them down into into three areas and the

78
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,480
important thing here is that they all

79
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,420
build on top of one another so the first

80
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,220
one data exploration<font color="#CCCCCC"> and preparation is</font>

81
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:42,570
required as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a foundation for everything</font>

82
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,740
else that comes afterwards so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

83
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:47,100
to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more</font>

84
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:52,500
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> on each of these each of</font>

85
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:56,880
these areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay data exploration in</font>

86
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,680
preparation this involves a series of

87
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,030
principles first one is understanding

88
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,760
what questions can be answered by your

89
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,250
data set<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you take any set of</font>

90
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,989
numbers you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the distribution</font>

91
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,580
you can calculate<font color="#E5E5E5"> median you can do</font>

92
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,770
anything to it and some other numbers

93
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,090
will come out but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to understand</font>

94
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,890
what information is contained in the

95
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,798
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and whether the question you're</font>

96
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:20,010
asking can actually be answered the

97
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,260
second one is is the main knowledge this

98
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,849
was this was touched on in the first

99
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,219
talk this morning

100
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,600
and suggesting that sometimes secure a

101
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,150
data scientist working security might

102
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,650
luck the domain knowledge to do the work

103
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,289
but actually we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be getting this</font>

104
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,510
from the data if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we understand work with</font>

105
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,040
the data properly we can learn what we

106
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,110
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know to answer the questions</font>

107
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,840
from the data set but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be</font>

108
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">careful to do it thoroughly the next</font>

109
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">point is taking a look at the metadata</font>

110
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:51,750
so by this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just mean data about your</font>

111
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:53,880
data when we take a set of data say from

112
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,580
a database we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't just assume all of</font>

113
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,890
its valid we want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the time</font>

114
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,960
stamps governing when that data when

115
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,570
that record was updated where it came

116
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,280
from is it still valid now was<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was it</font>

117
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:09,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">relevant six months ago can we still use</font>

118
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:13,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">it next point is around quirks in the</font>

119
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,450
data at some point whichever database

120
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're you're reading from it were</font>

121
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,050
extracting data from was designed by

122
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,080
another human who might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not fall exactly</font>

123
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,390
like you do so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> your export data and</font>

124
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,770
start to work with it yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

125
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,260
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful not to make assumptions</font>

126
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:31,049
about how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is structured how</font>

127
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,550
it's updated how it's stored otherwise

128
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,030
you can lead to misunderstandings

129
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:39,270
misinterpretation then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to think</font>

130
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">about completeness this is a bit of</font>

131
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,539
slightly related to the first point what

132
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,789
questions can we answer we need to think

133
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,730
about if we're looking a population of

134
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:50,520
users or assets we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really think</font>

135
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how much how well that population</font>

136
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,169
is represented and the data set we have

137
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,270
if we only have ten percent of our

138
00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:00,570
assets in the data set any conclusions

139
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:02,430
we draw won't really be valuable and

140
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,950
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> our phone in simple stats in</font>

141
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,120
here I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> often</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> overlooked</font>

142
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,640
people often want to jump straight to

143
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,110
some really advanced algorithms but

144
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,300
actually if it's the first time you've

145
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:15,270
analyzed a data set for something beyond

146
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,070
its operational purpose so basic

147
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,930
statistics can be really valuable and

148
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,190
reveal quite a lot and you should

149
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably be doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway to check you</font>

150
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,550
understand kind of you have a feel for

151
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,940
your data before you start to do

152
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,940
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

153
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:31,960
the next area then<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data science is</font>

154
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:35,530
applying the algorithms now you will

155
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">have heard a lot of great talks it be</font>

156
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,698
sighs today and tomorrow around some of

157
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,080
the specific algorithms machine learning

00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">other stuff how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> act how these things</font>

159
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,460
actually work but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they I want to focus</font>

160
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,630
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the I said the discipline of data</font>

161
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,590
science and the things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be</font>

162
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,680
careful of when you apply these

163
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,880
algorithms the<font color="#CCCCCC"> main when I'd say is</font>

164
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,130
understanding which are algorithms

165
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,130
appropriate for first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all you're the</font>

166
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,750
data set you have so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

167
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">apply statistical</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tests or machine</font>

168
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,810
learning algorithm you need to think

169
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,719
what's my day to look like some<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

170
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">will will assume a normal distribution</font>

171
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,740
do you have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those if your dataset</font>

172
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:11,460
is skewed are you applying the right the

173
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,500
right machine learning algorithm to it

174
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,820
the next thing is is your use case what

175
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,449
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question you're trying to answer</font>

176
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,349
and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the appropriate al to</font>

177
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,620
provide you with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information answer</font>

178
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:27,370
that question this is particularly

179
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:30,250
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the scenario I'm</font>

180
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:32,889
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not doing data</font>

181
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,770
science as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a researcher but actually</font>

182
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:38,440
working with an infosec team in a

183
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,020
company so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't just look at stuff</font>

184
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,449
that's interesting we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

185
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,198
stuff that's useful so the use case and

186
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:46,259
what we're actually going to do with

187
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:48,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">that afterwards is really important and</font>

188
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:55,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">finally the thing we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> consider is</font>

189
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:57,430
the level of accuracy required so how

190
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,750
accurate a number is appropriate how

191
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,639
much time do we have to eat<font color="#CCCCCC"> up reach</font>

192
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,199
that solution we can't say will be

193
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,789
ninety percent accurate in six months

194
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:08,710
because the info SEC team are working

195
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:10,360
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs something of it sooner I'm</font>

196
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,570
finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to communication which is</font>

197
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,830
possibly one of the most neglected areas

198
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:21,719
of a data science and in passaic a few

199
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:23,609
the principles then of doing

200
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:26,110
communication well as spiritual

201
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">balancing what I've called caveats</font>

202
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">versus usability so talk about this a</font>

203
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,260
bit more later essentially what I mean

204
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:33,669
here is giving someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough</font>

205
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,779
information that they have relevant

206
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:38,299
context for their use case the decision

207
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:39,769
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make but not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> giving them so much</font>

208
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:41,508
information that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're completely</font>

209
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:45,680
overloaded and don't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

210
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:46,939
next next we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the</font>

211
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,620
perspective on the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

212
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:52,670
appropriate for the different

213
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,870
stakeholders<font color="#CCCCCC"> InfoSec data has a lot of</font>

214
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,670
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> stakeholders with different</font>

215
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,100
roles and responsibilities and you can't

216
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:02,209
show one plot to all of them to help

217
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:04,550
them do<font color="#CCCCCC"> their job then we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

218
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:08,628
insights to be actionable something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

219
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:10,099
touched on<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier when we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> present</font>

220
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:10,850
results from the data it needs to be

221
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,230
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that someone could do</font>

222
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,559
something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no point just</font>

223
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:17,059
highlighting a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bad stuff and</font>

224
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:20,029
and leaving them to it it's not really

225
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:22,639
useful and finally we need to be careful

226
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:24,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the probability of someone</font>

227
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,439
misinterpreting the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> presented the</font>

228
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,939
data is low so<font color="#CCCCCC"> our job is dazed</font>

229
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:30,319
scientists and this is what you should

230
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:31,939
expect from a data scientist you're

231
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:34,748
working with one is to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you</font>

232
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:36,559
understand what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they presented with you</font>

233
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:37,790
they shouldn't just be throwing stuff

234
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,990
over the fence and leading you to get on

235
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:45,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">with it so I just wanted to jump back to</font>

236
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:47,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">to machine learning again briefly to say</font>

237
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:50,389
where does that fit in so it's kind of

238
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:53,329
in this algorithms this algorithm

239

learning yourself for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example if you</font>

243
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,809
enjoyed the first talk this morning

244
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,769
you'd like to have a go<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

245
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:06,230
those algorithms and you're actually

246
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:08,720
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use what you find to make</font>

247
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,579
decisions make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do all this</font>

248
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,589
first bit or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data exploration and</font>

249
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:14,989
preparation you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to do all that as</font>

250
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:17,480
well and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

251
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,129
communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the results and secondly if</font>

252
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,480
you're looking at tools you know back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

253
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:24,980
the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of crazy vendor claims again</font>

254
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,480
look at what data they tell you they

255
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,120
need to have for their selection to

256
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,649
perform as they've claimed do they need

257
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,629
to collect data<font color="#E5E5E5"> for six months nine</font>

258
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:34,970
months which<font color="#E5E5E5"> data sets do you need how</font>

00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:36,350
cleaned<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a date after be because your</font>

260

<font color="#E5E5E5">the data it's built on so today I'm</font>

00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:46,390
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on</font>

263
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:50,589
the bottom and the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this tower of</font>

264
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:52,149
data science simply because there'll be

00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:54,430
a lot of focus on another<font color="#E5E5E5"> alga</font>

266
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:55,810
algorithms and other talks I think often

267
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">we forget that how crucial the</font>

268
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:02,619
foundations are and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually doing</font>

269
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:05,920
something with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data afterwards so I</font>

270
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:09,279
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk through how we can apply</font>

271
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,449
these principles of<font color="#CCCCCC"> data science to to</font>

272
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:15,520
infosec i'm just going to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

273
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:18,940
example of ulnar ability analysis so I

274
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,529
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the the data bit</font>

275
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:24,670
if you like getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the strong</font>

276
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:27,730
foundations now if you're analyzing

277
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,560
vulnerability data simply using the

278
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,450
tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> provided by your by your</font>

279
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,219

00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:35,380
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> log</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our web interface or using</font>

00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">reading to worry so much about all this</font>

283
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,890
kind of data science stuff because

284
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:43,000
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just looking at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pre-created plots</font>

285
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,170
made by the people that built the

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,480
database right so this should all be

287
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,449
fine it's when you want to do something

288
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,190
beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you can do in that tool and</font>

289
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:53,770
obviously in the last year people<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up</font>

290
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:56,410
exporting stuff in Excel and trying to

291
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,459
do additional<font color="#CCCCCC"> reporting and the problem</font>

292
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,870
when you do that is you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

293
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:00,969
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of framework and a way of</font>

294
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">handling that data otherwise you get</font>

295
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:06,130
into all sorts of trouble so if you're

296
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:08,290
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your vendor tool then don't</font>

297
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,390
worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it if you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> export the</font>

298
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:16,000
data do sing with it yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's how</font>

299
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:17,980
we can go about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so starting with</font>

300
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,700
the strong foundations so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind</font>

301
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:25,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">of set the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scene with an example problem</font>

302
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:27,220
they've seen in the last year so we

303
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:29,589
talked earlier about have a lot of

304
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,820
stakeholders in in infosec and

305
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:32,589
invulnerability data there's a lot of

306
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,940
stakeholders to you know if the patching

307
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:35,890
teams of owner ability man Joe you've

308
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,410
got the sea so pretty to report up to

309
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:40,510
the board as well and all those people

310
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,910
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass an information about what's</font>

311
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,170
going on so suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> C so</font>

312
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,199
house report on the vulnerability

313
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,849
situation to the board and they've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

314
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,970
nice trend line here of number of

315
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:54,070
vulnerabilities over time you can see

316
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,839
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen right it's a big spike so</font>

317
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,410
we know the what but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know the</font>

318
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,940
why

319
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,009
just by showing this plight if they have

320
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:03,579
to go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> defend this in a board meeting</font>

321
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:05,920
and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> something about it from from</font>

322
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:09,638
<font color="#E5E5E5">this data ello we have no idea what's</font>

323
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:14,500
causing this spike so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key</font>

324
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:17,850
points is to to make sure we actually

325
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:21,399
measure something meaningful in

326
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:22,959
vulnerability data we often<font color="#E5E5E5"> start off</font>

327
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:26,019
seeing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of and abilities</font>

328
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,660
reported whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in internal</font>

329
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:30,370
reporting I've seen that or you log into

330
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,800
your vendor tool that's the big number

331
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,569
the first thing you see but there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

332
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,878
lot of a lot of complexity in this so I

333
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:39,189
kind of wanted to walk walk through what

334
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,959
goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so imagine now we're</font>

335
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:42,399
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help the CSO understand that</font>

336
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,378
trends they can they can explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

337
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've seen give our in a bit of</font>

338
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:49,180
confidence so they're you know they're

339
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:51,699
not panicking we're gonna have to know

340
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:55,540
what builds what builds up to make this

341
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:57,040
number now if those some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those some</font>

342
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you in this audience might be very</font>

343
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">familiar with vulnerability data so what</font>

344
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:03,219
I say next might be kind of obvious but

345
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,899
the point I'm trying to make is that

346
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,209
anyone that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with a given</font>

347
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:09,939
data set<font color="#E5E5E5"> day-in day-out won't know all</font>

348
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:11,619
these hidden complexities so if you're

349
00:14:09,939 --> 00:14:14,349
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate about your</font>

350
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,149
vulnerability data to your CC who might

351
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,130
who might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been hands-on with</font>

352
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:19,560
the data they won't know all these

353
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,310
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious to you</font>

354
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,839
similarly if one of your colleagues that

355
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,949
works in a different area of info SEC

356
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:26,050
but you've got you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys got to work</font>

357
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:30,969
together you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not know all the</font>

358
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:33,430
subtleties of their data so I want to

359
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">just break this down so we're all on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

360
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,550
same page<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the kind of complexities</font>

361
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,399
that can be hidden those sort trends and

362
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,170
a basic number the first thing I wanted

363
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,389
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about actually was was kind of</font>

364
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,410
naming conventions so when I started

365
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:46,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">working with vulnerability day two a</font>

366
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:49,480
year ago I was really surprised that two

367
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,850
things were called vulnerabilities so I

368
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,189
know like you know if you're writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

369
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:56,439
bit of code you don't want to call two

370
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:59,319
variables the same thing same in algebra

371
00:14:56,439 --> 00:15:02,319
same in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff</font>

372
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,770
so it turns out that as many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

373
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:09,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably already know a vulnerability is</font>

374
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:13,840
a you know flaw in software that has a

375
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:15,790
unique cvid or a unique vendor ID but

376
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:19,450
then if we're referring<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an instance</font>

377
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:23,199
of that vulnerability on an asset well

378
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:24,640
it's also a vulnerability so get used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

379
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,100
this it's fine but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually pretty</font>

380
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,890
confusing and it sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I'm being a</font>

381
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:34,870
paedon and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely I'm anyway but</font>

382
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:36,250
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a point to this um I was</font>

383
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,610
working with one vulnerability manager

384
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:41,770
and she would have to go to the sea so

385
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:45,940
and explain the vulnerability situation

386
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:48,220
and you have these conversations we'd

387
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,920
say right we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got we've got 32,000</font>

388
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">vohne abilities we've got last week than</font>

389
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,089
last time<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we've actually only</font>

390
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,829
got 100 vulnerabilities I mean it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

391
00:15:55,090 --> 00:16:02,430
sounds crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard concept</font>

392
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:05,800
to explain so for the sake of clarity

393
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:11,020
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of rename that and</font>

394
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:13,089
call it detection so vulnerabilities are

395
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,530
things of the unique ID detect a

396
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,720
detection is an instance of that

397
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:18,069
vulnerability on an asset<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this</font>

398
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,510
actually makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of reporting on it</font>

399
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discussing with lots of different</font>

400
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't work with the data a</font>

401
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,160
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier so as we're thinking about</font>

402
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,600
language as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as the whole maths and</font>

403
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,130
data handling thing when you're trying

404
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,050
to communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people that aren't in</font>

405
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:35,860
the weeds of the data every day so let's

406
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:37,120
start to break down this this number so

407
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,200
if you remember from the the principles

408
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,840
of data science and the first things<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

409
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to get was that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> domain knowledge so</font>

410
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,940
we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start looking basically</font>

411
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:47,800
what this number<font color="#E5E5E5"> means okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got</font>

412
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:51,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">thirty-two thousand attack shins let's</font>

413
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,959
break it down we've got saved<font color="#E5E5E5"> 25,000 and</font>

414
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,359
changed since the last time we scanned

415
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,920
that's the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> explains a big jump we've</font>

416
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,040
seen on our original plot that we showed

417
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:04,000
to see so we've got a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of new ones</font>

418
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:05,770
a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> reopened once we've accepted</font>

419
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,140
the risk on some shots gone away we've

420
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:11,089
closed a bunch

421
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:13,260
and this all adds up to make that number

422
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:15,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that's fine but we still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

423
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,339
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do anything with this so let's</font>

424
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">break it down another to another level</font>

425
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:24,750
of detail so it now starts to get a bit

00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:28,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">more a bit more complicated and in the</font>

427
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,640
interest of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> since this is the last</font>

428
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:33,180
talk of the day I'm just going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to focus</font>

429
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,500
on one branch as an example take a look

430
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:41,190
at the new detection 'he's that have

431
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:42,270
come in spit easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read and we'll</font>

432
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,290
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that have come in because</font>

433
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,240
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> newly published</font>

434
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,710
vulnerabilities so you've had you know

435
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,930
Patch Tuesday a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff has been</font>

436
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:52,350
released you run a scan<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's all</font>

437
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">now detected on your machines you have</font>

438
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,949
some actually seen that will come in

439
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,110
because they're from an old

440
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,540
vulnerability that's been newly detected

441
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,639
on your estate so maybe this is sent

442
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:05,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">from 2012 that suddenly pops up on a and</font>

443
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">a bunch of assets that's that's</font>

444
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,630
potentially interesting and as we talked

445
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,820
about before<font color="#E5E5E5"> a detection is a</font>

446
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:15,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">combination of a unique vulnerability</font>

447
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,790
and an asset so we've looked at the

448
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,110
causes related to the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unique</font>

449
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:21,420
vulnerabilities changing what about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

450
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,800
assets well suppose you're also rolling

451
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">out a program to scan more of your</font>

452
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,110
estate so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> now skip scan another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

453
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,950
subnet so there's more assets so now

454
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,540
you've got more detectors of

455
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,890
vulnerabilities but that's that's

456
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,389
actually a good thing right you're

457
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,740
scanning more assets<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're getting more</font>

458
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,620
coverage this is a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we don't</font>

459
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:41,040
we're not worried about that also maybe

460
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:42,929
you actually buy some new workstations

461
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,950
bring those online even<font color="#CCCCCC"> an area that was</font>

462
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,900
already been scanned you've got more

463
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,540
machines against again this is feeding

464
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:53,280
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> this this increase but it's it's</font>

465
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:55,350
not something to worry about so I think

466
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,970
what we're going to focus on is is the

467
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,370
first two then things related to the

468
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,870
vulnerabilities but before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go any</font>

469
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">further there's a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

470
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:06,300
we haven't done which were the from

471
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:08,129
there the principles<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data science so</font>

472
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:12,149
let's pause it here and check the

473
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:15,060
validity of our data so let's look at

474
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,240
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> metadata so we have the 32,000</font>

475
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,590
detection

476
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,640
and there's a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time stamps and</font>

477
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,840
vulnerability data which you should

478
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,110
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> go in and have a look at just</font>

479
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:26,929
before we continue so let's have a look

480
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:29,840
when the records in the database we've

481
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:31,490
exported data for more updated I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

482
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">picked 90 days as a an arbitrary</font>

483
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,640
threshold this is when the complexities

484
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,380
actually it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not clear what the cutoff</font>

485
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,170
is when is data valid that will depend

486
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:41,510
on what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the use case is how frequently</font>

487
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:44,450
you expect the data to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be updated but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

488
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:47,420
this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> 90-day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed reasonable so</font>

489
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,400
we'll have most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> detections update</font>

490
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,730
in the last 90 days so they find that's

491
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,170
recent relevant information keep that

492
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:57,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll have some that have been updated</font>

493
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:59,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a long time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and again I've broken out</font>

494
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,290
for you hear some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the some of the</font>

495
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,620
reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> why it's and the complexity</font>

496
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:04,730
behind this number so some will be

497
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:09,800
detection<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that simply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

498
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:11,390
retested others will be have old update

499
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,120
times because the asset<font color="#E5E5E5"> later on just</font>

500
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:16,160
hasn't scanned and then if we again

501
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,750
follow on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> left-hand branch those</font>

502
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,820
that haven't been retested why is that

503
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,200
now we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to real kind of</font>

504
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,850
practical reasons maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's been an</font>

505
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,630
authentication failure so some

506
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:26,149
vulnerabilities you<font color="#E5E5E5"> acquire</font>

507
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:29,930
authentication to test them so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

508
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,950
fails we can't update the record maybe

509
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,450
the test hasn't been able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

510
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:34,460
replicated you have to replicate the

511
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,380
exact conditions to retest<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

512
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,850
vulnerability so if you move a bit of

513
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:43,190
software maybe maybe they<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't do</font>

514
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:44,600
the test again so again<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the</font>

515
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,930
complexity of assessing whether the data

516
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,909
is valid and making<font color="#CCCCCC"> decisions about what</font>

517
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,260
you do with things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are on assets</font>

518
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,430
that haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> scanned me don't you want</font>

519
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,550
to be deleting information about

520
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:57,050
vulnerabilities this is a whole kind of

521
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:59,600
issue around this what what the right

522
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:01,610
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in this case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we were we were</font>

523
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,310
going to focus on the new detection so

524
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:08,149
we're in this side of the tree diagram

525
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:09,820
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to continue the next kind</font>

526
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:12,110
of

527
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,658
word of warning<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess is around that</font>

528
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:17,539
the data quirks i mentioned earlier so

529
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:18,710
when you're exporting the data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

530
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:21,370
see something called laughs gand<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight</font>

531
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:25,610
thick<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just stick that in my er</font>

532
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:28,250
my code<font color="#CCCCCC"> I use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that plot some parts and</font>

533
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:32,000
graphs<font color="#CCCCCC"> that'd be fine do you really know</font>

534
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:35,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">what Alaska and date means is it well</font>

535
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,269
documented possibly not is it the last

536
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:39,259
time that there was a vulnerability scan

537
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:41,509
or the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a compliance</font>

538
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:43,820
scan is it when the scan kicked off when

539
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:46,190
it finished is it when that scan was

540
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:48,189
last authenticated or not authenticated

541
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,059
or the most recent<font color="#CCCCCC"> of either</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

542
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,350
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> loves you work this out eventually</font>

543
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,908
but a lot of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will just take</font>

544
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:55,370
the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that seems sensible and</font>

545
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:58,610
go with it actually had a case where

546
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,959
some was exporting data and got got the

547
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">wrong meaning for a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamp as it</font>

548
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,590
wasn't updating any of their information

549
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:05,750
so i mean this can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really crucial</font>

550
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:11,629
when you start to do data analysis off

551
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:13,759
your own back so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to before we move</font>

552
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:15,168
on then those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of warnings</font>

553
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:17,200
around other thing is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to check</font>

554
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:20,389
it's just to remind you where we got to

555
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at new detection to explain that</font>

556
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:24,908
that spike in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the trend graph for the</font>

557
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:29,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">CSO and we're going to focus on the</font>

558
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:32,539
things from some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> older</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

559
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,209
vulnerabilities this looks interesting

560
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:37,820
this appears to explain that spike so

561
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:41,750
next thing we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move on to is how</font>

562
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:43,639
we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually communicate this so</font>

563
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,110
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the communication part</font>

564
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:46,519
of data science now we're not applying

565
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,258
any complex algorithms as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said we're</font>

566
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:51,610
just getting some initial value from

567
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:51,610
some some simple metrics

568
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:58,650
now I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> communication has been one</font>

569
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,560
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the biggest issues I've seen people</font>

570
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:03,360
face<font color="#E5E5E5"> I touching it before there's a lot</font>

571
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,610
of stakeholders they all have different

572
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,139
areas of expertise someone's dealing

573
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,879
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> von</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> date or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every day other people</font>

574
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,520
aren't and the same applies for the

575
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:17,010
different controls and it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

576
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:20,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard to get your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> message across so I</font>

577
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:22,680
wanted to kind of take a look at this

578
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,030
it's basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> we called the data flow</font>

579
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,290
in infosec so you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start off</font>

580
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,360
down the bottom with you you're sort of

581
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:29,340
tactical data this will be everything

582
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,139
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your logs your controls and in our</font>

583
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:34,350
in our vulnerability example this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

584
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:37,050
going to be our 32,000 detections 32,000

585
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:39,480
data points down this end then as you

586
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:40,590
move up it's a sort of operational data

587
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,690
so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vull</font>

588
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:44,129
manager-level now that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

589
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,450
condensed down the bar managers probably

590
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:49,710
gonna be looking at I know histograms of

591
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:50,880
age of detections they can see what

592
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,950
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be patched next how they're</font>

593
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,290
doing keeping in policy so we're going

594
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:57,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">down from 32,000 data points arrows</font>

595
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,139
getting smaller down to maybe say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

596
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,120
bins and histogram compressing the data

597
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:05,790
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we move along to strategic data</font>

598
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,790
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going up to the level of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sea</font>

599
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:12,200
so or even the board itself and this

600
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:14,520
needs to get even even more compressed

601
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,800
in fact went in for sexting we worked

602
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:20,310
with had at the bottom end they were

603
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,830
producing maybe a sort of 15 page report

604
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:25,440
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top end they had a quarter of a</font>

605
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:26,610
PowerPoint slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 to explain the whole</font>

606
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,440
vulnerability situation in the business

607
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:32,250
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

608
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,920
compress this as you go along and it's

609
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,820
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> matter see it's not just</font>

610
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:40,830
people trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be awkward making you</font>

611
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:43,010
make the data more summarized it simply

612
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:45,480
has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way because as we go</font>

613
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:48,180
along this this chain we go up the

614
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,010
levels of<font color="#E5E5E5"> management the responsibility</font>

615
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:54,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the remit of the person in each level</font>

616
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:57,090
gets much broader so on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tactical</font>

617
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,740
level those 32,000 detection maybe a

00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,240
patching team<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe someone working on</font>

619
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,370
patching team maybe for windows maybe

620
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,780
just for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> UK so great they can have</font>

621
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,399
all the raw data they need it for their

622
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,980
job

623
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,050
and that's all they're focused on when

624
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,610
we get up to the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll have you see</font>

625
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:14,250
so who needs to have an eye on<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

626
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:17,490
controls on their estate across all

627
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:19,110
global regions she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> never going to have</font>

628
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:21,330
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the raw data from all</font>

629
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:23,100
them and what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more it's not her job</font>

630
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:26,990
right someone needs to made a<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision</font>

631
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:30,929
before that so what data we show someone

632
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:35,490
is essentially based on what they need

633
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:37,550
to do with it and this is this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

634
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,270
tricky because it comes down to one

635
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:41,310
important balancing act which I

636
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,629
mentioned as when the principles at

637
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:47,010
beginning there's balance between

638
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:48,870
caveats and usability so you need to

639
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:52,560
provide someone with enough information

640
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:54,540
to do their job but not so much that

641
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:59,280
they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to look at it or</font>

642
00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:01,639
they can't interpret it properly<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i</font>

643
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:05,220
think this one of the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenges of</font>

644
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,350
trying to get to data-driven decision

645
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,940
making in infosec is this flow of

646
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:12,389
information as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it goes up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> giving</font>

647
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:14,670
people the appropriate level<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

648
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:18,660
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do their job and</font>

649
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:23,580
recognizing that not everyone has needs

650
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:28,140
to have all the details at every time so

651
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:29,610
based on that what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can see is that we</font>

652
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,070
need different perspectives on the data

653
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:34,620
for different stakeholders and what data

654
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,689
scientist should be doing is taking some

655
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,489
data analyzing it and then packaging up

656
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:40,620
the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that they're really</font>

657
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:43,020
usable for the person's use case they're

658
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,800
trying to they're trying to solve but

659
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,680
when you do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you make something</font>

660
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:50,090
really great for<font color="#E5E5E5"> one person is not so</font>

661
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:52,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">great for the other person that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

662
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:55,770
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say is that kind of word of</font>

663
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:59,220
caution if you see some analysis in the

664
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:00,240
press or I'd know in being shown to

665
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,970
someone else on your team it's a

666
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,710
different level and you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's too</font>

667
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,780
simple where's<font color="#E5E5E5"> or is older you know</font>

668
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:09,570
really intricate details just think was

669
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,280
that analysis intended for you if it

670
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,750
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're probably not going to like</font>

672
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,320
probably annoying like I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> love to see</font>

00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,860
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> not been presented who doesn't they</font>

don't have time to look at it they need

677
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,969
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decision what's important is</font>

678
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">that people get the right impression of</font>

the data the impression you want them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

680
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:32,080
have say the outcome is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right one</font>

681
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:33,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">and often by giving people all the</font>

information you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give them you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">given them a bunch of logs and they like</font>

685
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:45,250
what the hell's this so effective data

686
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:47,500
science will be pretty targeted as what

687
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm trying to say so let's have a look</font>

688
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,240
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to run ability example let's</font>

689
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,940
have a quick look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> different views</font>

690
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,620
that different stakeholders will have

691
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,570
I'm gonna believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> owner ability data so</font>

692
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:04,750
we can you can see an example of what

693
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:06,789
I'm talking about so for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a see so as</font>

694
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mentioned before they have a broad</font>

695
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:11,140
view they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be looking across</font>

696
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:13,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">the globe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the pro-gun be comparing</font>

697
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,620
how different business units are doing

698
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,260
fact they are comparing because this is

699
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:20,080
what we've people we work with typically

700
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,760
look at so some important differences

701
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,370
we've gone away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from raw numbers now</font>

702
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,710
we're looking at vulnerabilities /

703
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:28,860
assets so kind of a ratio number of

704
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,760
detection the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our says</font>

705
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,280
otherwise when you're trying to compare

706
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,620
your different business units a business

707
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,350
unit with far more assets is obviously

708
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,389
gonna have far more detection of

709
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:42,879
vulnerabilities so if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

710
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:44,110
raw numbers the biggest business unit is

711
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,650
always going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to parity be doing the</font>

712
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:48,610
worst so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSO job here is to make</font>

713
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,730
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the business for units</font>

714
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:54,928
performing well so we look at a relative

715
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:57,340
number of own abilities and we compare

716
00:28:54,929 --> 00:29:02,409
across the regions and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

717
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:04,149
overall trend a vulnerability manager

718
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:05,860
for example he's a totally different

719
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,720
view suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

720
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:12,100
working in in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mirror in the Americas</font>

721
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,720
so this top bar here they need

722
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,889
completely different information they

723
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,480
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that that</font>

724
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">patching is being done on time nothing's</font>

725
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,510
being managed it's the kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

726
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:21,850
information they might look like might

727
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:23,230
they might prefer to look at be

728
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,570
something like this this histogram we

729
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,669
have

730
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:29,200
age<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the detection so how long it's</font>

731
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:31,539
been on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your estate across the x-axis</font>

732
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,289
and the number of detections<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that</font>

733
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:37,809
age on the y-axis this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing them</font>

734
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:39,879
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're if you're patching policy was</font>

735
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:43,510
30 days you can see you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch</font>

736
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:46,809
as I've renders way past that policy and

737
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:49,000
plenty coming up and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'd</font>

738
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:51,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably also need an actual list of</font>

739
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,620
detections to see what vulnerabilities

740
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,449
there to pass on to patching teams so

741
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:59,340
they can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and do something</font>

742
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:59,340
and this is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all the same data but</font>

743
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:04,480
there's no point showing this to the sea

744
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:08,980
so or the previous plot to the

745
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:12,309
vulnerability manager it's important

746
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:13,990
though that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily go from one to</font>

747
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:17,350
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in other the problems I've</font>

748
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:19,029
seen is that people will have<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level</font>

749
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">plots which when you break them down to</font>

750
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:21,490
the raw logs and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers don't add</font>

751
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:22,899
up we seem to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost some</font>

752
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:25,149
vulnerabilities someone's filtered them

753
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:27,489
out someone's done some weird thing in

754
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:29,168
Excel and you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't get from</font>

755
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,880
the raw logs up to the sunrise view and

756
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:32,919
back down again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's crucial</font>

757
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,360
everyone needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be seeing the same</font>

758
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:38,740
data it's just been repackaged but it

00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:41,020
needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the same it's the next point</font>

around how its interpreted so if you're

00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:55,149
at a scientist and your potting a chart

763

00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,770
something about your data set which

766
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:01,389
you're really familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can seem</font>

767
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:04,299
really obvious when you make a plot what

768
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:07,570
it's telling you but<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have to be</font>

769
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:08,740
careful that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to put ourselves in</font>

770
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,510
the shoes of the person viewing that

771
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:13,179
plot and understand how might they

772
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:14,620
misinterpret it and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're a</font>

773
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:17,770
data scientist basically a job to make

774
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:23,049
sure that the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a low</font>

775
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:24,730
probability of misinterpreting so an

776
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:28,210
example will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to show</font>

777
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:31,419
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show an average so when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 13</font>

778
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:32,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">work we'd like to see average time of</font>

779
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:36,340
the detection on the estate before

780
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:38,100
patching nice quick measure easy again

781
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,090
my dear compare the business unit

782
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,949
another one work with was like no

783
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,449
rubbish I don't want to see that that

784
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,100
heís outliers show me the full

785
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:49,210
distribution so it takes a bit longer to

786
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:50,740
to process the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that but</font>

787
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:54,760
there is more more information contained

788
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:57,100
in it so the question you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask</font>

789
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:00,180
yourself is if you're going to show

790
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:04,439
someone in the first case the average is

791
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:06,700
that guy away that it masks outliers

792
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,480
probably he<font color="#E5E5E5"> is but as you're going to</font>

793
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember it is going to be in the</font>

794
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,850
forefront of his mind when he has five

795
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,230
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> check the report you've</font>

796
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:13,330
produced and has to make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick</font>

797
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:15,910
decision on what to do on which business

798
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:17,889
unit needs to be contacted and told to

799
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:22,930
you know improve their improve their

800
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:24,220
process and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is again when the</font>

801
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:26,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">responsibility of dates lines to make</font>

802
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:31,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that the communication is clear and</font>

803
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:34,540
unambiguous and it shows us that the way

804
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:37,210
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> present data is specific not only to</font>

805
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:39,040
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> role of the person are they patching</font>

806
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:41,770
team<font color="#CCCCCC"> vole manager see so but also to the</font>

807
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,940
individual especially in roles where

808
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:45,100
people come from different backgrounds

809
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:47,080
so for example that the sea Cyril you

810
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,219
know some will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very technical others</font>

811
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,820
might be more from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a management</font>

812
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:52,690
background and they might have different

813
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">skill sets when it comes to</font>

814
00:32:52,690 --> 00:33:01,570
understanding data so we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bet all</font>

815
00:32:54,970 --> 00:33:04,210
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this in mind the next skill the next</font>

816
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:08,320
so the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> principle to apply is that</font>

817
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:09,520
of actual insight i mentioned so as a

818
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,070
data scientist when you produce a plot

819
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,780
or as a causal intersect professional

820
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,740
when you're producing your report or

821
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,230
when you're being shown something you

822
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:20,170
should ask so what what you actually do

823
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:21,370
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now I remember again this</font>

824
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,870
isn't about doing data science and

825
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:27,820
research is about working with intersect

826
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:31,989
team that actually need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do stuff so I</font>

827
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:33,429
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take you back now to the</font>

828
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:39,280
original part we looked at that trend

829
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:40,930
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSO is trying to understand and we</font>

830
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,060
saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would that seem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be to do</font>

831
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:45,060
with new vulnerabilities coming in old

832
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,169
vulnerabilities coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the state</font>

833
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:49,480
let's see what we can do with that let's

834
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:50,590
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at the away we can</font>

835
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,430
potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide some actionable</font>

836
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:54,399
insight

837
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:55,600
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> trend we looked at before is on</font>

838
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,110
the left you can see there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a</font>

839
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,760
sharp spike in in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last month the</font>

840
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:03,610
season<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a reason to go report to the</font>

841
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,020
board and from the kind of analysis we

842
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:06,129
did before breaking down all the

843
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:09,550
information getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that domain</font>

844
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:11,410
knowledge we saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that appear to be</font>

845
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:13,810
linked to the old vulnerabilities being

846
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:15,730
reintroduced on the estate on the right

847
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:17,710
if we look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> those plotted out</font>

848
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:19,960
separately notice we don't plot all

849
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:22,090
those things from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tree</font>

850
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,190
diagram that would just be that's you

851
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:28,060
know that's too many caveats right this

852
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:30,190
is usable we have in in yellow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

in blue the number of detections coming

from newly published vulnerabilities

857
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:39,699
there'll always be newly published

858
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,719
vulnerabilities because you can see this

859
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:43,089
is pretty flat this hasn't changed

864
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:54,640
that can that can happen is if you have

<font color="#CCCCCC">a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of out-of-date standard build so</font>

00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:03,820
passion again this is actionable this

882
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,509
these all these older vulnerabilities

883
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,470
coming in and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just poor process</font>

884
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,490
you don't to pass that on to your

885
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:38,740
patching teen that shouldn't be there in

887
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:43,720
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a pretty simple example but this</font>

888
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:47,200
is what makes something<font color="#E5E5E5"> usable the plot</font>

00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,040
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Left gives an idea but it's</font>

890
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,230
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the thing on the right</font>

891
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,940
which indicates what someone should do

892
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:55,080
next right go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and review process go</font>

00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:55,080
reviews<font color="#CCCCCC"> manorville yep</font>

894
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:10,160
yep

895
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:15,379
yes you have both actually yeah so the

896
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:17,210
the case of them the standard build<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

897
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:19,580
would be an old vulnerability that's new

898
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:21,440
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that asset but of course you could</font>

899
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:24,650
also have they could have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> detected</font>

900
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,510
on your estate before so when that when

901
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:27,470
that standard builders<font color="#E5E5E5"> up-to-date things</font>

902
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,730
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been detected on it they would</font>

903
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:31,580
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all been patched and now you're</font>

904
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,140
putting them back in essentially so yeah

905
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,670
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have both another another one of</font>

906
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:37,430
the complexities right so that would be

907
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:42,590
another avenue to go down to split<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

908
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:44,089
out further<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I feel like we've</font>

909
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:45,890
gone we've gone through the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

910
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:48,710
framework of data science for example of

911
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:50,420
vulnerability we've seen the way to

912
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:53,210
approach the data when you're when

913
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,830
you're handling it yourself how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

914
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,140
some insight and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a man</font>

915
00:36:54,830 --> 00:37:01,370
when you're trying to communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

916
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:05,180
what I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about in the last</font>

917
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:07,190
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of section is going beyond your</font>

918
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,750
data set so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this stuff we've talked</font>

919
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:10,850
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just for one data set and</font>

920
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:12,320
that's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> common in infosec right we</font>

921
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:14,779
have all these silo tools we look at

922
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,890
this one then we look at this one but

923
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually once you have this kind of</font>

924
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,950
framework in place to make sure your

925
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,810
hand handling data carefully handling it

926
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:22,370
properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people kind of get on board</font>

927
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:27,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone's agreeing on the picture</font>

928
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:31,310
they're seeing we can start to look

929
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:35,210
outside the data set when the first

930
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:37,700
things we should do next is start to

931
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:38,900
think about the completeness of that

932
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,000
data we just looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at we've done all</font>

933
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:45,410
that analysis but we haven't checked<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

934
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,660
complete the data is so this circle

935
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:50,140
represents all the hosts that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we found</font>

936
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:54,129
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vulnerability scanner database</font>

937
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,129
that's what we use for all that analysis

938
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:02,270
if we look at the all the hosts we have

939
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:05,000
an our state represented by this<font color="#CCCCCC"> grey</font>

940
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:07,970
circle<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we might find and probably</font>

941
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,370
will find is that there be<font color="#E5E5E5"> host on the</font>

942
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:12,290
estate that aren't being seen by the van

943
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:15,020
emergency scanner and unless is a good

944
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:17,300
reason they probably should be we also

945
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:21,290
might seen some posts

946
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:23,720
in a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> section here that are in the</font>

947
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:25,520
vulnerability scanner that actually been

948
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,750
decommissioned and we haven't cleaned up

949
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,120
those cleaned up the database<font color="#E5E5E5"> known as</font>

950
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:31,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">purge the data but the main thing we're</font>

951
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:34,880
worried about is this this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray</font>

952
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:37,550
area and the bigger this is the less

953
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,190
confidence we have in how relevant our

954
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:44,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">findings of what's driving fund</font>

955
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:47,120
abilities on the estate are so what can

956
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:51,680
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this well we can start to</font>

957
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:55,310
look in other<font color="#CCCCCC"> data sets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see to get</font>

958
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,950
visibility on these hosts now be great

959
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:01,940
if there is an a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> up-to-date</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cmdb</font>

960
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:06,230
but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my experience that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the case</font>

961
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:12,140
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can go to other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data sets and use</font>

962
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:15,500
those so what what we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> attempted in</font>

963
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:17,960
the last year is get data sets that will

964
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:21,640
go some way to helping us solve the

965
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:24,650
problem we have but it easy to access

966
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,089
often in security teams don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> own all</font>

967
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:30,350
their data sets there could be

968
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:32,630
outsourced owned by IT on some systems

969
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:34,370
logging might not be switched on to a

970
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,710
high enough level of detail to answer

971
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:38,960
the use case you want so you have to be

972
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:40,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">a bit pragmatic and get the data sets</font>

973
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,170
that will help you but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get</font>

974
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:44,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly again we want to want to get a</font>

975
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:45,080
quick return on investment so that

976
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">people can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do something with</font>

977
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:50,420
this data so when the things we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

978
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:53,180
using is is av data AV and vulnerable

979
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:55,610
typically quite easily available so what

980
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,710
you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> do then is we can essentially</font>

981
00:39:55,610 --> 00:40:00,050
join the data sets together and look for

982
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:02,690
hosts that are in both just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the overlap</font>

983
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:04,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in the case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of trying to get a feel</font>

984
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:06,680
for how good<font color="#E5E5E5"> our control coverage of the</font>

985
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:08,390
vulnerability scanner is look for<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosts</font>

986
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:12,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">are only in the AV data this is this</font>

987
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:14,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">section here and then we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can go and see</font>

988
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,070
why aren't they being wildly in the

989
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:17,720
vulnerability scanner we also can start

990
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:21,620
to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards some kind of percentage</font>

991
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:24,620
coverage of our vulnerability scanner as

992
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:26,810
a control so whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at data</font>

993
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:28,880
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> your controls you should try and</font>

994
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:30,529
understand the percentage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your estate</font>

995
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,900
that that control covers

996
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:34,940
if it's a really low percentage your

997
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,440
conclusions just basically useless you

998
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,830
try and improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> the coverage first then</font>

999
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:43,580
do the analysis afterwards so as with

1000
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:45,020
all the as is all the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of machine</font>

1001
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:46,490
learning hype some of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

1002
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,420
like sounds really easy when you when

1003
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:51,620
you first mention it actually really

1004
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:53,570
hard to match the data sets together so

1005
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:55,220
in the Valen dato typically work with

1006
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:57,140
you'll have an IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> but often you</font>

1007
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,480
won't have a hostname resolved often

1008
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:02,990
they'll be no dns name resolved send a

1009
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:06,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">navy data you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and match it</font>

1010
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:08,209
but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP address a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1011
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:10,610
businesses obviously all have dhcp so is

1012
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:11,600
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same asset now you can't check</font>

1013
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:14,060
the host names because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that most the</font>

1014
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,860
time you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if it's</font>

1015
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,299
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP address and they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scan the AV</font>

1016
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,400
scam was an hour after the Vong scan

1017
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:22,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay they probably the same well if it's</font>

1018
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:25,100
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours or four or five two days at</font>

1019
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:27,640
what point do do make that cut but you

1020
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:30,290
can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a pretty good first pass</font>

1021
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:32,270
with any post names NetBIOS names for

1022
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:34,190
example that you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> have in the data so</font>

1023
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:36,320
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not too there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> complex-- season</font>

1024
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:41,000
and that's probably that host resolution

1025
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:42,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">host resolutions probably other talk but</font>

1026
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,370
you can do you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a good first pass</font>

1027
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:46,190
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn something from this data</font>

1028
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:49,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then to learn more you can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1029
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:52,220
data so maybe can get the DHCP logs and

1030
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:56,810
start to see which assets are assigned

1031
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:58,370
which IP addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and at this point</font>

1032
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:00,410
you're really glad you applied<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1033
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:01,759
really solid framework of how to handle

1034
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:05,060
data on how to communicate it so you

1035
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:07,130
hadn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> done it this is an incredible</font>

1036
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:09,049
mess by this point and the more data you

1037
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:11,360
put in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard and harder gets to to</font>

1038
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:13,730
manage it sensibly so a lot building up

1039
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">that kind of that framework of data</font>

1040
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:17,510
science and apply not to intersect data

1041
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,910
allows you to add more data sources in

1042
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:22,850
and build complexity without completely

1043
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:27,370
losing losing all the accuracy and trust

1044
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:30,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">in your data the other thing I wanted to</font>

1045
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:31,940
to highlight so once you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

1046
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,800
all this data and you're managing it

1047
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:38,660
well you know what you're doing why not

1048
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:40,520
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things so we can start</font>

1049
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,470
to get a bit more context around what's

1050
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,550
going on with our assets right we can

1051
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,270
start to find when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were finding</font>

1052
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,680
hosting

1053
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,360
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different data sets we can start</font>

1054
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,649
to say how is that host looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,690
vulnerability data what<font color="#E5E5E5"> one bilities</font>

does it have what's the situation in<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">AV what else is going on maybe what</font>

users are logging on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> software's on</font>

1059
00:42:54,650 --> 00:43:01,880
that how we had any alerts from our from

1060
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,740
other systems involving that<font color="#E5E5E5"> host so we</font>

1061
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,450
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a lot more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> context</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that can</font>

tactical and operational work another

1064
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:13,940
benefit<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that if we start to bring in</font>

1065
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:17,210
business context information as well we

1066
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:19,700
can move towards having a wider view of

1067
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:21,500
security across the business we can

1068
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:24,710
start to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is more</font>

1069
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,880
relevant for the board they can buy they

1070
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,290
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get we can get a bit more buy-in</font>

1071
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,440
from the board right because when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1072
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:31,759
started to talk their language we're

1073
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,890
community we can communicate better with

1074
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,140
them they can give an overall<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture of</font>

1075
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:44,900
what the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of water sort of exposure</font>

1076
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:48,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">to risk is so the takeaway from this</font>

1077
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:49,640
talk is essentially that first of all

1078
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,840
data science is more than just machine

1079
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,250
learning there's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other stuff</font>

1080
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,740
it's a whole framework for how you can

1081
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:56,600
approach analysis and if we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply</font>

1082
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:59,060
this the way data handle is handling

1083
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:03,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">infosec we can improve the trust in and</font>

the communication of<font color="#CCCCCC"> security data the</font>

00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:08,180
benefits of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1086
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:10,010
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> and tactical operation away as</font>

1087
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,419
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get more context you can know</font>

1088
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:13,130
more about what's going on that might

1089
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:16,130
also be important<font color="#CCCCCC"> when working out how</font>

1090
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:18,590
to prioritize tasks to understand what

1091
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:19,940
which are the riskiest assets<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1092
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:22,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">possibly the most valuable thing in the</font>

1093
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:25,130
long run as we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to provide</font>

1094
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:27,380
evidence to management to the board<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1095
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:29,450
demonstrates how the work of a security

1096
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:32,870
team is lowering risk and helping the

1097
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:35,089
business at the moment the situation

1098
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:37,790
we're in is if nothing bad happens then

1099
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:41,450
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so no matter how much work you</font>

1100
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:44,029
do there's no evidence to<font color="#CCCCCC"> show what what</font>

1101
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:45,700
you what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing just nothing bad</font>

1102
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:49,370
has happens how to measure nothing right

1103
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:51,379
so this way can really communicate to

1104
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:53,210
the board what's going on what the

1105
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,950
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation is and finally</font>

1106
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:55,320
demonstrate all the hard work the

1107
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:59,689
inverse

1109
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:23,779
I have questions / comment and you

1110
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:26,710
touched on the importance of looking at

1111
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:30,140
basic statistics and I for me personally

1112
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:31,849
count is the fundamental staff that I

1113
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:35,000
look at first because that addresses

1114
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:37,760
coverage if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have good couch</font>

1115
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:42,820
your means don't mean anything you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

1116
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:45,290
establish statistical significance so

1117
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:48,560
yeah I think that's absolutely true and

1118
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:50,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of the problems I've seen is</font>

1119
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,940
people literally the numbers just don't

1120
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:54,050
add up so people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they have X</font>

1121
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,579
number of hosts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you look in the</font>

1122
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:57,619
vulnerability data like we've got Y

1123
00:45:55,579 --> 00:45:59,440
number of hosts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you meant to be</font>

1124
00:45:57,619 --> 00:46:01,970
scanning these are you not meant to be

1125
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,560
you have problems with simply numbers of

1126
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:05,509
vulnerabilities not not something to

1127
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,549
tell you expect to have because people

1128
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:10,160
are exporting data in Excel and cutting

1129
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:11,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and changing it see absolutely</font>

1130
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's that there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of value</font>

1131
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:16,130
counts<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first then try summing it</font>

1132
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:19,060
right let's look at a median you have a

1133
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:19,060
much better<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel of the data</font>

1134
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:32,530
yeah yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> City the exclusions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it it's</font>

1135
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,420
actually a big issue and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

1136
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:37,720
setting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people often do</font>

1137
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:38,830
unintentionally and so people you know I

1138
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:42,399
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not an expert in</font>

1139
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:44,710
a data set right someone present stuff

1140
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,600
to you they might assume it's obvious to

1141
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:47,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">you that they've cut out things that</font>

1142
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,839
haven't scanned in the last 30 days

1143
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:50,920
they've cut out severity one

1144
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,730
vulnerabilities because who cares about

1145
00:46:50,920 --> 00:47:00,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">those be portion capable of it and</font>

1146
00:46:54,730 --> 00:47:01,720
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not advice and they'll assume</font>

1147
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:03,490
perhaps that it's obvious those things

1148
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,919
have been done and as that goes up that

1149
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:07,509
chain at that flows through the level of

1150
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,550
management you know knows those cuts

1151
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:12,520
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been made right and then if that if</font>

1152
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:13,330
that person leaves the business next

1153
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,950
person comes in<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're trying to</font>

1154
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,240
replicate that reporting and the numbers

1155
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:18,279
just don't add up they don't know that

1156
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,709
that that guy chopped out those older

1157
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,140
detection<font color="#CCCCCC"> zor you know made that cut so</font>

1158
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:28,540
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that once you once</font>

1159
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:29,560
you get thing this approach working it

1160
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:33,509
needs to move saying that's that's

1161
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:35,680
repeatable then as well repeatable and

1162
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:37,240
automated if possible because then

1163
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:41,290
people can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop cutting bits and</font>

1164
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:42,850
pieces out you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have already touched</font>

1165
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:46,240
on a little bit but can you share a

1166
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:48,279
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of common ways that are coming</font>

1167
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,979
mistakes that you can make when kind of

1168
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,600
interpreting analyzing data potentially

1169
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:54,970
arriving at the wrong conclusions

1170
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:58,330
because let's say for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example certain</font>

1171
00:47:54,970 --> 00:48:00,700
data points are over<font color="#E5E5E5"> over represented</font>

1172
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:02,770
and therefore you kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh the</font>

1173
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:04,060
example you gave was of course North

1174
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:05,290
America<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the most amount</font>

1175
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:07,120
of vulnerabilities because they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1176
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:08,650
most amount of assets do you have a

1177
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:11,890
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other examples that are like</font>

1178
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:15,880
really easy to fall into like traps and

1179
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:17,970
stuff I think Kim<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a lot of it is just</font>

1180
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">around making assumptions actually</font>

1181
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:22,330
people will see in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the example I gave</font>

1182
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,589
round like the last scan date thing

1183
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:25,960
right people like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh that's obviously</font>

1184
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:27,640
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last time it was the scan started</font>

1185
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,890
and then they'll develop some really

1186
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,480
nice plot based on that and find out

1187
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:32,810
later that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually the last time</font>

1188
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:36,380
authentication failed<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1189
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:39,700
something so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about testing your</font>

1190
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:41,900
assumptions about the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually so</font>

1191
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> run a test</font>

1192
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:45,290
and see what happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you change</font>

1193
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:48,710
things to test your assumptions another

1194
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:51,140
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that we saw was in a</font>

1195
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:53,690
database<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would have no dhcp would</font>

1196
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:56,270
have an IP address used by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows</font>

1197
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:58,940
machine you get a netbios name then a

1198
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:00,680
linux machine would have that IP and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1199
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:02,300
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just assume</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i okay that they're</font>

1200
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably in another nullify the the</font>

1201
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:06,500
netbios field right that should be a

1202
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:07,700
blank now no it stays there that's how

1203
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,580
the date of it that's how the data

1204
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:12,770
stored and if you would left that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and</font>

1205
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:15,049
done all these plots based on netbios

1206
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:16,970
not numbers of unique NetBIOS names or

1207
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:18,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like that they could be</font>

1208
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:19,939
totally wrong just because you've

1209
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,759
assumed that if you built the database

1210
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:23,960
you would have done it like that it's

1211
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually the really simple stuff that</font>

1212
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,890
trips that trips people up before they

1213
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:30,560
even get to attempting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to apply black</font>

1214
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:33,259
box machine learning like this gentleman

1215
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,610
said you know the cats wrong or

1216
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:38,690
someone's filtered something out in a

1217
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:39,800
spreadsheet and not told you great

1218
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:42,830
presentation you're giving me flashbacks

1219
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:44,810
to it's a vm program so and a lot of

1220
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:46,700
problems we had but one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1221
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:47,870
had was with communication and I think

1222
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:50,480
you kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of touched on that so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> won't</font>

1223
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:52,339
forget any lessons learned in two

1224
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,560
different areas so I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been asked you</font>

1225
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:57,800
know when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was doing it for metrics</font>

1226
00:49:54,560 --> 00:50:01,040
that weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good to look at</font>

1227
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:02,900
like percentage of severity<font color="#E5E5E5"> Xin your</font>

1228
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,000
environment so you know if you clear all

1229
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:07,010
your level ones like you said your level

1230
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,600
fives would increase in severity when

1231
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:11,990
actually the security would be decreased

1232
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:14,960
overall so that's one example then it

1233
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:17,120
also went like impromptu<font color="#E5E5E5"> data so you</font>

1234
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:20,360
know taking your data times of the month

1235
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:22,069
may significantly decide how your data

1236
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,690
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> after patch tuesday or</font>

1237
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:25,070
whatever so yeah I wonder if you had any

1238
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:28,100
suggestions or lessons learned around

1239
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:31,190
around those two areas yeah i think the

1240
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:33,500
so to start the time analysis thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1241
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:36,440
think nothing you absolutely have to be

1242
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:38,540
careful with so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example when the</font>

1243
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,770
things we do when we first go in and

1244
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:41,690
start stop week when people's data is

1245
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:43,400
trying much to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their existing reporting</font>

1246
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:46,069
right but validation

1247
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:48,140
and you can find<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you export from</font>

1248
00:50:46,069 --> 00:50:49,420
a database on on a Monday one<font color="#CCCCCC"> way you</font>

1249
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:53,538
can export on a Tuesday another week

1250
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:56,000
data doesn't agree so it's important to

1251
00:50:53,539 --> 00:50:57,700
bear that in mind it's also important

1252
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,960
thing about whether you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font>

1253
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:01,879
behavior in kind of like a rolling

1254
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:05,710
window or if it's the current status

1255
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:08,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's important and that depends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1256
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:11,210
everything is quite dependent on what

1257
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:14,720
the use case<font color="#CCCCCC"> is so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1258
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:15,859
it's being aware of that and thinking

1259
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:21,009
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impact on your</font>

1260
00:51:15,859 --> 00:51:23,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">results um I'm you or your other kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1261
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:27,079
funny metrics being as for like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1262
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:28,660
you present your data on abilities for

1263
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:31,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">host which is an excellent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this metric</font>

1264
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:35,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't answered putting it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1265
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:40,640
a percentage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Agriculture yeah yeah my</font>

1266
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:43,490
gram yeah yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing</font>

1267
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's it this essentially comes comes</font>

1268
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:46,430
back to the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of breakdown right the</font>

1269
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:50,809
vulnerability stuff is you have to see

1270
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:52,819
what's feeding in I think you have to

1271
00:51:50,809 --> 00:51:54,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to guide guide people i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

1272
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:58,038
just doing data science is sometimes a

1273
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:59,328
bit of an education piece in the same

1274
00:51:58,039 --> 00:52:01,609
way that you know you can take guidance

1275
00:51:59,329 --> 00:52:03,170
off infosec professionals around the way

1276
00:52:01,609 --> 00:52:05,480
that data is useful to them and what

1277
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:06,770
they what they need to do their job they

1278
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:10,670
can hopefully take guidance from data

1279
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:14,630
scientists around the best way to

1280
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:18,079
present data and I think if you explain

1281
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:19,869
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people why why they might actually be</font>

1282
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:22,369
misleading themselves by showing that

1283
00:52:19,869 --> 00:52:25,779
and give them an alternative and show

1284
00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:29,690
them a valuable alternative<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's useful</font>

1285
00:52:25,779 --> 00:52:31,910
so maybe looking at like I said like a

1286
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:33,910
ratio of things instead of percentages I

1287
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:37,399
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> essentials can be fine it depends</font>

1288
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:39,140
it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're doing right the</font>

1289
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">coverage one can suffer as well right so</font>

1290
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,410
you know your coverage can be really

1291
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:44,240
good you can bring bring more assets

1292
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:46,308
online and then it takes a while for the

1293
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,390
scanner to to go and find<font color="#CCCCCC"> them so your</font>

1294
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:48,950
coverage plunges it's about having

1295
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:50,270
reasons might be on to explain that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1296
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:52,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference is</font>

1297
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:53,660
display sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I increase in thought</font>

1298
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:55,310
abilities may actually be an increase in

1299
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:58,700
your rest if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more clothes</font>

1300
00:52:55,310 --> 00:53:00,470
yeah exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that was the you know</font>

1301
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the tree the tree I had before that</font>

1302
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:05,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">was the point some of that some of the</font>

1303
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:07,520
changes are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually positive</font>

1304
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,960
you've rolled out your scanner to a new

1305
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:12,670
a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> business unit and I want those</font>

1306
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:14,750
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun abilities so it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1307
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:16,100
there's not one metric right that's

1308
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:19,000
going to give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole state of</font>

1309
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:20,720
vulnerability so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about having</font>

1310
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:25,670
potentially having a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of simple</font>

1311
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:27,470
metrics that are kind of that will flag

1312
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:29,210
up these areas they'll flag up things

1313
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,830
around process so looking at age of

1314
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:32,240
vulnerabilities and how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes</font>

1315
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:33,770
whether the old whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're new you</font>

1316
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">start to look at you know who says</font>

1317
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:39,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">standard build process or other things</font>

1318
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:42,440
also looking at tracking the number of

1319
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:44,840
assets so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing I've been</font>

1320
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:46,280
working on is actually as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> complement</font>

1321
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,500
to looking at number of owner abilities

1322
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,880
is looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> how the number assets on</font>

1323
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,590
the state is changing and you can

1324
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,600
correlate that right so if you have a

1325
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:56,450
set of metrics around assets you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

1326
00:53:53,600 --> 00:54:00,110
if that shot up you can expect a boost

1327
00:53:56,450 --> 00:54:05,240
in your in your own abilities and sits

1328
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:07,430
around grouping together metrics i think

1329
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,470
that inform each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other and for sure it's</font>

1330
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:11,390
challenging because especially one

1331
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:12,799
abilities are so many factors that<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font>

1332
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:15,319
into play but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think anything is better</font>

1333
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,420
than the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of current situation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font>

1334
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:22,810
seen where it's typically a number a

1335
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:22,810
trend and no insight at all yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font>

1336
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:28,770
hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks yeah great presentation and</font>

1337
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:30,570
haven't done this for a while I just

1338
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:33,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of questions but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think one</font>

1339
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:35,460
of the biggest ones i had was and ones

1340
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:38,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i grappled with a lot is the last</font>

1341
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:40,560
bullet you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have effectively here so how</font>

1342
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:42,180
do you measure how do you tell you know

1343
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:44,880
the business ownership the leaders of

1344
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:47,339
the money people you know what risk

1345
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,540
means to them is your definition of risk

1346
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">just lowering the number of</font>

1347
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:52,080
vulnerabilities is that it because the

1348
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,970
risk to them i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

1349
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has a dollar value associated to</font>

1350
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:58,049
it so do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have anything related to</font>

1351
00:54:55,290 --> 00:55:04,620
that that ties in the entire enchilada

1352
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:06,240
yeah nice phrase yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely it's</font>

1353
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:07,890
really complicated for sure it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1354
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,140
number of vulnerabilities totally agree

1355
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:12,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not that's not the point I think</font>

1356
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,890
this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of i'm</font>

1357
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:17,270
working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> my colleagues at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the murat</font>

1358
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:20,129
she is looking into into this in kind of

1359
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:22,830
how we can really estimate what risk is

1360
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:25,020
that might be looking at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1361
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:26,520
host centric risk seeing seeing how that

1362
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:29,460
plays out when you look at your controls

1363
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,960
across the infrastructure but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think as</font>

1364
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,430
a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of first pass when we're talking</font>

1365
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,940
about these basic metrics as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was shown</font>

1366
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:38,220
today it's simply about showing allowing

1367
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:41,510
the CSO to show that if he or she

1368
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:45,810
implements a strategy something happens

1369
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:47,730
so if they you know rollout

1370
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:48,840
vulnerability scanning on across more

1371
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:51,270
the estate they can demonstrate<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've</font>

1372
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:54,090
done that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more visibility so</font>

1373
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:55,620
it's around educating its around

1374
00:55:54,090 --> 00:56:00,360
educating the board on on what security

1375
00:55:55,620 --> 00:56:03,060
is doing as well I think so it's it's

1376
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:05,400
being able to show an outcome of work

1377
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:07,650
you do and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think when the examples of</font>

1378
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,600
vulnerability that can be problematic is

1379
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:10,920
if you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really simplistic view and</font>

1380
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,529
you just see an increasing trend you

1381
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:15,390
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that see so in my example had gone</font>

1382
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:18,480
to the board me like Dell God look at

1383
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:20,040
the spike in vulnerability 'he's people

1384
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,810
all kind of infer things that aren't

1385
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,100
true maybe like other bother what's the

1386
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:25,320
patching team doing this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rubbish</font>

1387
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:27,060
and actually you've you've actually

1388
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,990
improved coverage of the vulnerability

1389
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">scan will cross your state you're</font>

1390
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:31,319
actually saying good and it represents

1391
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:34,690
or something bad if you have overly

1392
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:36,530
simplistic metrics so simply

1393
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:38,540
repackaging the date in a way that gets

1394
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:41,000
inside the proper insight<font color="#CCCCCC"> it gives a</font>

1395
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:42,770
reason why things are changing and you

1396
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,200
can see so can go and point to and be

1397
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:46,670
like you know i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you i'm</font>

1398
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go see has gone up but that's</font>

1399
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">great because we've got we've got</font>

1400
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:50,510
awareness of these now we didn't know

1401
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:52,430
these were here before that's a totally

1402
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:55,700
different story to like oh this is

1403
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:57,379
there's a big spike I've got no idea so

1404
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,910
I think it's providing reasons providing

1405
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,800
evidence for<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you've done and then</font>

1406
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:02,480
eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> working up to two I mean that</font>

1407
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:07,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I say a million-dollar question</font>

1408
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:09,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">I this is getting a measurement of risk</font>

1409
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:09,879
to the business

1410
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,880
thanks
