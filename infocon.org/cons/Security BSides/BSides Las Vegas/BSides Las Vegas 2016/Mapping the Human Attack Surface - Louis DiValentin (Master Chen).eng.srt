labs scattered across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world my work</font>

is mostly focused on analytics and

00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:36,410
different mathematical models of

13
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:38,969
modeling risk or attack surfaces so

14
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,610
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> have always sought to</font>

in order to mitigate to mitigate or

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,600
reduce risk and so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past we've</font>

seen compliance as something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font>

has done as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bare minimum more recently</font>

22
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,858
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen that people have start to</font>

23
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,229
migrate to rolling access<font color="#CCCCCC"> certifications</font>

24
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,450
so its privileges that expire and then

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,580
have to be recertified patch management

26
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,250
in general is another risk mitigation

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,990
tool and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> more lately we've seen</font>

28
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,939
them start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use analytics to try and</font>

29
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,530
quantify risk within the organization as

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:20,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">well via internal detection software so</font>

31
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:24,030
analytics specifically based around

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,520
detecting attacks and user behavior

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">out when they are actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing risky</font>

35
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,829
behavior however there's been a part of

36
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,960
risk that they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't quantified</font>

37
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:40,199
yet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is the the human</font>

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">interaction risk so human interaction</font>

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,399

that they haven't built into their

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,780
mitigation policies and one of the keys

43
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,309
of this is that proximity like your

44
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,320
approximate a person is a measure of

45
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,659
your trustworthiness so people trust

46
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,758
people that they know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people are</font>

47
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,159
more likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to respond to spearfishing</font>

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,700
from people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,039
example use case that we always that we

50
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,459
like to use is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the executive assistant</font>

51
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:13,529
so the executive assistant<font color="#E5E5E5"> not does not</font>

52
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,010
necessarily have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

53
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,290
things

54
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,569
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> just based off their proximity</font>

55
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,030
to partners that have client

56
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:23,790
confidential information or things like

57
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,379
that they are still a huge risk factor

58
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,798
because if you compromise their account

59
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:30,060
your you have centrally giving yourself

60
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:32,970
location from where you can spear fish a

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're of</font>

riskier counted and someone who is

00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:44,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually privileged with the exact same</font>

64
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:46,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">privileges so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're how we've been</font>

65

trying to model how this risk actually

66
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">is and how how risk spreads from people</font>

67
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:54,000
to people and the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been</font>

68
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this is through graph analytics so</font>

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,139
if you model all your assets and users

70
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,940
as nodes then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a graph of</font>

71
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:05,250
users to end users to assets and the

72
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,340
interactions<font color="#E5E5E5"> between them and see how</font>

73
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,500
wrist spreads within your social network

74
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,180
and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> strength of these</font>

75
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,010
relationships can also be built into

76
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">this model so people who are closer to</font>

77
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:21,888
each other will have stronger will have

78
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,889
stronger risk transference properties so

79
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:26,549
you want we've we've been trying to

80
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,590
understand the network of access

81
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:30,810
available to each individual within the

82
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,910
organization so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to reach a</font>

83
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,099
particular asset<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a particular</font>

84
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,109

would<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to take in order to reach</font>

86
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:43,500
this asset<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you are</font>

87
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">a person that hey you're a common link</font>

88
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,370
that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through</font>

89
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:50,220
in order to do a spear phishing attack

90
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,989
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are you have a much</font>

91
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:55,290
higher risk inherent in your position

92
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:59,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually been this actually</font>

93
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:02,730
correlates very well to a very well very

94
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,048
well studied graph analytic mop graph

95
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,510
analytic metric called betweenness

96
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:11,220
centrality so between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the centrality is</font>

97
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:13,769
at its core who is who is the most who

98
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,909
it's a score of each individual user

99
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:19,798
based off of how important they are to

100
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:23,250
shortest path travels across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire</font>

101
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,630
network so how important is this person

102
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,900
to reaching other parts of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

103
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,729
and then once we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this calculation</font>

104
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,500
we can identify who are golden key

105
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:33,419
holders within our organization our and

106
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,490
how the risk from those golden key

107
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,969
holders spreads to people who may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

108
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,289
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the access but are</font>

109
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,449
people that if you compromise you could

110
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:46,560
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> access from one of these golden key</font>

111
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:48,360
holders and then once we do this we can

112
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually start to we can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

113
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">to prioritize protections and actually</font>

114
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:54,299
build them into our risk mitigation

115
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:56,100
policy like making these people have

116
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,560
dual factor authentication or other

117
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,300
security controls to make it so that's

118
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,479
harder for risk to travel from these

119
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:09,389
people so this sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a lot of</font>

120
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,880
manual data collection and building a

121
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:14,490
social network that there's that's it

122
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,710
sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of work however there</font>

123
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,020
is an approximate repository of all

124
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:23,070
these user to user interactions and that

125
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:25,380
is in the ad so most well well<font color="#E5E5E5"> organized</font>

126
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:28,380
organizations have ad information in

127
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,120
there that actually models who that has

128
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,710
hierarchical models of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire</font>

129
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,380
organization so who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> your manager</font>

130
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,090
versus who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is who is who are your</font>

131
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,669
subordinates and from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can</font>

132
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:41,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually build a network user network</font>

133
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:44,099
model that gives us an actual that

134
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,810
starts to build that Network and then in

135
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:48,180
addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> usually have</font>

136
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:51,960
departments and locations as well so if

137
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:55,020
I see you every day that is another<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

138
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,969
is another way of measuring how well I

139
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,880
know you so if you're in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

140
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,440
location we can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is another</font>

141
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,219
interaction that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to model and</font>

142
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">then the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing in the ad is it has</font>

143
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,510
all the privileged information as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

144
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:12,659
so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> harvest all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these ad logs</font>

145
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:14,849
than or all these ad entries then we can

146
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:17,270
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has access</font>

147
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:19,800
to these assets based off the member of

148
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:23,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the member of fields that are associated</font>

149
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this account so and then from those</font>

150
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,580
membro fields we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> even run some</font>

151
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,770
filters on them saying if there's an

152
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,389
admin in if there's admin accounts in

153
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,909
here we're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

154
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:35,130
make them<font color="#CCCCCC"> more important as well so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

155
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:39,979
harder to get to these accounts and then

156
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,979
specific PII is another example of that

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,699
so once once once we harvest all this

158
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,639
information we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually start to</font>

159
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:54,159
build a network and so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

160
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,919
before nodes will end up being<font color="#E5E5E5"> users and</font>

161
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:58,990
privileged verbs and then edges will end

162
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:02,080
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> being user to user interactions or</font>

163
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,789
user to<font color="#CCCCCC"> privilege interactions and then</font>

164
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,109
we can do some variable waiting based

165
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:06,669
off the important<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the privilege if</font>

166
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:11,530
it's an admin account we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

167
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:13,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">make that edge worth more once once we</font>

168
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,179
have this network we can calculate

169
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:18,069
between the centrality score so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

170
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,009
each node contributes to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> travel</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Theory eat the the betweenness</font>

174
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,639
centrality is essentially a calculation

175
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:35,740
of if I have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> node on the network</font>

176
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,699
what for every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single node on the</font>

177
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:42,610
network how how many times does every

00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:45,610
other every<font color="#CCCCCC"> other shortest path in the</font>

179
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:48,849
network run through this node so it's

180
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:51,009
it's it's essentially a measure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

181
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:56,380
important you are to moving throughout

182
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:57,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">the network and then the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

183
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,169
algorithm people out there the Big O

184
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:02,409
calculation of this is just the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

185
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:09,520
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> vertices cubed so it's a fairly</font>

186
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:11,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">lightweight algorithm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so to test</font>

187
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,000
whether analytics would actually capture

188
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,240
the behavior we would expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it</font>

189
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,880
though I went ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and built an actual</font>

190
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,789
network of influence for our technology

191
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,460
lab so I scraped the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad and pulled all</font>

192
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:28,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">this information and built actual user</font>

193
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:32,559
network that corresponded to our to our

194
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:34,598
to our network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then we we want to</font>

195
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,968
see if the behavior we expected would

196
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:40,149
actually emerge when we ran this<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

197
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:42,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Centrale group so the behavior we</font>

198
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:44,560
were expecting is that uses in proximity

199
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:46,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">to valuable privileges would receive</font>

200
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,260
receive higher between the centrality or

201
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,110
importance course and then so this is

202
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:55,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is the actual graph of our network</font>

203
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,370
blue nodes like these are users well as

204
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,510
orange nodes right here are privileges

205
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:04,750
and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the size the actual size of</font>

206
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:06,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">the the node it corresponds to how high</font>

207
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,610
they ranked in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the</font>

208
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:12,399
centrality score so these two users

209
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,500
right here are our network operations

210
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,690
manager and our security manager who is

211
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,630
also functions as our systems admin so

212
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:22,060
they have they have a lot of accesses to

213
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:25,870
these to these admin privileges right

214
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:28,359
here that no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> else has so as expected</font>

215
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,279
they're receiving extremely high between

216
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">the centrality scores that's that's</font>

217
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:36,339
that's behavior we would expect from

218
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:38,050
them and then these these edges are all

219
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:45,910
waited very heavily<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they are</font>

220
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:48,040
admin accounts but what we really want

221
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:50,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">to know is how does risk propagate from</font>

222
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,339
these from these two people so our

223
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:57,519
workshop coordinator is provisioned on

224
00:09:54,339 --> 00:10:00,160
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bare minimum of the of the</font>

225
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,769
privileges<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have however they</font>

226
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,480
work very closely with our network

227
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,880
operations manager in our systems admin

228
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,339
in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deliver workshops that we</font>

229
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,079
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> give to clients so they have to</font>

230
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:14,070
be in close contact with them and they

231
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:17,920
they work with them almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day so</font>

232
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:19,510
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see here though that they have</font>

233
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually received a higher a higher</font>

234
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,680
centrality score despite being

235
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:28,000
provisioned the exact same the exact

236
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:31,750
same privileges so they would be a

237
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,990
perfect person that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to Spearfish and</font>

238
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:38,140
to put put a<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-life attack vector a</font>

239
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,940
risk factor to this a spear phishing

240
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,399
attack from our workshop coordinator

241
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,350
asking them to approve an agenda or

242
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,589
something like that but that agenda has

243
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:49,959
macros enabled so they would actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

244
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:52,690
compromised it'd be much it'd be much

245
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:55,180
more likely to succeed from them as

246
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:59,100
opposed to someone else in our lab or

247
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:01,510
someone else outside the organization so

248
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,529
we can we can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of see that the</font>

identifying our<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk spread rip is</font>

providing value identifying high-risk

00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,660
spreads from our high impact users to

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,520
users adjacent<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them or in proximity</font>

255
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:28,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">to them and so for for the specifics of</font>

256
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:31,660
this algorithm I live I limited<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to 24</font>

257
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:33,610
4 nodes out so the the between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

258
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:40,290
centrality you only calculate it would

be it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very it would not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

260
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:47,680
enough to expect for the beyond someone

261
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:50,050
wouldn't be able to do for spear fishing

262
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,729
spear fishing pivots<font color="#CCCCCC"> in order to get</font>

263
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,680
from one thing to the other so we

264
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,690
actually we actually did limit the

265
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,579
actual shortest<font color="#E5E5E5"> the size of the shortest</font>

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> travel</font>

268
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,430
and that so so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward risk</font>

269
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:17,579
quantification analysis like this can

270
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:22,739
help inform<font color="#CCCCCC"> our decisions when we tailor</font>

271
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:25,620
risk mitigation techniques so if if we

272
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted if we wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

273
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,519
account for this risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we haven't</font>

274
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:31,500
captured yet we could we could do things

275
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:36,569
like focused training on specific people

276
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:39,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">who are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> close to these users however to</font>

277
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:42,719
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-impact users however are not</font>

278
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:46,410
are not specifically provisioned those

279
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:52,259
those accesses and then we can also

280
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:55,709
tailor security controls 22 Taylor

281
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:57,839
security controls to target these users

282
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:59,459
and make it so that it's it's harder to

283
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,290
access their accounts so for instance

284
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:05,128
<font color="#E5E5E5">dual factor authentication or something</font>

285
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:06,920
like that or<font color="#E5E5E5"> just even limit the amount</font>

286
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:10,920
of privileges that they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to</font>

287
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:13,319
so determining all this information is

288
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,979
great but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really just a starting</font>

289
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:19,610
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this this model doesn't take</font>

290
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:23,130
into account a lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

291
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:25,740
complications that you would that risk

292
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:29,069
comes from so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance we can also</font>

293
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:31,529
factor in hardening so as the

294
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:33,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">cybersecurity lab we are probably more</font>

295
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:35,130
less likely to respond to a spear

296
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,990
phishing attempt because we know what to

297
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">look for whereas in a marketing</font>

298
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,490
department maybe they don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as much</font>

299
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:43,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">what to look for so they would be more</font>

300
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,130
success acceptable to actually

301
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:48,209
entertaining a spear phishing or

302
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:51,509
responding to a spear phishing attempt

303
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:55,319
so we can we can factor that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to our</font>

304
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:58,079
risk models then we also have individual

305
00:13:55,319 --> 00:14:02,759
susceptibility to compromise so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

306
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:04,258
an nyu poly psychological study and one

307
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,790
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the key things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that came</font>

308
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:07,559
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that is that ten percent of</font>

309
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,540
people are going to click on the spear

310
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:10,829
phishing attempt no matter what so

311
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,309
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to they're just going</font>

312
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:18,050
to respond to it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that is that</font>

313
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:24,360
is that is bad like

314
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:26,459
that's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad yeah but if we know who</font>

315
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,060
those people are then we can also adjust

316
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:33,060
for them in our risk profile so for

317
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:36,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">instance we can do we can do testing</font>

318
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:38,369
spearfishing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know they're a bunch</font>

319
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:40,350
of companies out there that actually do

320
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:43,260
fake spear phishing attempts to see who

321
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:45,270
who in your organization are more likely

322
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,880
to respond and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can get that data</font>

323
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:50,220
we can incorporate it into the model as

324
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">well so we have a better representation</font>

325
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:57,510
of who is who are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the people</font>

326
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:59,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that can be compromised then we</font>

327
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,680
also have dual factor authentication a

328
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,890
lot of these accounts a lot of accounts

329
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">are not necessarily our dual factor</font>

330
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:10,890
authenticated however we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

331
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,450
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> model right now and if there's a</font>

332
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:15,060
dual factor authentication it makes it

333
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:17,490
much harder to traverse between from

334
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,859
person to person so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can maybe reduce</font>

335
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:24,630
how the wrist spreads on over certain

336
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:26,760
accounts and then finally there's a lot

337
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,590
of social media information that that

338
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,200
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't accounted for in our network</font>

339
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:34,320
I mean you might be friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> with someone</font>

340
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,660
and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in close close relation to</font>

341
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,520
them at close relationship to them at

342
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,000
all so we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually improve the</font>

343
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:44,310
underlying data by incorporating

344
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook connections or Twitter by</font>

345
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,209
scraping Facebook or Twitter to figure

346
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,640
out who do<font color="#E5E5E5"> people actually talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to in</font>

347
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:54,480
real life is this is this something

348
00:15:50,640 --> 00:16:00,270
those edges can be built into into our

349
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:04,020
actual into our into the into the base

350
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:08,910
data to better understand model how the

351
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:12,689
wrist spreads and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end goal is</font>

352
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:14,730
to have a quantified risk landscape for

353
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,340
for pretty much the entire for pretty

354
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,540
much the entire organization so like I

355
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,960
said before the betweenness centrality

356
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:24,240
actually scales<font color="#CCCCCC"> very well so this could</font>

357
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:27,240
be this algorithm could actually be

358
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,380
scaled out to do enterprise or larger

359
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,380
level types of

360
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:36,719
analyses and having<font color="#CCCCCC"> that information</font>

361
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,980
would help you would help when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

362
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:43,470
tailoring their risk mitigation

363
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:48,050
strategies<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and it looks like I sped</font>

364
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:58,830
through these slides so questions

365
00:16:48,050 --> 00:17:00,990
apologize<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that yep hello yet hell</font>

366
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,390
yes I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know if your crystal</font>

367
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:05,250
ball<font color="#CCCCCC"> is working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you'd be able to</font>

368
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:06,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">offer prediction about how far in the</font>

369
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,390
future do you think we're away from

370
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:12,390
actual security audits beginning to take

371
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,490
these kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of metrics into account and</font>

372
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:16,050
possibly saying hey you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

373
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,690
you have these employees it failed at

374
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,280
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> spearfishing they need to not be in</font>

375
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,470
certain positions please reassign

376
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,810
personnel accordingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah or you fail</font>

377
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,850
the audit or things like you how soon do

378
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:31,050
we see these<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of social engineering</font>

379
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:34,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">metrics actually made part of the audit</font>

380
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:37,020
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there there is there is</font>

381
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,179
some actual social area social

382
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,010
engineering being made part of the audit

383
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,170
process already<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font>

384
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:45,300
companies that already do the risk the

385
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:47,940
risk testing essentially to say okay

386
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:50,250
these are user in your organization

387
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,900
they're actually responding to to spear

388
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,640
phishing attempts and they just sends

389
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,800
its just an automated thing where they

390
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,070
send out send out spear fishing to every

391
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:04,260
single person<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the organization but</font>

392
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:06,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I i would say maybe five to ten</font>

393
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,430
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> before they can they can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

394
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,750
incorporate human interactions into that

395
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:15,450
into that into that risk profile it I do

396
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:18,090
believe it is coming but it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be</font>

397
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:20,460
as complicated as this so I know as of

398
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:22,290
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot of a lot of user behavior</font>

399
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,630
analytics is starting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

400
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:27,240
account peer groups which is another is

401
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:29,570
another way to to model user

402
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:33,240
interactions so peers that you work with

403
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:34,980
versus peers like peers you work with

404
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,190
you should have the same type of

405
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,860
activity if we see activity that deviate

406
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:43,050
deviates from those peer groups then

407
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,770
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we're going to flag that</font>

408
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:46,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">and say</font>

409
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,190
it's a risk

410
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,439
so I noticed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you had your node</font>

411
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,779
map up you had a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> examples of</font>

412
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,659
folks who you knew were important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

413
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:05,630
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of somebody who you expected</font>

414
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:07,549
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a higher risk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ality based on</font>

415
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:10,010
their position<font color="#E5E5E5"> going in yeah uh isn't</font>

416
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:13,549
the fat part of the big value from this

417
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:15,770
the unexpectedly high target did you

418
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:17,870
have any examples of somebody who you

419
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:19,429
wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect to have had as high of a</font>

420
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:21,850
risk centrality rating as it turns out

421
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:23,750
that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had and what sort of</font>

422
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:26,840
mitigations did you put in<font color="#CCCCCC"> place for</font>

423
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:29,600
that person afterwards<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we did</font>

424
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,449
actually we did actually find some

425
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,629
surprising things as there as well one

426
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:37,730
of one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our consultants had access to</font>

427
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:41,600
a lot of a lot of the admin accounts

428
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:43,970
because he was doing engineering and he

429
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,740
generated a much higher risk score than

430
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:49,070
than even our workshop coordinator

431
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:51,020
however he does need those accesses to

432
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,460
do his job so there wasn't really much

433
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,649
we could do in the risk mitigation

434
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,899
profile besides making sure that he's

435
00:19:54,649 --> 00:20:00,799
pretty hardened to phishing attacks and

436
00:19:56,899 --> 00:20:03,260
all of the rest of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and we we do do</font>

437
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,320
we we do actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do hardening and</font>

438
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,570
trainings for for risk profiles at it

439
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,580
eccentric was that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy there was</font>

440
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:12,830
like two big nodes in that big yellow

441
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:16,760
cloud than one yet uh if you'll take a

442
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:18,470
look yeah the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracing parallel no it was</font>

443
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,879
this guy right right that guy right that

444
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,370
was the one I was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask about</font>

445
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:25,970
actually yeah who was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> person that</font>

446
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:27,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">had that you that large of an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impact</font>

447
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,059
because when you first put up the

448
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,590
workshop cordon air going<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font>

449
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:33,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">out sighs know that the guy way over</font>

450
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:36,199
yeah yeah yeah now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the workshop</font>

451
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,750
coordinator is just is just very

452
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:42,140
interesting because they they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

453
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:45,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially Priven provision the barest</font>

454
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:47,390
level of access they have their more in

455
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,429
charge of making sure that the workshop

456
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:52,279
runs smoothly so they have to do the

457
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:55,130
they have to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a lot of the</font>

458
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:57,020
AV and making sure the agenda is right

459
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:59,990
and coordinating with the client in

460
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:02,059
order to in order to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

461
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:05,690
topics and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the entire</font>

462
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:06,149
meeting and then I do actually want to

463
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">call out</font>

464
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:11,100
the the visualization software that we

465
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:19,520
use graphs tree it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good and</font>

466
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:22,919
that's graphs tree graph history yeah

467
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there there this this isn't</font>

468
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:30,750
live<font color="#E5E5E5"> however it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interactive the</font>

469
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:32,810
actual on the actual network graph so

470
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:35,730
that gentleman actually took my question

471
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:37,530
so I'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask another one what</font>

472
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,690
tool did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use any tools outside of</font>

473
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,580
your own coding or your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to</font>

474
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:45,240
gather this kind of data and information

475
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:49,860
yeah so so the tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I used was I</font>

476
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:53,580
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerShell to scrape</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ad and from</font>

477
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:56,070
that I I converted it into I pulled<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

478
00:21:53,580 --> 00:22:00,629
into Python and I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> pi spark in our</font>

479
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:05,850
in order to do the graph analytics yap i

480
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:08,310
spark and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pi spark is distributed it's a</font>

481
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:11,520
distributed it's a lambda architecture

482
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:13,980
that you can do large-scale analytics on

483
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:18,240
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I probably didn't need it for this</font>

484
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:19,890
however if I had done the entire ad for

485
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,100
an organization I probably would have

486
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:25,050
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leverage leverage that and i</font>

487
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:28,889
did use graphics as well which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

488
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:32,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">package of pi spark next question I know</font>

489
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:36,150
you scraped ad for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I would be</font>

490
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:39,810
interested see how effective this opera

491
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:42,570
this process would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're taking</font>

492
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:44,190
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've linked in yeah you find</font>

493
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:46,740
here's a CEO and then here's all the

494
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:49,350
people at work at this company and see

495
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,570
if you're able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess the first</font>

496
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:53,600
article model right you may not get the

497
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:57,120
actual admin rights but you can make

498
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,620
educated guesses yes well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did want</font>

499
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,419
to do this from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the defender standpoint</font>

500
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,610
that is someone you something you might

501
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,010
do from an attacker standpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan scan</font>

502
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:07,439
a linkedin organizational chart and

503
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,210
figure out who who actually works in

504
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,240
close proximity to<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other when you</font>

505
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,500
target your when you target your spear

506
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,030
phishing attacks well then you could

507
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,120
also find out what groups are members of

508
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:19,899
what their interests are and

509
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,899
yep mm-hmm

510
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:33,530
um so you're currently using the ad to

511
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:35,540
show how connected people are um but

512
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">really most people spend their time like</font>

513
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,860
communicating with other people through

514
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:41,990
like email or some type of chat is there

515
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,969
a way we r you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could scrape an email</font>

516
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,920
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see like how much email</font>

517
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,390
traffic or use the metadata<font color="#E5E5E5"> of emails to</font>

518
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,170
figure out who's more connected to each

519
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:53,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">other possibly if I had access to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

520
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:57,850
data the thing that's nice about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad</font>

521
00:23:53,540 --> 00:24:00,050
is that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to have too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

522
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:02,600
provisions in order to actually go ahead

523
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:06,500
and scrape it and figure out who who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

524
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:08,540
who like the manager who your manager is

525
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,760
versus who your subordinates are all

526
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,470
that stuff is publicly available within

527
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">the actual organization you don't</font>

528
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:18,220
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> need too many privileges in</font>

529
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:22,310
order to get that<font color="#CCCCCC"> information I could I</font>

530
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:25,670
you might be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out smt SMP</font>

531
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:27,740
traffic just the quantity and build

532
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:30,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">weightings based off of that in order to</font>

533
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,230
go in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out who actually</font>

534
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:33,950
talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to each other verses who doesn't</font>

535
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:37,700
which it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be another way of</font>

536
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:39,710
incorporating so<font color="#E5E5E5"> in its it most of these</font>

537
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,930
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are about in improving the</font>

538
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:44,930
underlying data that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> building the</font>

539
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:48,380
network off of the network of influence

540
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:52,100
of access off of any<font color="#E5E5E5"> improvements to</font>

541
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:53,870
that are just going to reap gains in the

542
00:24:52,100 --> 00:25:00,199
analysis you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> only as good as your</font>

543
00:24:53,870 --> 00:25:02,270
underlying data I was just wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

544
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,920
any of the code you used to do this is

545
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:06,230
publicly available or if you plan to

546
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,180
release it in the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to clean</font>

547
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:11,180
it up a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there is um</font>

548
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:16,370
there is PII and client confidential

549
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:18,830
information in fact yeah yeah I this

550
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:24,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is essentially a map of a rat or ad</font>

551
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:28,909
so like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> anonymized it for this however</font>

552
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:31,010
I have I the values are actually still

553
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,470
there and I mostly just turned them off

554
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:37,220
from showing in the snapshots that I

555
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:39,049
that I had but I can't I I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> planning</font>

556
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,570
to eventually put this out there

557
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:43,360
you clean it up a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit first off</font>

558
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:51,889
cool we have time for one more question

559
00:25:43,360 --> 00:26:03,939
anyone one last question<font color="#CCCCCC"> no okay so less</font>

560
00:25:51,889 --> 00:26:10,309
time oh you have wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok all right ok</font>

561
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:13,269
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll steal that so that's it and</font>

562
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:13,269
let's thank Lewis
