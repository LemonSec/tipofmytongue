1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:14,059
excellent hello everybody good to be

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:16,340
here for the fifth time so for the last

3
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:18,320
five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did some presentations</font>

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:23,900
myself but now it's a monumental change

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:27,948
in in our style of delivery I and I have

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:32,830
brought two of my team members here to

7
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:36,170
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about what we find in the sock</font>

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:39,620
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> active threat analytics in in</font>

9
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:43,400
crackle so together with me we have

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:46,400
Oscar who is our security analyst in the

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">crackle sock and we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taka like a</font>

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:54,920
hero who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our security investigator in</font>

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,620
the Tokyo sock and we have one hour so

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,330
we prepared something here I think

15
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:02,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting for you we we come from the</font>

16
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:04,610
world of detection so we our main main

17
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,979
goal is to find threads as they<font color="#E5E5E5"> arrive</font>

18
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,289
on the network on the end point on the

19
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:11,420
infrastructure devices and more and more

20
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:14,170
it's a very hard task to accomplish and

21
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:17,420
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we are living in quite</font>

22
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,640
maybe it's not the right word but well

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,679
somebody has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a living and our</font>

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">customers are huge companies think I</font>

25
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:26,869
mean our smallest customer is a larger

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,960
than the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise in Poland we</font>

27
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:31,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have any customers here so so it's</font>

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,609
hard at this scale to detect<font color="#E5E5E5"> threats in</font>

29
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:39,770
a meaningful way and discover stuff and

30
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:41,658
and produce some value every day so so

31
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:44,030
so we'll show you what we are finding

32
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:46,520
and of course we will show you what we

33
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:49,520
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you and it will be several like</font>

34
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,459
10 10 cases some of them are very very

35
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,709
popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> some may be less from the</font>

36
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:57,979
deterministic analysis and from the

37
00:01:54,709 --> 00:02:01,490
statistic traffic baselining an anomaly

38
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:03,079
detection work world so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is</font>

39
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,600
the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this presentation and to</font>

40
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:09,590
remind you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did some presentations in</font>

41
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,140
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous year three years 2012 I did</font>

42
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:15,290
the ipv6 security everything is

43
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:18,980
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> on SlideShare we did about</font>

44
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:21,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network telemetry and we actually</font>

45
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,750
use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot flow analytics</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> modern or</font>

46
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:27,230
important nobody believes that you know

47
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:29,450
lock telemetry is enough in today's

48
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,548
world we move we move into behavior

49
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,349
analysis we move into statistical

50
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:36,560
analysis lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic is encrypted</font>

51
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:40,189
and we cannot do a proper decryption so

52
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,959
it's a very very important topic then I

53
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:44,000
was talking about networking security

54
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:48,319
treasures what is being developed two

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,060
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago right now and for the</font>

56
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,069
detection part is you know Cisco on

57
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,889
snort and we sponsor this project is

58
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:56,689
it's heavily heavily you know supported

59
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:59,950
by us right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have snort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

60
00:02:56,689 --> 00:03:02,659
that'll open up my<font color="#E5E5E5"> D many many many</font>

61
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,179
extensions to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original North engine</font>

62
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:08,269
are being developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's quite quite</font>

63
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:12,409
interesting topic and last year we did

64
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:14,659
an introduction to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to into the ATA so we</font>

65
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:16,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">announced that we are going to to build</font>

66
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:19,489
a security operations center in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Poland</font>

67
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:22,340
and for the last year we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

68
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:25,909
so so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what happened this</font>

69
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,159
is this is last year so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what how</font>

70
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:30,798
it looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> like one when I when I came on</font>

71
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:34,519
board I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the employee number one in</font>

72
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,919
Krakow and<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically my my first task</font>

73
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:40,609
was to build the facility so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> did it</font>

74
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:42,739
and this is how it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like today we</font>

75
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:45,560
are based in our enterprise park office

76
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,840
and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you like to visit me</font>

77
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:52,340
please please please please<font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let</font>

78
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,530
us know and and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where we work</font>

79
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,449
from from from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Poland the second hobbies</font>

80
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:00,019
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tokyo and taka is representing the</font>

81
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:03,139
Tokyo Stock and we have the our main hub

82
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:07,250
the mothership in RTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> North Carolina in</font>

83
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:09,229
this famous technology hub and a little

84
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:13,840
bit about technology well detection is

85
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:16,389
hard I think we are a kind of kind of I

86
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,738
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to say losing battle between</font>

87
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,720
people who do offensive stuff and the

88
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:24,020
defensive if you need to do proper

89
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,539
detection at the massive scale and do it

90
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,820
in a reasonable time frame and identify

91
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:31,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">the threat mitigated and do</font>

92
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,760
some I are functions there it's a hard

93
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,230
task to accomplish and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the</font>

94
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,630
resources you need to do a proper

95
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,180
detection to store the data to store the

96
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,550
flow telemetry to do in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Richmond to</font>

97
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,920
mangle the data to run analytics on top

98
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:50,600
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to final record the full</font>

99
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:53,810
packet capture right<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for highest</font>

100
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,670
level of<font color="#E5E5E5"> investigation to find things on</font>

101
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">the wire it's extremely expensive</font>

102
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,900
because we are moving into the petabyte

103
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,300
world and how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> run real-time</font>

104
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,219
queries how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you build such an engine</font>

105
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,500
so you have a data center to protect and

106
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,230
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a second one hood to</font>

107
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,730
defend and detect not everybody can

108
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,800
afford it this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem because</font>

109
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:16,010
you will not spend 50 million on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> DC</font>

110
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:20,150
and another 50 on on on the detection

111
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:21,950
tabs servers analytics and stuff to do

112
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:25,429
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help to have people</font>

113
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:29,000
right of course we we do more and more

114
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:34,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">automated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hunt we do more of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> machine</font>

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">learning either either either zero</font>

116
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:42,320
knowledge or some hypotheses based

117
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:43,880
machine learning we've acquired actually

118
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,200
a company called cognitive maybe you

119
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,330
know the guys are sitting in<font color="#CCCCCC"> czech</font>

120
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">republic in Prague there are those are</font>

121
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:53,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">50 50 people who have PhD in statistics</font>

122
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:57,250
and they do nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than you know</font>

123
00:05:53,150 --> 00:06:00,070
build new models to analyze let's say

124
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:03,350
distribution of DNS requests and

125
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:06,320
analyzing what kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of new malware use</font>

126
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:08,150
new kinds of queries so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

127
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,909
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are facing and it is not an</font>

128
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">easy problem this is how we do it we we</font>

129
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:16,610
build a huge technology stack it's a

130
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:18,860
full rack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> rec of gear and we ship it</font>

131
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,660
to our customer we connect the tabs we

132
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,360
acquire all kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> telemetry we</font>

133
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,520
generate our own telemetry we acquire

134
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,830
full packet capture and we run our tool

135
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,340
set on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we connect via permanent</font>

136
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:34,010
VPN to the gear and<font color="#CCCCCC"> dough and to all the</font>

137
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:40,310
tooling which is pretty a pretty hard

138
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:42,590
thing and it's not not let's say not not

139
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:47,480
cheap basically

140
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:49,700
it's quite quite a feat<font color="#CCCCCC"> to accomplish so</font>

141
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,980
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we do and now I will pass</font>

142
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,750
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> tours car to give you some insight</font>

143
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,670
into what we do on the detection<font color="#E5E5E5"> side</font>

144
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:59,690
model of a deterministic detection side

145
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:03,830
and taka will follow up with with with

146
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:06,440
the with the more anomaly detection side

so<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to talk about</font>

153
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:35,030
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> we detect if we now suck so</font>

154
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:38,030
some few recent cases that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> detect and</font>

155
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:41,270
escalate to our customers the first one

156
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:44,809
is an exploit kit I bet most of you know

157
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:52,840
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next place it is but to remind</font>

158
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:52,840
you it's a kind of it's a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

159
00:07:53,230 --> 00:08:02,930
injection injected code and the website

160
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:07,790
on which from from which the redirection

161
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:11,930
can connect or and then the exploit kit

162
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:14,950
can be done rounded which detect and try

163
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:18,970
to exploit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerability of our</font>

164
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:23,240
victims of the victims install software

165
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:25,250
or the web browser for example so doing

166
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,400
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can download some malicious</font>

167
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:33,140
malware like an ransomware it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

168
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:36,679
popular this time so how do you how do

169
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:39,740
we do it in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> stock basically we've</font>

170
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:44,890
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a TA service of the active threat</font>

analytics managed security service<font color="#E5E5E5"> a TA</font>

172
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:53,840
is a kid as we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this on the</font>

173
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:55,640
customer premise<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a kid that has a</font>

00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:01,510
lot of different

175
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:05,530
in security monitoring tools and gather

combines a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different meters to</font>

177
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:13,550
detect threats that occur in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

178
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:17,689
customer Network basically we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tab</font>

179
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:20,060
so the sensor installed on the customer

180
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,490
Network which gather all the telemetry

181
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:28,489
from the customer Network and send it to

182
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:33,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the to the decal so we can check it</font>

183
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:36,500
later if there will be such need so

184
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:41,390
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this case for neutrino</font>

185
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:45,260
exploit we received I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> soon's fire</font>

00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:53,090
as you can see from the external IP on

00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:55,870
our own customer internal tangled

189

something the host name was dealt

190
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:15,800
www.marketamerica.com there so the full

191
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:18,350
packet capture is the best to show us

192
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:24,380
what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on there and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can see</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and on this side www Marty</font>

194
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:31,730
something after right<font color="#E5E5E5"> after entering</font>

195
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:35,150
this site was opened another<font color="#E5E5E5"> site so</font>

196
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:38,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">Fannie something from the 85 dealt IP</font>

197
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:41,959
address that shows us that there was

198
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:46,190
more than only that smarty site next

199
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:50,150
site is a seijo seijo KCM site from the

200
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:53,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">ninety two dot IP address looking deeper</font>

201
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:57,319
we can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> file was actually</font>

202
00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:00,560
downloaded from the essay Hulk Hulk ACM

203
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,290
and it was a flash file so possibly it

204
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,920
was a malicious file at this point and

205
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:09,459
analyst investigated some part of the

206
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:13,240
case and escalated it to

207
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:16,779
today our investigators so he can check

208
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,629
whatever the file was malicious or it

209
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:22,779
was or it was not the investigation

210
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:25,720
should check it download they did look

211
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:28,360
at the hash of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file as we can see</font>

212
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:33,579
for the virus total it shows us that

213
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:36,069
it's some neutrino possible detonating

214
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:38,910
it in a safe environment for example in

215
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:42,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the thread grid it's our own Cisco</font>

216
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:45,719
sandbox the solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> for detecting the</font>

217
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:49,629
callbacks from the malware that is

218
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:53,589
detected he checks that there was some

219
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:56,170
call callbacks for that specific malware

220
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:59,889
and try to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> them on the customer</font>

221
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:04,479
Network he did not<font color="#CCCCCC"> find anything so</font>

222
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:07,110
possibly the the malware hasn't been

223
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,269
downloaded but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be</font>

224
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:14,980
notified about this so he created in the

225
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:18,160
customer portal an<font color="#E5E5E5"> alert about a ticket</font>

226
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:24,939
about this action as we can see we are

227
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:27,189
using a varies so a vocabulary for is a

228
00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:30,309
vocabulary for even recording an

229
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:34,240
incident sharing so it's a set of

230
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:38,559
metrics used for incident security

231
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,819
incidents analysis to to be in a common

232
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:44,079
more common language and more widespread

233
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:46,929
so as we can see the action was a

234
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:50,920
malware vector was web drive-by was a

235
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:53,889
downloader it was an external one and as

236
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,529
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that Marty dirtside was</font>

237
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:59,189
actually a restaurant side so the victim

238
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:02,679
probably was checking some restaurants

239
00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:05,799
the restaurant side was injected with

240
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:09,429
our a direction at him probably with an

241
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:14,069
iframe so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the redirection occurred the</font>

242
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:19,029
file was downloaded but the malware

243
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:21,520
probably something block it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and customer</font>

244
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:25,450
notified us that checks the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font>

245
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:28,980
remediate it because the customer are

246
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:31,779
doing that remediation part of the

247
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:35,529
incident by their own of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course we've</font>

248
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:38,740
got a different a different team

249
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:42,550
especially helping with the incident is

250
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:46,570
the security incidents really response

251
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:49,000
team sorry and as we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that the</font>

252
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:51,270
case was closed as resolved the

253
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,020
confidential data has not been impacted

254
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:58,960
so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is our latent load</font>

255
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:02,680

in the internet but hasn't been detected

261
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:26,350
and in 2015 it's began infecting

<font color="#E5E5E5">these victims mmm for this one we</font>

265
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:40,750
achieved a TA and always received us

many connected to the Trojan lighting

268
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:53,350
bolt I'm checking deeper we can see that

269
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:59,110
it's a variant<font color="#CCCCCC"> out boat connection so</font>

270
00:14:53,350 --> 00:15:01,930
possibly something was trying to connect

271
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:05,170
to the common server and as we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

272
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:08,800
looking at the ATA and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this looks on</font>

273
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:13,750
the full packet capture well we check

274
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:19,050
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there hello packets were sent and a</font>

275
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:21,339
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them really it was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very noisy</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">call-outs to to some external</font>

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:31,389
confirmed by the investigator

279
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:33,999
and customer was notified about this and

280
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:40,209
advised but watch what we should do

281
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:43,529
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mmm that picture is a alert</font>

282
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:49,138
from the customer portal about this case

283
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:52,029
the customer checks the infected machine

284
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:58,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">block</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the external destination eyepiece</font>

285
00:15:52,029 --> 00:16:01,089
and because of that it was resolved

286
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:05,378
<font color="#E5E5E5">another case is very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> popular SQL</font>

287
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:11,350
injection Oh asp says is the 11<font color="#CCCCCC"> its i</font>

288
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:15,249
think in the 2013 in top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 it's the</font>

289
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:20,410
first injections are the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

290
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:24,579
list so basically we received in this

00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:29,879

00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:33,758
us that possible SQL injection attempted

293
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:40,749
looking at the IPS and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> host name we</font>

294
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:43,569
can see that for the customer for the

295
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:49,179
customer site that occurred and there

296
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:53,490
are some more information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the URI</font>

297
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:56,920
that's happened mmm analyst<font color="#E5E5E5"> checked the</font>

298
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:59,610
full packet capture of course to see

299
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:03,519
what was really happening there and

300
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:07,179
revealed that for this particular case

301
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:13,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was a 200 ok HTTP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> status one means</font>

302
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:17,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it could possible be successful and</font>

303
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:20,289
some data<font color="#CCCCCC"> koontz leaked due to this he</font>

304
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:25,869
escalated this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an investigator</font>

305
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:29,230
to check it out more deeper deeply of

306
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:32,408
course customer has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> notified about</font>

307
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:34,960
this case or two because a possible

308
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:38,770
confidential information could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> stolen</font>

309
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,640
due to that SQL injection attack as we

310
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:45,379
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got also very sick</font>

311
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:49,580
shins here about hacking SQL web

312
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:53,180
application yeah what customer June has

313
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:55,970
done he<font color="#CCCCCC"> blogged</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the militias IP apply</font>

314
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:59,450
some restriction to the to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web</font>

315
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:04,150
server in that particular site which now

316
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:08,830
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not allowed to to try and inject</font>

317
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:12,020
any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of statements for for the SQL</font>

318
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:15,560
also he checked if the information was

319
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:19,670
stolen for that case it was it hasn't

320
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:23,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">been stolen and no further</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> size has been</font>

321
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:27,020
observed so any further attacks SQL

322
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:34,220
injection was not was not successful

323
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:36,230
possibly 404 HTTP status occur the next

324
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:42,170
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a brute force attack so very</font>

325
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:45,590
popular method to to try to enter a

valid credentials and source fire event

327
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:55,040
was for the SQL injection yeah are

328
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:59,110
received and checking it we can see that

329
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:02,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">there was the alert in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sauce fire</font>

330
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:06,080
then looking another<font color="#E5E5E5"> look into the full</font>

331
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:08,540
packet capture showing that that

332
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,720
particular SQL injection was not

333
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:15,110
successful because it was 40 for nothing

334
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:19,330
happened there but checking deeper in

335
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:22,219
the pickup of that particular house

336
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:26,320
analyst found that there was many

337
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:29,890
attempts and and it was a successful

338
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:34,659
attempts to get to the administrator

index PHP for the for the back end page

340
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:42,200
of that side looking what was going down

341
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:46,040
there we can see that someone was trying

342
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,770
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> brute-force the credentials so we can</font>

346
00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:02,629
which confirmed that such activities

347
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:06,730
brute force customer has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> notified</font>

348
00:20:02,629 --> 00:20:10,459
about this case and contacted us that

349
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:14,029
previous case was also in very similar

350
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:16,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this one but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it concerns a totally</font>

00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:43,009
see an attempt to enter it it was not

359
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:48,759
allowed because there was the

00:20:55,239 --> 00:21:07,549
we received actually our<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysts are</font>

focusing on searching and trying to find

and security incidents on various

365
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:17,200
premises so not only concerning on songs

fire events of deterministic and

signature based one but also doing our

our to put it simple scripted some

scripted search searches for particular

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe interesting cases and</font>

372
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,859
activities on the customer Network so

00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:58,519
for this for that particular case and

374
00:21:53,859 --> 00:22:01,879
email play was said<font color="#E5E5E5"> was conducted and</font>

month and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fishing that could occur as</font>

379

we can see one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them was found and it</font>

380
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:31,419
was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a campaign to fishing</font>

381
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:35,559
campaign to try to say to customer to

382
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:39,179
open the attachment and probably it will

383
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:42,309
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is very malicious and it will</font>

384
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:45,760
infect their machine of the customer so

385
00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:48,730
as we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the subject of this mail</font>

386
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,940
was a confirmation of the loan in an

387
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:54,370
attachment and in the content the bank

388
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:58,029
says that it's a confirmation letter

389
00:22:54,370 --> 00:23:01,959
that we that he should review it just

390
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:05,110
opening the attachment as we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the</font>

391
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,720
attachment has a randomized<font color="#E5E5E5"> and name so</font>

392
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:11,219
it's possible that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was not a human</font>

393
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:16,179
mate<font color="#E5E5E5"> because now there are algorithms</font>

394
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:21,580
that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> name the attachments to avoid</font>

395
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:25,809
detection but by for example some very

00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:28,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple antivirus protection analyst</font>

397

checks their first the hash of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font>

398
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:35,350
looking if we had been seen previously

399
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:38,860
and it had occurred that it has been

400
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:41,799
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> virustotal for example says that</font>

401
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:45,389
it's a some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of downloader possible</font>

402
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:49,649
blocking so a randomer in this case

403
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:52,899
analysts investigated at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

404
00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:56,010
to check it more deeply so the call-outs

405
00:23:52,899 --> 00:24:00,090
need to be revealed he escalated it to

406
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:04,270
investigator<font color="#E5E5E5"> and investigator detonated</font>

407
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:07,029
in a safe sandbox environment for

408
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:11,470
example a thread grid so our own sandbox

409
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:14,440
solution and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> collapse was were</font>

410
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:18,789
revealed so we see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some HTTP</font>

411
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:20,860
traffic was trying being made to some

00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:27,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">ninety month or something</font>

413
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:32,260

414
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:35,709
checks the the premises and the network

415
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:42,670
to pick up of the customer looking for

416
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:45,870
that specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyepiece if we if it will</font>

417
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:48,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">be there so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would mean that</font>

418
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:50,649
actually the infection occurred so the

419
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:56,129
malware was opened the attachment was

420
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:58,990
opened it contacted the c2 server and

421
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:01,900
possible the infection occurred but in

422
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:05,740
this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was no connection to</font>

423
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:09,669
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece and basically the case at</font>

424
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:12,940
this point was closed but the call-outs

425
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:16,179
that were made mmm has been recorded<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

439
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:25,389
stock and doing security monitoring and

440
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:31,380
analysis for many<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop-ins customer but</font>

441
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:34,390
also other other countries customers and

442
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:39,400
today i would like to

443
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:46,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">introduce some cases which is about</font>

444
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:52,950
looking for a memory because<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oscar cases</font>

445
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:55,980
are mainly signature-based detection and

446
00:26:52,950 --> 00:27:01,000
unload or also a deterministic

447
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:07,060
deterministic direction it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font>

448
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:11,850
very good to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> and reliable because we</font>

449
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:15,760
are already known distress distress but

450
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:20,110
yeah but the negative negative point of

451
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:24,870
has inch of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> reaction is that it can</font>

452
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:31,179
detect only non stress it is of course

453
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:35,709
so ETA is<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to also catch unknown</font>

454
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:43,050
stress how which is not covered with any

455
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:45,970

00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:56,770

<font color="#CCCCCC">good to know for customers in some cases</font>

462
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:15,460
and foreign cases are ones which were

463
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:18,670
actually not security breaches but they

464
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:23,830
would hopefully highlight some of our

465
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:27,850
approaches to detect unknown threats so

466
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:31,629
I would like to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

467
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:37,300
which is traffic based monitoring sorry

468
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:41,650
traffic very motoring with the same

picture we

470
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:50,220
or ingest we are taking a customer

traffic into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the our kid and there is a</font>

472

change which is called meta data

00:28:52,810 --> 00:29:05,679
extraction that angie is as named

474
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:08,860
extracting like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> URI all the HTTP or or</font>

little more<font color="#E5E5E5"> better utilized like</font>

is a advanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> analytics advanced</font>

regulating some parameters on this

490
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:20,230
extract it for all information and it

491
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:28,919
are at it and I Omarion a particular

492
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:33,280
sort of roll like that I don't guess

493
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:36,010
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> just seeing showing this</font>

494
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:40,660
information I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make any sense</font>

495
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:46,780
but I would I will explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meaning</font>

496
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:50,580
oh right a little bit but when we know

497
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:55,918
these are at oh there is our very high

498
00:30:50,580 --> 00:31:00,760
number of anomaly index so we

499
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:07,899
we would check this particular service

500
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:15,669
role and reeking<font color="#E5E5E5"> this um there was the</font>

501
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:20,949
look like look like it so at the end of

502
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:25,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">July to the are you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focused there is a</font>

503
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:29,289
apparent change change in trend there is

504
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:32,918
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great increase increasing in traffic</font>

505
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:38,529
traffic bites information and this is

506
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:43,029
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a traffic thrown at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deprivation</font>

507
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:52,480
sorry database server to a particular

508
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:55,450
server and a particular protocol so it

509
00:31:52,480 --> 00:32:00,210
is actual actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> database communication</font>

510
00:31:55,450 --> 00:32:05,860
with or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular server and it</font>

511
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:12,399
suddenly their increased very much it's

512
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:14,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting and we conducted on several</font>

513
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:18,039
investigations including reeking of

514
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:22,600
syslog messages ingested from customer

515
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:25,679
environment like that but honestly we

516
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:31,120
couldn't find any suspicious information

517
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:35,950
but we notified this event to customer

518
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:46,389
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> our customer can confirm if it</font>

519
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:50,100
is actually unexpected event or not and

520
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:54,699
the customer confound it was benign and

521
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:58,840
this traffic change was dude due to a

522
00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:02,049
special patient to transfer huge data

523
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:07,689
which was intentionally done by database

524
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:11,289
administrators but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a sub T</font>

525
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:20,169
customers octene how who we are facing

526
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:24,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">to they were not area upset so because</font>

527
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:28,509
of this notification the stock team

528
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:39,158
could know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the net network a</font>

529
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:43,779
little bit better um some details either

530
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:46,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll drag to explain so that customer</font>

533
00:33:52,049 --> 00:34:01,269
lot of kind of environments are so if it

534
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:07,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a office network maybe this kind of</font>

535
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:11,260
em although there is a traffic spike um

536
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:16,300
maybe it is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> our program but at that</font>

00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:19,089
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer the is the web customers</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty steep and as you so before the</font>

540
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:35,098
increase of end of dry there is the that

541
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:41,710
communication was a relatively low

542
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:45,579
keeping and add and one more thing is

543
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:49,899
dirty there are several servers which is

544
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:52,089
called as critical assets has been

545
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:58,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">defined which should be cautiously</font>

546
00:34:52,089 --> 00:35:03,730
moidered and I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking how we are</font>

547
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:07,050
praying is already here so it uterus is

548
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:13,050
a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple it statistical method um</font>

549
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:20,010
actually um maybe which can be found in

550
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:23,859
in very re pages of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> text books</font>

551
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:29,650
which calculates and update me and

distribution which is actually never but

560
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:09,540
sometimes it may be useful in this model

561
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:13,589
that reported animal index which was 149

562
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:16,900
indicates this indicates that the

563
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:22,690
probability of that event is Bureau

564
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:35,349
tense or power minus 16 it's almost

565
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:41,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">impossible yep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

566
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:41,160
about another case about DNS following

567
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:54,220
first I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell the result</font>

568
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:56,680
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually happened but this was</font>

569
00:36:54,220 --> 00:37:01,720
a customer's internal pen testing

570
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:05,339
because some customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are do internal</font>

571
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:10,290
pentacene without not not<font color="#E5E5E5"> write to us</font>

572
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:14,319
because one purpose is of course 2c0

573
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:19,420
security environment in perspective

574
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:25,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">walls of security but the answer the</font>

575
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:29,400
another one is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test us if we</font>

576
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:39,410
we can detect such activities

577
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:46,710
this case was this one yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> turning okay</font>

578
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:50,940
so hmm the frou-frou is a similar to the

579
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:54,300
formula so there there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a trap there</font>

580
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:58,050
is traffic ingested to our kid metal

detector actual energy is extracting

582
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:07,290
metadata full DNS queries to and

583
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:12,630
responses and advanced analytics

584
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:20,779
changing is looking for these DNS

585
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:26,100
queries and raised on a road like that

586
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:32,070
it is smaller and probably hard to see

587
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:38,700
but this is the query string and the

598
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:35,190
it should be reported to customer but

599
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:40,920
usually we see the traffic many<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> method which we need them most</font>

easy to you test due to the purpose but

00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:48,010
due to the purpose of the method to

640
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:51,160
bring data on DNS queries and the

produce much longer parameters than

643
00:42:53,590 --> 00:43:04,300
usual this is a some information from

644
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:08,890
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> tourist draw you can see this</font>

645
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:11,640
information from on this URL but here is

a distribution of<font color="#E5E5E5"> subdomain exams so</font>

like 50 or authority or 40<font color="#CCCCCC"> or 50 50</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this it is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is very different from</font>

651
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:47,470
usual case so based on that we taking

655
00:43:54,550 --> 00:44:04,650
several considerations because several

656
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:08,290
services generates a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> long name</font>

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> including our database</font>

658
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:19,380

these analytics and also internal names

in customer environment it this is also

<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes very wrong so when</font>

looking looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a no worries it is</font>

rugby's I mean maybe that that gorilla

676
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:40,810
changing oh we would report many of our

detection is heart exploitation is

686
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,400
easier this is the main message and the

00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:23,920
main topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there is a huge</font>

disproportion in in what we what you

have to do to to to exploit some

691
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:36,790
and and between what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to do to</font>

00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:39,400
detect and we are on the detection site

so so I hope it was useful for you I

00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:45,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">hope it you know was valuable of course</font>

695
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:48,970
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> never ending story we have new</font>

696
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:54,130
threats and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to adapt and and we</font>

697
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:57,549
we apply new innovative approaches to do

00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:59,710
it so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just to summarize in order</font>

699
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:01,750
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> blew this up because many many people</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">come to us and say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will build a</font>

00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:06,400
sock tomorrow no you will not because to

702
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:09,250
build a sock you need to have if it's a

703
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,900
real shock you need to have 24 by 7 if

704
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:13,840
not it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security department</font>

705
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:16,180
and you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go on the weekend to to</font>

706
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,950
home and<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy the weekend right but if</font>

707
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:20,319
it's a sock it's an Operations

708
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:23,439
environment you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it 24 by 7 so</font>

709
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:25,750
it at least 15 people 15 analysts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

710
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,840
then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have investigators you</font>

711
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:31,540
have to have people who know how to work

712
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:33,970
and how to build them and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tune</font>

713
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:36,880
them and how to build new custom tools

714
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:38,859
and how to maybe buy some commercial

715
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,100
product and introduce it into your

716
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:44,740
detection environment and modify and and

717
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:47,620
do some statistical analysis and this is

718
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:50,979
totally totally different kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

719
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:53,290
science its data science so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

720
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:55,300
everybody can afford aside a data

721
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:57,759
scientist it's actually quite a nice

722
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:00,120
story you know an engineer in Silicon

723
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:03,070
Valley earns I don't know one hundred

724
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:05,950
thousand dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus and the data</font>

725
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:11,590
scientists earn<font color="#CCCCCC"> three hundred thousand</font>

726
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:13,569
so how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them can you hire that's</font>

727
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:16,630
the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so this is the</font>

728
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:18,099
analytics part so if you have three it's

729
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:21,700
1 million per year

730
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:23,589
dollars then you have to have security

731
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,910
intelligence you have to have feet

732
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:27,430
threat intelligence security

733
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:29,828
intelligence is data threat intelligence

734
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:32,259
is contextualized data that is relevant

735
00:48:29,829 --> 00:48:35,259
for my<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment based on what</font>

736
00:48:32,259 --> 00:48:37,359
resources I have what workloads I have

737
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:39,789
what applications and what kind of

738
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:41,529
business I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am in this is this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

739
00:48:39,789 --> 00:48:43,210
sense of relevancy this is where the

740
00:48:41,529 --> 00:48:46,299
threat intelligence comes into play and

741
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:48,880
then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a technology and a</font>

742
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:52,210
lot of that and this is how we how we

743
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:56,079
how we do it and I hope those those

744
00:48:52,210 --> 00:49:00,249
those examples were quite interesting so

745
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:03,849
just just just just to summarize we are

746
00:49:00,249 --> 00:49:06,999
growing our glorious ad a sock and we

747
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:09,249
are hiring and we are hiring in all the

748
00:49:06,999 --> 00:49:13,828
all the categories you can you can

749
00:49:09,249 --> 00:49:17,348
imagine from the more entry-level jobs

750
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:19,420
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a kind of entry-level job</font>

751
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:21,279
intelligent analyst technical writer if

752
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:23,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are starting a cybersecurity career</font>

753
00:49:21,279 --> 00:49:26,289
and you know Cisco is producing quite a

754
00:49:23,529 --> 00:49:30,309
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of devices right there are millions</font>

755
00:49:26,289 --> 00:49:32,769
of cisco routers switches firewalls IPS

756
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:36,249
is IP phones and they have some

757
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:40,718
vulnerabilities because humans write the

758
00:49:36,249 --> 00:49:42,640
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it is prone to error right so</font>

759
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:44,650
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the vulnerabilities in our own</font>

760
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">products and in third-party products and</font>

761
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:48,249
of course we have millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of companies</font>

762
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:51,359
using those and we have to very

763
00:49:48,249 --> 00:49:54,160
precisely transparently ethically

764
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:56,950
produce information if we find the

765
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,200
vulnerability and this is we call it

you have long run<font color="#CCCCCC"> runner ability listen</font>

constantly to give exact information

773
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:23,170

the CVS the cdss approach and what you

00:50:32,069 --> 00:50:36,359
right so writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for as a beginning</font>

780
00:50:34,349 --> 00:50:38,309
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> subway security career I think</font>

781
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:40,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's great because after half a year of</font>

00:50:38,309 --> 00:50:42,959
writing this stuff and researching this

783

information in many sources you know

are the current vulnerabilities this

job job of threat anilyst where you are

791

using various detection tools and

792

of free software we use commercial tools

the story the decision is very simple

00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:42,180
you you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I recently met a mathematic</font>

there are a lot of genius people that

are just developing the code or hardware

818
00:52:11,729 --> 00:52:17,910
or both or some ideas and and of course

819
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:21,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">we try to use it as much as we can for</font>

normally you have spent several years in

00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:54,960
this in in<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the detection environment</font>

832
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:57,870
in the sock and you are able you have

right so so we have we have also

information and answer questions in the

865
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:31,020
real time because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course we detect</font>

00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:33,120
stuff but also the companies we work

867
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:35,910
with are asking us questions hi guys we

868
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:38,460
we saw that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> ours plank or we saw that</font>

869
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:40,140
in our very special detection system

870
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:42,630
that you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to cisco and</font>

871
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:44,759
can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe did you see</font>

872
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:45,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">something and we say okay we'll check it</font>

873
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,870
for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we will do a custom</font>

874
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:52,100
investigation based on what what what we

875
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:55,109
