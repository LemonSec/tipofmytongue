legal issues tangential to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity</font>

4
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:19,770
so first responders when they go to an

accident<font color="#E5E5E5"> scene recognizes concept called</font>

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:26,130
the golden hour and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means is</font>

events every one that touches that

9
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,600
victim can have some chance of changing

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,050
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire trajectory of whether that</font>

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:44,669
ultimate recovery is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look like</font>

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:46,920
now those of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us in cyber security we're</font>

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,469
not really dealing with matters of life

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,160
and death but we are dealing with

16
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:56,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">matters of significant financial impact</font>

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,858
IBM sponsored most recent ponymon study

18
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,620
that said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the average cost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of reach</font>

19
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:05,720
now is four million dollars per incident

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:10,679
that's up twenty-nine percent since 2013

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:12,450
and what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means is that each</font>

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,979

24
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:23,340
or stolen record why is that important

25
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:24,810
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sooner you discover breach and</font>

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,250
I recognize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of these breaches</font>

27
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,170
are not discovered while they're in

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,670
that you could be on a team that

30
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,799
uncovers a breach in progress just think

31
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred fifty eight dollars</font>

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,130
being able to handle an incident

34
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,360
expeditiously that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really matters and</font>

35
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:50,339
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that really matters about</font>

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,350
it is the fact that as we know as early

37
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">as twenty eleven the SANS Institute for</font>

least a playbook talking about the

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,540
incident response process or breaks down

40
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,020
into the response into six phases the

41
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,310
first stage of incident response is

42
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,439
actually what takes place before an

43
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,630
incident had happens it's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

44
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:14,390
preparation phase and so

45
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:16,640
you want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> prepared to be able to</font>

46
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">handle these incidents because if an</font>

47
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,809
incident happens and you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> prepared</font>

48
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:25,160
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lead to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no long-term</font>

49
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:27,890
financial impact now my talk today kind

50
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,000
of what gave me the idea about this a

51
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:34,910
couple of weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I was reading a blog</font>

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,010
by optiv<font color="#CCCCCC"> optum is the largest cyber</font>

55
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,790
worth of revenue last year anyway on

56
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:49,070
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> blog that the ophtho provided about</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Incident Response what they said was the</font>

58
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,410
number one mistake the companies make is

59
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:56,300
not understanding their legal regulatory

60
00:02:53,410 --> 00:03:00,579
financial and customer and employee

61
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:02,450
information and responsibilities so I

62
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,430
understand that the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

63
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,140
important I understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that running</font>

asim's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting in points</font>

65
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:12,350
ragging<font color="#CCCCCC"> dlp all that stuff matters right</font>

66
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,359
for what<font color="#E5E5E5"> also matters is that somebody</font>

67
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,579
has their eye on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ball when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it comes</font>

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,900
to regulations and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the legal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> industry</font>

69
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:24,020
and how it impacts you guys and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sadly a</font>

70
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:26,480
lot of companies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you work for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

71
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,950
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a corporate risk officer they</font>

72
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,720
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a compliance officer but the</font>

73
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,570
compliance officer is multi hat it

74
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,900
really doesn't get this risk yet the

75
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:38,329
board may have its eyes on one of all

76
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,640
maybe maybe not I talked to a lot of

77
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,680
companies in and around Tennessee and I

78
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,000
can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just now starting to filter</font>

79
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,650
down to where the board actually gets it

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,220
unless they've been subject to a breach

81
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:56,720
so that's why I'm trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

82
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:59,180
education to you today now the graph

83
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,640
here on the left this comes from 80 I

84
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,350
don't know how their mathematics works

85
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,929
at eighteen t but I have a feeling that

86
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:07,940
the top two bars top two bars<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

87
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,560
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally different what I'd</font>

88
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:13,790
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on the bottom three</font>

90
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:20,358
<font color="#CCCCCC">the attention of most companies sadly</font>

91

finds out about your breach just because

110
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,250

aware of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the struggle and activity</font>

and then alert the merchant the merchant

00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:43,909
mm-hmm that airline company reacted

145
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:46,309
probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the best way possible to</font>

called<font color="#E5E5E5"> case interview secrets a pretty</font>

152
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,949
interesting guy I subscribed to his blog

153
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:09,558
in his blog he went through what

154
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:11,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> United Airlines with their</font>

155
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:14,089
communication plan and what went wrong

156
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,389
and he said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there are three</font>

157
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:18,589
things that a company has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do</font>

158
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:21,319
effectively during a corporate crisis

159
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:23,689
first they have to emotionally connect

160
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,089
with their audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customers other</font>

161
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:29,569
Institute's stakeholders shareholders

162
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:32,449
whomever before anything else as a

163
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:34,699
matter of fact he said when the crisis

164
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:36,079
occurs people are emotionally outraged

165
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:40,300
because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a gross violation</font>

166
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:44,509
of trust and<font color="#E5E5E5"> or expectations therefore</font>

167
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:47,959
if if you are ineffective in that

168
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:50,539
initial communication it's all downhill

169
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:52,099
after that second he said you have to

170
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:53,509
accept full ownership of the problem

171
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:56,058
whether or not that problem was your

172
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:57,589
fault state it's your responsibility and

173
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fulfill it he</font>

174
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:01,429
emphasized that later in the blog<font color="#CCCCCC"> post</font>

175
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,999
by saying as a leader oftentimes

176
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:08,409
mistakes may not fully be your fault but

177
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:10,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">they are fully your responsibility</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

178
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:12,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">anybody in here in charge of a</font>

179
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,490
cybersecurity program for their

180
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:21,129
organization originating<font color="#E5E5E5"> raising</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

181
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:21,129
you're responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> responsible</font>

182
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,269
yeah whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's your fault I know</font>

183
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:28,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sucks but that's you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

184
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:30,889
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a burden of leadership right and</font>

185
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:33,740
then lastly what you have to do as a

186
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:35,719
corporation in response to in crisis is

187
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,880
state what you're going to do to fix the

188
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,620
problem explain that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're what you're</font>

189
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,400
going to do to fix it and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

190
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:47,770
follow through

191
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:49,870
no I like the walking<font color="#E5E5E5"> dead I haven't</font>

192
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,939
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> season seven yet so don't spoil it</font>

193
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:55,540
for me I<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to binge binge it on</font>

194
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:57,760
Netflix but this mean and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was all</font>

195
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,740
series of means in the wake of what

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">United did in effectively</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with their</font>

197
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:06,100
crisis communication plan so although

198
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:10,360
I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> more about legal issues I</font>

199
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:12,310
don't want to de-emphasize how having

200
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,590
your corporate communication staff lined

201
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:16,780
up with a message<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be generic you</font>

202
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:19,330
know fill in the blanks we recognize

00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:22,089

204
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:24,070
we're taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> X measures to take have</font>

205
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:26,950
something in the can you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't be</font>

206
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:29,020
making it up the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a breach or the</font>

207
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,300
day after and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a walk back a</font>

208
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,730
statement and then reissue a statement

209
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,099
because like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Victor chain said number</font>

210
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,300
one connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> with trust the first</font>

211
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,790
statement out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your mouth you better</font>

212
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,939
be reinforcing the trust your customers

213
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:44,439
having you reputational<font color="#E5E5E5"> injuries so this</font>

214
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,840
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of leads into the next thing right</font>

215
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,930
so one of the major for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> major</font>

216
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,430
aspects of a data breach there have been

217
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">studies now that have looked at the few</font>

218
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,300
publicly traded entities that have been

219
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,880
breached the effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> on their share price</font>

220
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay maybe they take an initial nose</font>

221
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,990
diet but they recover as a matter of

222
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,540
fact home depot I did a talk on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

223
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:07,210
couple couple months back home<font color="#E5E5E5"> depot</font>

224
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,620

225
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:11,560
in the day after the breach was

226
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:14,110
announced to put all your chips porn

227
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,719
read their bet your entire life savings

228
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:20,830
on it twenty-five percent return within

229
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,760
a year they're stocking up up up same

230
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,620
thing happened with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

231
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,590
publicly traded companies so it isn't

232
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:29,830
isn't necessarily the market impact that

233
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:32,050
you initially see that tells the full

234
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:35,910
story it's the reputational impact and

235
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:40,060
this is really hard to quantify what

236
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:42,610
what a uk-based company means i'll

237
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:44,199
probably mess up the name but<font color="#CCCCCC"> simipour</font>

they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that the overwhelming</font>

with the company that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had been breached</font>

241
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,630
especially if it had failed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect</font>

a small sample size right now maybe

247
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:04,419
that's just people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the UK maybe</font>

248
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:06,819
they're less forgiving than people in

experts all believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> average</font>

257
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:27,939

258
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,709
incident<font color="#E5E5E5"> is handled properly and part of</font>

part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that proper handling again</font>

260
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:33,209

275
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,329
work for an insurance company a large

276
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:15,968
one I won't mention the name they

277
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:18,899
weren't in the profit in this business

278
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:22,449
of issuing<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity insurance but</font>

279
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:28,079
definitely this is definitely an

280
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:28,079
emerging area of concern for each of you

281
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:33,789
so it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> intuit the dirty little</font>

282
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:38,169
secret about insurance companies is that

00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:40,730
they like to not pay claims i know

284
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:43,850
that's shocking to some of you

285
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,769
and they really<font color="#CCCCCC"> love the premiums</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

286
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,089
know back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the old days when I was</font>

287
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:48,949
growing up his kid the<font color="#E5E5E5"> insurance guy</font>

289
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:52,790
to face fantastic and then people's

290
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:56,089
houses burned down and you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> never seen</font>

291
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:57,680
a guy that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say all insurance</font>

292
00:12:56,089 --> 00:13:00,110
companies are<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom feeders like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

293
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,569
but it is recognized that insurance

294
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:06,350
companies have an obligation to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

295
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:08,120
own shareholders or mutual members that

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,670
they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay only claims that</font>

297
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,240
are legitimate and if a claim can

298
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:17,540
possibly be disputed believe me they're

299
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,579
going to dispute<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sony pictures</font>

307
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:42,680
wake of that breach he came<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font>

308
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:45,920
and said we're good fair insurance who

be great right whoa<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay maybe not</font>

313
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,970
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> during that breach the problem</font>

314
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:04,639
was that they had a number of tier<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1</font>

315
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:06,949
computing systems they were fully down

316
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,829
for several days<font color="#E5E5E5"> and each of those tier</font>

317
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:12,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">1 system they could not do business they</font>

318
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:15,170
were losing millions of dollars per day

319
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:20,649
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they had a cap on their liability at</font>

320
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:22,819
60 million dollars and then what happens

321
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:27,350
that reach insurance might not cover

322
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:29,180
losses as sony pictures of course of

323
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">course it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to cover</font>

324
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,079
everything if you're losing millions of

325
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,819
dollars per day<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's not even</font>

326
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:37,660
counting everybody and their brother

327
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:40,519
that Sue's you subsequent to the breach

328
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,769
as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know Sony Pictures was not</font>

329
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:45,260
made whole during that breach now this

330
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:47,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the 2011 article Sony ought to have</font>

331
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,310
known better this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a flashback so Sony</font>

332
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,410
had a previous breach they have a series

333
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,750
of breaches right there first<font color="#E5E5E5"> claim that</font>

334
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,000
they try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make against</font>

335
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,490
another insurance company<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zurich under</font>

their general liability policy was

337
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:05,650
denied shocker right Zurich said hey

338
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:08,650
this breach we're not responsible for

339
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:11,980
making you whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sony because this</font>

340
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:14,530
policy only covers bodily injury and

341
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,270
property damage caused by occurrences

342
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:18,850
other than the kind of cyber insurance

343
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:24,939
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cyber security attack that you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">experience good where did they get that</font>

345
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,650
idea from they got that idea from a much

346
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,700
cite a case on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Colorado called the</font>

00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:37,720
Colorado casualty insurance company case

348
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:40,240
basically during that case once<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

349
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,040
shocker<font color="#CCCCCC"> an insurance company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tonight a</font>

351
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:51,150

352
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:55,030
with them and said that your loss<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

353
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:56,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">eligible for reimbursement so general</font>

354
00:15:55,030 --> 00:16:00,630
liability insurance not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

355
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:03,160
enough which brings brings us to cyber

356
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:05,110
security insurance right so if my

357
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,969
general liability insurance will make me

358
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,990
hold and surely these new policies are

359
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,360
being peddled out in the marketplace

360
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:12,970
will they're specifically made to cover

363
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:22,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay there's a gold rush alone right now</font>

364

folks and there are about 50 insurance

365
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,680
companies as of 2014 that we're in the

366
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,660
marketplace I think it's all an article

367
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:33,449
this this year that said it's up to 68

368

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we can say is that it's going to</font>

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,010
so it's you might as well know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules</font>

431
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,600
what are the insurance company is going

432
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,120
to do this is what your corporate

433
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,740
counsel gather their hip the policies

434
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,750
but they may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be hip to cyber</font>

435
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:13,399
insurance policies maybe you can help

436
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,980
help them out and have a conversation

437
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:17,290
with them so let's go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

438
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the various ways</font>

439
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:23,170
these guys try to avoid liability one of

440
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:26,530
them is retrospective dating and

441
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:30,280
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that says is most other</font>

442
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:31,870
policies are subject to a date which

443
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,280
means a liability claims such as data

444
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,320
breaches arising from inverness

445
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,080
occurring before that date are not

446
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,360
covered<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they do to make it even</font>

447
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">more sneaky is their policies that</font>

448
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,860
contain language purporting to relate

449
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:47,260
all positive events back in time the

450
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,639
date of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the initial causative event so</font>

451
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,840
if there was an initial breach and then

452
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,030
the attackers went away and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they came</font>

453
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,770
back and use the same exploit and hit

454
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,420
your customers again they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

455
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,520
really like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all back to the</font>

456
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,980
original dates of the first breach so

457
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,500
your policy date may have gone forced

458
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:05,440
but it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not cover the event next</font>

459
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:08,290
exclusions so<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost all these policies</font>

460
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,730
written to copy what had already<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

461
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,260
done with other insurance policies

462
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,060
you've looked at any property and

463
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,710
casualty call so you'll see that there's

464
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:18,580
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hole there's a whole section there</font>

465
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:20,380
about acts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> God acts of war or acts of</font>

466
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,720
terrorism all that stuff's excluded from

467
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,120
coverage well guess what a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

468
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,790
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cyber security space that are</font>

469
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,830
being briefed a lot of breaches now as

470
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:32,710
we saw the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNC hacks and some others</font>

471
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:34,870
Sammy pictures sometimes being

472
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,790
attributed back to nation state actors

473
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:40,080
and therefore if your policy has an

474
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:42,670
exclusion for terrorism or act of war

475
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,830
you're not going to cover insurance

476
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:48,970
companies going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say oh thanks to the</font>

477
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:52,030
premiums deny other limitations on

478
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:54,070
coverage so<font color="#CCCCCC"> all other exclusions so</font>

479
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,330
third-party negligence sometimes that's

480
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:58,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">not covered so if you've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a cloud</font>

481
00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,939
provider<font color="#E5E5E5"> they screw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a</font>

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party you're not covered some of</font>

483
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">them have special language around</font>

484
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:07,300
encryption of data does it apply the

485
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,280
data in motion does apply to data at

486
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,860
rest who knows where is wealth about it

487
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,450
lawyers love to write they contractual

488
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:17,350
language so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can make it mean</font>

489
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:18,700
anything data not encrypted claims night

490
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:23,620
good luck<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting money out of the</font>

491
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:26,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">insurance company and next there</font>

492
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:29,320
formal and informal inquiries that can

493
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,750
come in from attorneys generals after a

494
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,790
data breach some of that stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font>

495
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:36,100
covered so all that effort that goes

496
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:38,200
into responding to these regulatory

497
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,080
agencies and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hey heard you had a</font>

498
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,430
breach so we want this from you and this

499
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,320
from you and this from you and this from

500
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,720
you and you go wow this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cost</font>

501
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,439
my guys like 3,000 points for a hundred

502
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">a let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me make an insurance money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no deny</font>

503
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,540
because your relatives regulatory

504
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:59,820
agencies or or your own negligence

505
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:03,070
sometimes are excluded<font color="#CCCCCC"> from coverage so</font>

506
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:06,010
just be aware of this PF changs<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i'll</font>

507
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,450
give you one<font color="#E5E5E5"> PF changs they had 1.7</font>

544
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:37,500
on this part of the presentation because

545
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:41,550
I love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give insurance companies all</font>

546
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:44,610
right I'm so sorry if I'm boring some

547
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:47,580
you to tears so folk insurance retention

548
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:50,280
what's that so if I am target

549
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,570
post-breach and I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out as they did and</font>

550
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,820
I managed to get a

551
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:56,280
hundred-million-dollar policy to cover

552
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,810
future cyber security incidents because

553
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,780
I'm a little hip to what happens now

554
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:02,460
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been breached badly the</font>

555
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:05,340
insurance company said that's great

556
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,560
target but 25 million dollars the first

557
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,659
25 million you pay kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like the</font>

558
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:12,570
deductible on your own auto insurance or

559
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:16,560
health insurance<font color="#E5E5E5"> they call it self</font>

560
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:19,320
insurance for attention I call it what

561
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:22,290
good as insurance more premium increases

562
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:26,189
so because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the complexity in the</font>

563
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:29,040
marketplace and because over the last oh

564
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:31,680
I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> say five years there's been a real</font>

565
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,540
evolution the threat right so even

566
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,800
though insurance companies and actually

567
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,540
thought they had a handle it with the

568
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,000
risk is the risk is constantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolving</font>

569
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:41,190
so they don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand and</font>

570
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,710
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of Regents you saw</font>

571
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:46,050
the ransomware pop up the number of

572
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:48,210
breaches<font color="#CCCCCC"> pop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up the number claims being</font>

573
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:50,310
made up up up so guess what happens to

574
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:51,840
premiums actuaries<font color="#CCCCCC"> realize hey we</font>

court system because I all these claims

579
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,600
but some of them are still getting

580
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:02,760
through and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not able to handle</font>

00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,120
they realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that right so they're</font>

586
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,520
jacking up the premiums so even if your

<font color="#CCCCCC">is purchasing just because they look at</font>

what the potential increase in premiums

00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:29,370
could be so be aware that's going to

593
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:32,040
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> the inability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get coverage so</font>

594
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:35,370
funny story<font color="#E5E5E5"> not funny ha-ha but funny</font>

595
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:40,409
this is kind of odd Lloyd's of London

596
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:43,510
said hey look at all these risks for the

597
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:46,810
for the electrical industry over here in

598
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:48,910
Europe tremendous amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of risk you</font>

599
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:50,590
guys really out of my insurance and so

600
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:52,120
what happens all these electrical

601
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,730
companies in Europe try to get insurance

602
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,649
and what happens they can't get

603
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:59,160
insurance nobody will write them<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

604
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:01,390
policy because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the risk is too high so</font>

605
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:04,990
the people that need it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like</font>

606
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:07,240
health which was allegedly addressed

607
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:10,470
with the Americans the Affordable Care

608

Act which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't go there but</font>

609
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,650
sometimes the people that are most in

610
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:18,040
need of insurance are the ones that are

611
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:20,260
completely uninsurable and that could be

612
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're coming unfortunately if you're in</font>

613
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:25,300
certain industries and then finally a

614
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,880
other other people get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of paying</font>

615
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:30,430
claims so misrepresentations on your

00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">application the scary part of this the</font>

617
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:35,470
really scary part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is that it</font>

618
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:38,980
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily need to be a</font>

619
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:40,720
material misrepresentation about the

620
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,760
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> breached or so I'll</font>

621
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,220
give you an example so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you</font>

622
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,560
made a material misrepresentation on

623
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,840
your policy application about the state

624
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:52,090
of your antivirus that the breach<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

625
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,399
happened was due to a lost laptop that

626
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:56,740
had no full disk encryption nothing to

627
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:00,070
do nothing to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all with the fact</font>

628
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,690
that you had no AV sadly<font color="#E5E5E5"> that material</font>

629
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:04,210
misrepresentation is the basis for

630
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">denying the entire claim doesn't matter</font>

631
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:08,220
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the misrepresentation had nothing</font>

632
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:10,510
to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the breach actually</font>

633
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,670
having to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach actually occurred so</font>

634
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:14,860
pretty sad there and then finally

635
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:16,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">promissory warrants reads what what</font>

636
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:19,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">insurance companies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is say hey</font>

637
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:20,620
great thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the application and oh</font>

638
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,930
by the way you have a continuing

639
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:27,120
obligation to maintain your security in

640
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:31,890
the state<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you told us you had</font>

641
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:34,449
otherwise I let us know<font color="#E5E5E5"> right because</font>

642
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:37,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">your coverage we may need to a cut</font>

643
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:39,430
adjust it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you drift from</font>

644
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,870
what you had on your policy application

645
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:45,060
due to let's say a merger<font color="#E5E5E5"> or acquisition</font>

646
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:47,830
or major teams change the technology etc

647
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:52,149
and then you have a breach and then you

648
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:56,699
to be reimbursed<font color="#E5E5E5"> sadly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> denied denied</font>

649
00:27:52,149 --> 00:28:00,789
again denied denied so enough about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

650
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:04,450
so cyber security assurance do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

651
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:07,179
you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it if you are a small</font>

652
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:09,340
business and you don't have any other

653
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:11,320
means of protecting yourself I think it

654
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:14,709
makes a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sense small medium-sized</font>

655
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:16,840
businesses probably large businesses

656
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,490
though they have the potential to do

657
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,870
what's called self insurance right they

658
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,519
don't necessarily up the self in church

659
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:23,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">purchase portion that risk they can</font>

660
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:26,409
self-insure for the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> list and take</font>

661
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:28,330
it upon themselves for example home

662
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:30,340
depot they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have absorbed the</font>

663
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:32,980
entire millions of dollars of loss from

664
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,360
that breach that did not put them out of

665
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,889
business as a matter of fact there have

666
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,479
been very few cyber security breaches

667
00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:39,399
that have actually put<font color="#E5E5E5"> any company out</font>

668
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,710
of business there was one company up in

669
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:43,928
I think was New Jersey there were

670
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:45,519
Japanese owned subsidiary they got

671
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:47,799
reached a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago this was at</font>

00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,929
anions talk we went over that pickup

673
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:53,860
breached it was bad enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Japanese</font>

674
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:55,659
company said we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't we it just</font>

675
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,519
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense even continue anymore</font>

676
00:28:55,659 --> 00:29:00,039
they shot the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole division down it was</font>

677
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,720
gone off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> face of here same thing</font>

it's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> small amount we're talking</font>

about these dollars can potentially be

00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:35,020
and make that argument now so<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving on</font>

720
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:38,350
with a problem way over time on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

721
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:41,290
piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I did geek out of it so this</font>

722
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:44,110
this emerging legal trend is something

723
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:46,840
you may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have heard of so California</font>

724
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:49,689
California loves to regulate California

00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,429
has an attorney general<font color="#CCCCCC"> attorney general</font>

727
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:58,030
breaches that are affecting California

728
00:30:54,010 --> 00:31:00,040
citizens hey guess what we think that

729
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:01,480
California citizens there's already an

730
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,149
obligation in the law says you need to

731
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">take reasonable precautions to protect</font>

California citizens against data breach

733
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:11,320
guess what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means to us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sands</font>

734
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:13,930
critical security controls better out a

735
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,050
framework and a better reply why does

736
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:18,070
this matter do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you people in Tennessee</font>

737
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:21,820
well because there's no attorney in the

738
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:25,419
room I will fill you in so do any of

739
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:28,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">your companies have customers that are</font>

00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:35,020
state of California maybe well

743
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,310
California's get around right it's one

744
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,070
of the most populous states in the Union

745
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:40,720
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sadly they travel all the time can</font>

00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep them out so they eventually make</font>

747
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,420
their way to Tennessee they probably buy

748

stuff from you and probably get on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

everywhere you're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

751
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:52,090
California Civil Procedure tells you

752
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:54,610
that if you have continuous contacts of

753

that state that justifies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> state to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">cybersecurity and guess what that means</font>

757
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,830
that means you better have a darn

758
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:08,050
framework in a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> tie back in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

759

760
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:12,000
security controls

761
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:15,420
actually they pick sands right Sands has

762
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,210
128 ish sub controls not the worst it's

763
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:21,200
not like the pic missed 853<font color="#E5E5E5"> which had</font>

764
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:25,830
700 800 controls but you get the point

765
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:28,620
better have a framework anybody deal

766
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:31,110
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York this law probably does not</font>

767
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:32,580
apply to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it only applies to</font>

768
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:36,179
certain entities that are in the

769
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:40,280
financial services in New York however

770
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:42,450
he I'll skip to the punch line however

771
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,790
there are lots of state regulatory

772
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:47,370
agencies that like what New York<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

773
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:49,530
done here with this law and they're

774
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:51,540
considering implementing laws of their

775
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:54,570
own I think Colorado has one teed up

776
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:56,940
right now yeah it is it's the Colorado

777

Department of regulatory agencies

778
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,590
division securities they're considering

779
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:04,200
implementing a rule like this that would

780
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:07,260
apply to California companies in some

781
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,240
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> shape or form you know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

782
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,310
it's not just publicly traded companies

00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,350
and financial institutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> states have a regulatory agency</font>

793
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:33,330
adopt some crazy thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like</font>

whether you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the title or not and</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> per the California law actually</font>

801
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,820
says the seesaw has to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the board</font>

802
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:54,480
which I personally think that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

803
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:56,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing but it's a requirement right it's</font>

804
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a nice to have anymore for these</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you it's coming elsewhere and it's going</font>

807
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:06,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">to slowly make its way around to every</font>

808
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,520
state so eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not going not</font>

809
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:11,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to have to have a framework</font>

810
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,509
you're going to have to see so the sea

811
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,610
so is going to have to be talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

812
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:18,330
board I<font color="#E5E5E5"> personally welcome this kind of</font>

813
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:19,710
I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is stuff we want</font>

814
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:22,580
right we want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> having these</font>

815
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:24,710
conversations well whether you

816
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:26,750
whether you're in that camp with me or

817
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:31,190
not you're going to be in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> camp</font>

818
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:32,989
eventually so take a step<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and talk</font>

819
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:35,000
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> publicly traded entities for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,340
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this act when in 2002 2003 I</font>

822
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,990
believe it took in fact you've got

823
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,060
criminal penalties that can affect your

824
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:47,060
your c-level executives particularly

<font color="#E5E5E5">your CIO and CFO they're signing off on</font>

00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:55,489
to the SEC<font color="#E5E5E5"> you also had the creation of</font>

the Public Company Accounting Oversight

829
00:34:55,489 --> 00:35:02,680
Board boy that's a mouthful and out of

830
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:04,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">that what happened was they leveraged</font>

831
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,140
the committee of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sponsoring</font>

833
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,520
which actually came into effect back in

834
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:14,779
the 80s to deal with fraud rajala

835
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:16,730
financial reporting so this accounting

836
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:19,310
oversight board<font color="#E5E5E5"> and co sewn together</font>

837
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:20,720
there's a framework of internal controls

838
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:22,610
that are supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide reasonable</font>

839
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,109
assurance right reasonable assurance

840
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:26,960
that what appears on your financial

841
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:29,720
statements to protect investors is there

842
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">because the data all along the way is</font>

843
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,980
correct and the people that signed off

844
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:36,350
on it did all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right things and the</font>

845
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,420
people that that had access to the

846
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:41,210
phones did all the right things and

847
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:44,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're reporting you're not making</font>

848
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:46,100
material misstatements to the public so

849
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,870
that the investors are protected right

850
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:51,140
it's a level<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing field in theory all</font>

851
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:53,680
the investors<font color="#CCCCCC"> are protected by socks so</font>

852
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,759
that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an mci worldcom or</font>

853
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,890
who's the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> one was in Iran right</font>

854
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,500
you know so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have another one of</font>

855
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:04,129
those come down the pike and what

856
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:06,400
happens is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Sokka said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great we've</font>

857
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:09,260
got this<font color="#E5E5E5"> framework it's called tobit</font>

858
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,020
control objectives for information

859
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:14,150
related technologies if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use in cove</font>

860
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,980
it we think that relates back to what

861
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:18,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">coso has for internal controls you don't</font>

862
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:21,740
have to use cobit but you have to have a

863
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:24,620
framework so again it goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to there</font>

864
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:27,620
must be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a framework in place so if you</font>

865
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:30,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have a framework pick one I don't</font>

866
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:34,960
care<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is ISO 27001 27,000 to</font>

867
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:38,400
covet fans missed

868
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,660
a framework and implement it because

869
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,570
you're only doing good things for

870
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:47,170
yourself sec so if anything about the

871
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:49,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">SEC they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they doubled in size since Sox</font>

872
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:51,760
went into place and they have their own

873
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:55,330
regulations that they've promulgated to

874
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,250
protect once again investors and to make

875
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:59,290
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these broker-dealers which can</font>

876
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,910
be some kind sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

877
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:03,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">shady make sure they're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

878
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:07,000
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you know with your money</font>

879
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,500
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all this is all good right so</font>

880
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,280
the thing that's happened though

881
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:15,070
recently is that 2014 they decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

882
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,450
start just just we're gonna take it take

883
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:18,369
a dip we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take a sample they</font>

884
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:20,319
took about 50 companies these<font color="#E5E5E5"> both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

885
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:21,820
the others these advisory companies they

886
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,640
said let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the state of</font>

887
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:26,950
your cyber security<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they peeled back</font>

888
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,069
the map and what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> found under the</font>

889
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:32,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">mask oh man this is not good stuff that</font>

890
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:34,390
we found come these guys don't even<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

891
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:38,080
the basics down so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened in</font>

892
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:40,598
February 2015 is they said hey here's

893
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,670
another risk alert here's what we

894
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:44,470
consider to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the basics you've got to</font>

895
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:46,450
have governance and some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of risk</font>

896
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,669
assessment and oh by the way they said

897
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:50,348
the same thing you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to c so c so</font>

898
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:52,060
it's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking the board you</font>

899
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:54,099
need to have access rights you know

900
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone for anything right you guys need</font>

901
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:57,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have some kind of access rights and</font>

902
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:59,500
controls you need to have some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

903
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:01,780
dlp going on you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have your</font>

904
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party vendors you gotta wrangle</font>

905
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:06,010
them and you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to train your humans</font>

906
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:08,560
because it's completely out of control

907
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:12,220
so expect that the SEC<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to</font>

908
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,720
continue to to dive deeper with the

909
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,790
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are directly under their</font>

910
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:18,399
control and that's going to have ripple

911
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:21,310
effect similar basically basically if

912
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,640
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not getting the story yet the</font>

913
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:25,740
story is how to see so get a framework

914
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:29,770
start doing the right stuff

915
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:32,200
documentation all that all that great

916
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:35,200
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what happens when when</font>

917
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,339
companies that have stocks do bad things

918
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,899
what happens we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a material</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">misstatement well okay Yahoo Yahoo was</font>

about the merge with when Verizon

921
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,740
Verizon was going to buy the mouth close

922
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,990
to five billion dollars

923
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:52,660
just as verizon was about to cross<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

924
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:54,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">finish line with that sale we found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

927
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:04,930
couple weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> later we heard you know it</font>

928
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:06,910
was actually a billion so four billion

929
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:09,430
dollars and verizon said well we're

930
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:11,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to write down or what we think</font>

931
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:14,919
your company is worth<font color="#E5E5E5"> buying to the tune</font>

932
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:17,440
of what two say 350 million dollars

933
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,560
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not bad really when you</font>

934
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,180
considered average cost of a breach

935
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:25,210
average cost per record loss that's

936
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:26,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably you know if I got to put a</font>

00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:28,600
finger up in the air<font color="#CCCCCC"> and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of catch</font>

938
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,790

telling us all these great stories this

944
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:45,160
breach goes back to 2013 you say we're

945
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:48,869
going to investigate<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and then what</font>

946
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:51,700
happens Yahoo shareholders they<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this white knight investor</font>

00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,580
they're waiting for this verizon deal to

952
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,320
go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can unload the stock and</font>

953
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,029
now all of a sudden the rug<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been</font>

954
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,690
yank alpha<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mona mean my stock is still</font>

worth crap you suck yahoo i'm going to

956
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:12,580
sue you so another class action lawsuit

957
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,440
this is what's called a shareholder

958
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:16,480
derivative suit it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the board</font>

959
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,850
of directors and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the c-level executives</font>

960
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,790
they have not protected the shareholders

961
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:24,310
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest why because we didn't get</font>

962
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:28,960
our cybersecurity straight and we made

963
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:31,090
material misstatements to the LCC so bad

964
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,490
things happen if you issue shares and

965
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:35,200
people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what happens to the</font>

966
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:36,549
price of those shares and they find some

967
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,040
way to tie it back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a breach that's</font>

968
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:41,020
happening your company the other lesson

969
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:45,660
learned out of this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for mergers</font>

970
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:49,480
and acquisitions you must always always

971
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:51,430
do your due diligence I have no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">this breach candlelight too late</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't okay maybe somebody</font>

974
00:40:55,990 --> 00:41:00,669
verizon found it I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> but my</font>

975
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,960
guess is that if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were digging hard</font>

976
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:05,040
enough

977
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,940
they would count any of your company's

978
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:11,009
go through to growth by acquisition

1008
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:38,040
right she can't be responsible for

1009

everything but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then again and she's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">because it's so well-known so anybody</font>

all right why does your state why does

1018
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,839
the state of Alabama<font color="#CCCCCC"> suck because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:12,150
states left that have not enacted a data

00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:18,710
I don't know what's up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them but if</font>

1024
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,900
you see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bama fan out there give them</font>

1028
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:31,550

1029
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:34,700
so almost all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these states have an</font>

1030
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:36,860
attorney general sometimes these data

1031
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,689
breach notification laws give private

1032
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:40,580
citizens the right to pursue actions

1033
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:42,410
against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company but in most case it</font>

1034
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:44,690
says the Attorney General can pursue

1035
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:46,279
action against you so what happens is if

1036
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:47,960
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a breach and you got customers</font>

1037
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,640
from all these different states all of

1038
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:53,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">these state attorney general's get on</font>

1039

board and say know what I'm a lawyer and

1040
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:59,270
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't sued anybody today it's a good</font>

1041
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:02,720
day to sue you because you lost your

stuff that belongs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my citizens and</font>

1043
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,049
we're going to find you use that the

1044
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:09,560
phone my regulatory agency so that we

1045
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:10,430
can continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> an out purpose in life the</font>

1046
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,320
other thing these data breach

1047
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:14,299
notification statute students there's

1048
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,100
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a safe harbor for encryption which</font>

1049
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,780
is good<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so if you're encrypting</font>

1050
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:20,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">their laptops you're doing the deed if</font>

1051
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:24,020
you're encrypting data in motion am at

1052
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:25,520
last it helps a lot many of these states

1053
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,620
they have a separate they have a

1054
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,910
separate statute that deals with social

1055
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:31,370
security so you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a one-two punch</font>

1056
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:32,870
right you can get a data breach suit and

1057
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:34,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">then also get sued from this handling</font>

1058
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:37,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">Social Security numbers that you've done</font>

1059
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:41,419
that but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the more interesting</font>

1060
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:43,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">parts of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is law enforcement homeless</font>

1061
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,930
and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use Tennessee's data</font>

1062
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:48,620
breach notification law as an

1063
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:51,710
illustration so almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of these</font>

1064
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:55,130
state notification except Bama Bama fans

1065
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:56,930
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> value almost all these state data</font>

1066
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:59,180
breach notification laws say you've got

1067
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:00,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">to notify these customers and most of</font>

1068
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:02,839
them set the threshold of the year 1000

1069
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,730
5000 before the statute goes into effect

1070
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,290
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if a thousand people are breached</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1071
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:08,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">five thousand you've got to do a</font>

1072
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:10,430
notification but they do give you a

1073
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:12,410
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a grace period to make a</font>

1074
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:14,569
reasonable investigation they also give

1075
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:16,490
you an out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost all of them there's</font>

1076
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:18,620
an out for law enforcement action so

1077
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:21,109
when when people are losing their minds

1078
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:22,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there are already</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten thousand</font>

1079
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:23,990
consultants descending upon you and

1080
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:25,040
vendors are ringing the phone's off the

1081
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:25,348
hook and you're in the middle of a

1082
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,259
breeze

1083
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:30,329
and you go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you know what I think</font>

1084
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:32,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need somebody else here in a war room</font>

1085
00:45:30,329 --> 00:45:35,789
to help us and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font>

1086
00:45:32,279 --> 00:45:37,109
FBI of the TBI and who knows maybe we'll

1087
00:45:35,789 --> 00:45:39,359
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Secret Service to it because</font>

1088
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:41,660
they've got a cyber enforcement agency

1089
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:44,609
so why not we'll just bring them all in

1090
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:47,729
and people are going to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at you like</font>

1091
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:49,529
you've grown<font color="#CCCCCC"> a third head it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already a</font>

1092
00:45:47,729 --> 00:45:54,149
crisis why do you want law enforcement

1093
00:45:49,529 --> 00:45:55,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">here well law enforcement means that</font>

1094
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:57,390
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to wait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for them to tell us</font>

1095
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:59,549
that they're done with their

1096
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:01,529
investigations so that we can inform<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1097
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:03,900
customers so if I'm good at clock

1098
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:05,789
management i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to call law</font>

1099
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:08,249
enforcement because they're already

1100
00:46:05,789 --> 00:46:11,519
buried and they're a government agency

1101
00:46:08,249 --> 00:46:13,950
and that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help me delay when I</font>

1102
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:15,238
need to do notification so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> throwing</font>

1111
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:47,460
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know about because there</font>

1112
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,259
are 48 different statutes and they all

1113
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,619
say something different<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes back to</font>

preparation right if you haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> already</font>

1115
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:56,700
downloaded know what each of those

1116
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:59,099
statutes do and how those notifications

1117
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,288
role and what you can do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

1118
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:03,390
states and we can't do and who can sue

1119
00:47:01,289 --> 00:47:05,339
you for fines and who can't and who can

1120
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:07,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring you gotta know you gotta do the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">preparation or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hiring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> outside counsel</font>

1122
00:47:07,049 --> 00:47:11,640
that has already done this prep work

1123
00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:14,999
because when you get breached you need

1124
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:17,219
to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff second thing about</font>

1125
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:21,209
those is that usually what happens

1126
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:22,380
during breach is lawyers like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said</font>

1127
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:23,579
we're there are no lawyers in the room

1128
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">so nobody's going to get them and</font>

1129
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:27,779
lawyers smell blood<font color="#CCCCCC"> and water any time</font>

1130
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:30,689
something bad happens to<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody else</font>

1131
00:47:27,779 --> 00:47:32,519
lawyers sense blood they're like sharks

1132
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:35,369
I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> analogy has been made</font>

1133
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:36,660
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> than all claim they will come</font>

1134
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:38,119
they will find what's called a

1135
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:40,038
representative

1136
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:43,309
that represents the entire class of

1137
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:45,559
people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been breached and they</font>

1138
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:47,089
will file a lawsuit this pesky lawyer as

1139
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:48,920
well and they will drag you into<font color="#CCCCCC"> court</font>

1140

00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:01,038
representative<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the class in each of</font>

1146
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:03,109
those states pile that all together and

1147
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:04,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">then because we got so many people let's</font>

1148
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:06,440
have fun we're not going to do this in

1149
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:07,940
all the state coin so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put</font>

1150
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:12,009
it together in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one big suit and we're</font>

1151
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:14,329
going to file it in federal court where

1152
00:48:12,009 --> 00:48:15,710
there's kind of an accelerated docket

1153
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:17,619
and things move a little more speedily

1154
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:20,779
than all these different state venues

1155
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:23,390
that's what lawyers do that's what they

1156
00:48:20,779 --> 00:48:24,799
get paid to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something bad happens</font>

1157
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:26,180
the people they go to the lawyer the

00:48:24,799 --> 00:48:28,038
<font color="#CCCCCC">lawyer takes their little piece of it</font>

1159
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:29,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then they give you you get like a</font>

it's five million seems fair anyway so

1164
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:44,749
let's look at the my<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite example</font>

1172
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:10,849
there's a problem called standing in a

1173

lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> jurisdictions now they'll say hey</font>

1174
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:14,739
just because your data was breached

1175
00:49:12,499 --> 00:49:16,939
doesn't mean that you can show a

1176
00:49:14,739 --> 00:49:20,529
recognizable injury to the court your

1177

00:49:35,989 --> 00:49:39,589
for a little bit different with the with

1186

the home depot case and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

1187
00:49:39,589 --> 00:49:47,690
different with these PCI cases because

1188
00:49:42,339 --> 00:49:49,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay Joe Schmo that gets breached he may</font>

not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to prove</font>

00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:55,489
recognizable injury to the court right

1191
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:57,470
but these issuing banks and their banks

1192
00:49:55,489 --> 00:49:59,960
right banks have a lot of money banks

1193
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:02,089
have attorneys he's issuing banks that

1194
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:04,369
are on the hook to reissue all these

1195
00:50:02,089 --> 00:50:07,400
credit cards with all the costs

1196
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:08,989
attendant to that to get mad they get

1197
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,299
really really mad<font color="#CCCCCC"> at these merchants</font>

1198
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:15,170
that lose the data and have blown it

1199
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:18,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">with PCI so what happens a bank sue or</font>

1200
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:21,619
their insurance companies do right and

1201
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:23,869
those cases they do ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> them because</font>

1202

they<font color="#E5E5E5"> shout out a crap ton of money to</font>

1203
00:50:23,869 --> 00:50:28,730

1204
00:50:26,509 --> 00:50:31,309
it into this wonderful<font color="#E5E5E5"> floor chart which</font>

00:50:34,609 --> 00:50:40,009
as cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> progress through this civil</font>

1208

00:50:44,859 --> 00:50:51,230
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> defendant to basically say so</font>

1212
00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:52,730

1224
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:19,849
motion to dismiss it's fantastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:25,099
called discovery and during discovery

1227

cost for the defending company so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,680
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through discovery because</font>

1238
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:52,430
what's on the other side of discovery

1239
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,140
discovery<font color="#E5E5E5"> is never going to lead to a</font>

1287
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,230
two cases that came down recently i

1288
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:57,049
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> was there was one late in the fall</font>

1289
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:59,450
last year<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was the largest settlement</font>

1290
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:00,650
to settlement to date cuz they brought

1291
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:01,879
an enforcement action it's the same

1292
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:04,130
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right if it goes to discover</font>

1293
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,110
you're screwed because nobody approves

1294
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:08,570
all the budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing a breach blah blah</font>

1295
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:11,210
blah anyway so people settle once again

1296
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:13,700
with regulatory agencies largest

1297
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:14,869
was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5.5 million dollars and there</font>

1298
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:17,540
was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just came out a couple</font>

1299
00:54:14,869 --> 00:54:20,300
weeks ago that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was right up there just</font>

1300
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:21,410
squeaked in under it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case that</font>

1301
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:23,180
the case that had the largest

1302
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:27,200
enforcement action I think it breached

1303
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:30,759
three times right okay you probably

1304
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:34,129
deserve to pay a 5.5 million dollar fine

1305
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:36,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">kept DC so the Federal Trade Commission</font>

1306
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:38,480

1307
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:40,640
actually kind of makes sense right FTC

1308
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,050
is full sole purpose in life is protect

1309
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,000
consumers consumers like you and me

1310
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:45,500
against bad things that happen the

1311
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,609

1313
00:54:48,609 --> 00:54:53,210
everybody in the room is consumer we

1314

1316
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,690

00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:02,599
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last year I've seen at least</font>

00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:05,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">three maybe four instances where the FTC</font>

1319

has brought action against the company

1320

1323
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:16,009
because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not good enough then just</font>

1324
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:19,339
have one regulatory agency<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the</font>

1326
00:55:19,339 --> 00:55:23,660
we're off to have multiple agencies

that were involved basically entity one

1342
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:01,580
was an ISP they outsource some of their

1343

isp i regulate you the third party

1345

breached your customers information but

1346

point of that regulation is about

privacy so if you are retaining

information about EU citizens and they

1413
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:03,200
want you to remove it you have to be

1414
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:06,140
able to show that there's a pretty darn

1415

good reason for holding<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to it they</font>

1417
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:16,400

that are IT security professionals you

1421
