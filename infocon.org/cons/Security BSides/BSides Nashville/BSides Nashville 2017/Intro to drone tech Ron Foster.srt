1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,679
how about that fantastic so if you came

2
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,540
here wanting to talk on how to hack

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,340
groans this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not it there's tons</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,680
info out there on that and really to be

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,630
honest you just need some type of spread

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,150
spectrum radio to interrupt the Wi-Fi

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,400
signal or the radio signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a drone to</font>

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,659
bring it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down it's got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a real big deal</font>

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,890
to hack<font color="#E5E5E5"> a drone and really when they</font>

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,390
talk about hacking drones these days

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,670
most the time it's just crashing drums

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,500
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> all you're doing and you</font>

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,980
know the FAA is actually starting to

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,930
crack down a lot on drones coming down

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,370
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good thing because I think</font>

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,430
they're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to figure out where</font>

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,379
drones live in the world at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point</font>

18
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,489
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is mainly going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

19
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,250
if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get started in</font>

20
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,169
multirotors or drones what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

21
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do you want to build you want to buy</font>

22
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,469
what are some of the pain points I've

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,960
went through over the years how much

24
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,360
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> have I lost over the years which</font>

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">is great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> watching a craft</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kilala with a</font>

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,680
GoPro and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 400 are gimbal strapped to</font>

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,840
the bottom it makes you cry a little bit

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,090
inside so it's just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know those types</font>

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">of lessons but what's kind of we're</font>

30
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,850
talking about so you can start it to

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,400
multirotors fun and hacking and my name

32
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,189
is Ron Foster so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work for HP</font>

33
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,930
Enterprise soon to be microfocus<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

34
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,000
so it seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> every few months we</font>

35
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,229
turn into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new company I don't know</font>

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">what that's all about it that's kind of</font>

37
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,729
where we are and i'm a senior security

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,280
consultant I brakes done so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

39
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:33,390
really my job so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the multi</font>

40
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">rudder for this talk we're going to</font>

41
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:40,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">really talk about UAVs but you know in</font>

42
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,090
general a drone is anything you control

43
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,710
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> little samurai drones of the</font>

44
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,909
house that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know jump up on couches</font>

45
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,350
and you can run them around the

46
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,560
neighborhood and they're a blast we've

47
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:52,408
got quadrotors we got hex rotors we've

48
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,670
have all kinds of toy robotic things at

49
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:58,380
the house and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can control them</font>

50
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:00,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a remote Fitz's around and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for me</font>

51
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,520
the insanity is how much things change

52
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,619
in six months when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gave this you know</font>

53
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,929
target freaknic last year<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> october</font>

54
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,970
six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago roughly literally</font>

55
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,890
everything has changed in drones once

56
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,660
again it's not

57
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:14,540
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of crazy to me how fast</font>

58
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:17,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything goes but a autonomous vs.</font>

59
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,980
piloted this is a cheerson CX<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 to me</font>

60
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:21,589
it's a very popular aircraft because

61
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,030
it's Audrina based it's dirt cheap you

62
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,800
can have a ship for China for a couple

63
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,870
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> bucks and because it's Audrina</font>

64
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,130
vase that means it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hackers dream I</font>

65
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,290
mean you literally plug it into your

66
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,490
laptop using software called mission

67
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,170
planner and you have access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to every</font>

68
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">parameter on the aircraft you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

69
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:38,000
whatever you want to it and it's it's a

70
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,060
great toy to begin crashing early on

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,290
because really drones is about crashing

72
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,910
one thing you notice is like on this

73
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">guy's one of my home bills he has a red</font>

74
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:48,920
arm and a yellow are that's because it

75
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,780
was all white and then we switch to

76
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,809
yellow arms and then after we crashed it

77
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,790
again then we ran out of yellow arms and

78
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,350
now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a red arm and when I break</font>

79
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,910
something else that'll be a red arm<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

80
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,560
because it's one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

81
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,790
drones is you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cry it's just</font>

82
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:08,989
a fact of life and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break</font>

83
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:10,370
stuff so uses when we look at drones you

84
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,410
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right now how they're being used</font>

85
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">people think of military of course we</font>

86
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,790
know that we use drones to you know drop

87
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,530
things from the sky and<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things go</font>

88
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,810
boom that's the standard things that we

89
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,040
do we all season for surveillance but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

90
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,829
the commercial world we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for</font>

91
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,679
survey we use them<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> search-and-rescue</font>

92
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:30,110
it's a very popular thing videography

93
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,510
you know for a while when the FCC and

94
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,940
the FAA and all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are trying</font>

95
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">to figure out how all this works and was</font>

96
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,680
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of illegal to fly a drone or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> charge</font>

97
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:41,120
for drone stuff so your legal fly that's

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">charged we would say well we're not</font>

99
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,230
charging here for the drone flying we're

100
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,369
charging for the video editing and kind

101
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,798
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting around stuff a little bit</font>

102
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,390
there agriculture is becoming a very hot

103
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,110
thing if you've ever looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the SG</font>

104
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:56,480
that the asci the 10000 series aircraft

105
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,340
they're using it for crop dusting now so

106
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,810
little they can send it up and dust a

107
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,549
crop of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drone and they met building</font>

108
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,680
maps are hardly fly they can program and

109
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:05,209
waypoints and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you fly from here to</font>

110
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,120
here here to here here to here come back

111
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:10,220
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> land yourself go and they just sit</font>

112
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,260
back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> watch it do its thing so it's</font>

113
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty cool thing and the aircraft I</font>

114
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,950
showed you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning it will do that</font>

115
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:17,478
as well it's fully Waypoint programmable

116
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,779
you know couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred bucks like I</font>

117
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:23,070
said it's fantastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tori and hacking</font>

118
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:25,200
sure we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Pringles can and</font>

119
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,210
you know build ourselves a little

120
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cantina but even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it more fun to strap a</font>

121
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,780
Raspberry Pi with<font color="#CCCCCC"> callie running on it</font>

122
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,640
and landing on top of the little

123
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,130
two-story ability and sit down there

124
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,840
were your laptop and you know have some

125
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,300
fun gentle in that pen I mean it's just

126
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know yeah we we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to do</font>

127
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,600
that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fun and you know if we're</font>

128
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,860
going to do what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do let's make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it fun</font>

129
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,360
if that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> really life's all about</font>

130
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,880
it's not just about breaking stuff

131
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">having fun breaking stuff so can we talk</font>

132
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:54,360
about our<font color="#E5E5E5"> drones payloads is a great</font>

133
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:56,130
thing to look at so types of multirotors

134
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,060
this is a hex rudder my daughter Keith

135
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked me when I'm going to build an</font>

136
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,890
octave rotor and I keep telling her when

137
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,360
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> get more money because going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font>

138
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,950
hex rotor to akhter odor I've noticed

139
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">just purchasing frame two links you want</font>

140
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:11,940
to build them yourself talking a $25 $30

141
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:14,130
kit to 700 800 dollars for a frame so

142
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,469
it's it jumps ups considerably we start

143
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at dr. rudders so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

144
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,640
focus on hex<font color="#CCCCCC"> rudders I've excuse me</font>

145
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,469
quadrotors mainly for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top but this</font>

146
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,729
is a hex rudder and one thing you'll

147
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,230
notice is when you're flying these

148
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,790
things orientation is a big thing so

149
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why I also have the color arms in</font>

150
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,540
the front that lets me know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

151
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">front of the aircraft so orientation I</font>

152
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,080
don't crash it because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

153
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:40,169
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forward and back so it's a</font>

154
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,810
bad thing also so in quadrotors i love

155
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,160
it when I give people rotors or want to

156
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">for Christmas and holidays I'm always</font>

157
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,400
the drone guy I'm always giving people

158
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,500
drones and the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do is</font>

159
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,719
specially little pocket roads is they'll

160
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,860
crash it they'll knock a rotor off and

161
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,210
we'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> grab something out of the</font>

162
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,270
package and stick it on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then when</font>

163
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,039
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on it goes for like what</font>

164
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,930
happened it's a piece of junk why'd you

165
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">give me this crap you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

166
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,890
well you probably want to look at that

167
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">a.m. when we see each other we have</font>

168
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">coffee or whatever it will take a look</font>

169
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,870
at it see what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the reason why</font>

170
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">is there's different configurations</font>

171
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,500
there's quad and then there's Claude X

172
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,060
we just called plus or<font color="#E5E5E5"> X configurations</font>

173
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,770
and if you notice there's a green and

174
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">blue color on the slide and the reason</font>

175
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:21,180
is is because one rotating clockwise and

176
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,040
the others rotating counterclockwise and

177
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,700
you have to have them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the proper</font>

178
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,140
pattern or it's not going to fly so same

179
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,400
with these so if you you're all going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

180
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,990
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to look at this after the show</font>

181
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,729
you'll see that the rotors themselves

182
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,160
are either pitched this way or pitch

183
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,920
this way and they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on the</font>

184
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,540
proper order

185
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,650
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to fly and usually we can</font>

186
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">only bring it to me we just pop the</font>

187
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:46,299
right writer on it takes write-offs not

188
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:48,340
a problem so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a</font>

189
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-rotor we have to start thinking</font>

190
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:54,700
about parts and really the biggest thing

191
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:56,469
you have to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weight every</font>

192
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">single thing that you plan on strapping</font>

193
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,650
on to this thing has to be weighed and

194
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,110
you have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because you have to</font>

195
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">calculate the thrust of the motors that</font>

196
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,860
you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a little</font>

197
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,480
math it's not complicated as a fuzzy

198
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,430
math<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to get it going but we do have</font>

199
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,470
to purchase our frame we have to

200
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,120
purchase things called<font color="#E5E5E5"> ESC yes these are</font>

201
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,590
electronic speed controllers that these

202
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys here and I'm a lover of zip ties</font>

203
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,549
and I just dip time to the bottom and

204
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">those control the speed at which the</font>

205
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,120
motors go so when I push up on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stick</font>

206
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,710
it tells the flight controller to give

207
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,180
that thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> more juice and the electronic</font>

208
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,370
speed controller feeds the motor more

209
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,140
juice that's all it<font color="#CCCCCC"> does the motors</font>

210
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,940
themselves there are basically two types

211
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,219
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> motors are brushed motor and a</font>

212
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,560
brushless motor of course a brushed

213
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,260
motor has little brushes inside and if

214
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,910
you've ever owned a VW Beetle you point

215
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,590
your life I'm a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little older I've had a</font>

216
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,790
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them may be hit by a train and</font>

217
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,280
one that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another story for another day</font>

218
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,720
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> a they don't have all day they have</font>

219
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,429
generators and inside there are brushes

220
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,500
and your brushes wear out over the time

221
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,570
so you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually go in and replace</font>

222
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,410
the rushers on your on your generator so

223
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,330
it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing with a brushed</font>

224
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,280
motors if you buy brushed motor be

225
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,840
prepared<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the brushes to wear out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

226
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,669
you don't really fix those you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

227
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,289
replace them so instead people go with

228
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,330
brushless motors these are brushless and

229
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,490
you don't have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem the motors</font>

230
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,490
last much much longer they're also going

231
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:11,170
to be more<font color="#CCCCCC"> expensive but there's so many</font>

232
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,330
kits on ebay now to get started with

233
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:16,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's really not an issue power</font>

234
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,740
distribution so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is power</font>

235
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,180
distribution when you come up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

236
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,280
at this the cool thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like about</font>

237
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,040
these specific kids is the board

238
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,010
themselves is basically just a big you

239
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,540
know already pre-cut board so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can go</font>

240
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,650
in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solder points on</font>

241
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,450
the board so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we think of power</font>

242
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,250
distribution from the battery it's

243
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:35,260
already on here otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can just</font>

244
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,299
take wires and build a harness we have

245
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,789
to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to get power from here</font>

246
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:40,929
to all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these motors so you have to</font>

247
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,719
have some type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of power distribution</font>

248
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:45,760
frame or units to do that and in this

249
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,700
case it's just part of the board

250
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,930
the controller when you come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look</font>

251
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,690
at this as well there's a tiny little

252
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,680
bored seated on here and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

253
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,880
the flight controller we're going to

254
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,010
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next couple of slides about</font>

255
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,240
different types of flight controllers

256
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:02,360
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my favorites to get started with</font>

257
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:05,810
and some of the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular as far as</font>

258
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,640
in the commercial market telemetry so

259
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,819
telemetry is kind of important it's

260
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,980
these days I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more important</font>

261
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,930
we've all heard the story<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was on the</font>

262
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,270
news<font color="#E5E5E5"> everywhere about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a year ago about</font>

263
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,560
some guy was flying a drone over

264
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,939
someone's house he<font color="#E5E5E5"> said hey you were</font>

265
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,790
looking at my daughter he took his shot

266
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,510
gun and he shot it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the sky so</font>

267
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:25,339
first of all lots of things have changed

268
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">since</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then from a legal standpoint to</font>

269
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:28,820
help prevent that but one of the things

270
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,250
are frustrated me about that case was

271
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:34,250
the guys he showed up with flight data

272
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,650
off of his aircraft he had the telemetry

273
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,270
data office so he when the guy said<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey</font>

274
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,949
you're flying at this hype and you were

275
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,990
hovering he<font color="#CCCCCC"> could say no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual</font>

276
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,820
flight<font color="#CCCCCC"> log shall I was flying at this</font>

277
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,350
distance and<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this rate of speed and</font>

278
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,570
the court would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not even use it as</font>

279
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:50,330
admissible evidence so that kind of

280
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,830
frustum has a drone pilots<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like the</font>

courts are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not on my side at least at</font>

282
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,710
this point because they won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even look</font>

283
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,079
at evidence it's actually flight data

284
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,280
coming from my aircraft but telemetry is

285
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,050
an important<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to consider when</font>

286
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,449
you're if you're going to build or even

287
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,010
buy because it may be something help

288
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,690
protect you in the future because most

289
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:08,030
telemetry systems will record flight

290
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:11,330
data for you and telemetry for this

291
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:12,949
thing its twenty bucks I mean the parts

292
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,480
are so cheap now it's not even funny you

293
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,339
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> build an aircraft just like this for</font>

294
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,520
under three hundred dollars now I mean

295
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:21,200
the cost has come down so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much if you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">had a sip three years ago and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

298
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,390
would have cost me well over a thousand

299
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:30,740
dollars to build so it's really insane

300
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:33,589
rxtx<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're looking at receivers and</font>

314
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,880
everyone is building new types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

315
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,160
controllers that are really adopting the

just dropping in price a transmitter

that three years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would have paid</font>

320
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,730
for five hundred dollars for you can buy

321
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,340
equivalent now for 80 bucks so it's just

322
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,590
the cost continues to come down and you

323
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:26,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the fun factor continues to go up</font>

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me so when looking controllers I've</font>

325
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,340
mentioned before about the one aircraft

326
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,220
the beginning that's using an APM now a

327
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:35,200
PMS or an Adreno based system they're

328
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">there they're fantastic they were made</font>

329
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,160
by a company called 3d robotics and they

330
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,890
produced<font color="#CCCCCC"> the drone for a while called</font>

331
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,510
the solo drone or the drone solo it was

332
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:46,480
an absolute market nightmare and

333
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:49,020
disaster for them they were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

334
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,850
compete against a company called DJI and

335
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:54,069
when you go I mean you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy a phantom</font>

336
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,920
drone at walmart now we kind of know DG

337
00:11:54,070 --> 00:12:00,160
is kind of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> their the generic drone</font>

338
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,349
company to beat but a they've marketed

339
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,270
this drone if you didn't know how to

340
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,250
tweak it and play with it it was really

341
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:09,310
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good drone for you but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because it</font>

creation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I loved it and because of that</font>

347
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:27,099
receivers telemetry everything is a kit

348
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,050
thirty-five forty dollars and that's

349
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,850
pretty much the brains of your multi

351
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:36,790
is a base two controllers of that type

352

is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I want to build a a copter</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">we want to remote control the cool thing</font>

about the Audrina based system and at

358
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,720
least of 3d robotics built is when you

359
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:52,030
plug it into your computer using their

360
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,350
software called mission planner it says

361
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,420
hey what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with this</font>

with all the preset stuff and you just

367
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,730
go in and tweak them after the

368
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,019
act so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have from driving a car</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-rotor but really cool stuff in a</font>

374
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:18,610
really great place to get started so

375
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:20,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">naza so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> miles and controllers are</font>

376
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:24,100
very popular and that's a DG I based

377
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,050
controller and basically by if you want

378
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">to build your own phantom this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

379
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:31,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">much where you're going to go personally</font>

380
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:33,729
I don't buy nods of controllers because

381
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,980
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> goodbye final be done with it I</font>

382
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,140
mean why spend your money buying a

383
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,910
controller that you know in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

384
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,370
beginning they had the had a little

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,560
multi rotor kit you could buy when the

386
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,510
Phantom's were you know what i would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

387
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,390
overly expensive but now that you can

388
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:51,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a phantom 3 pro with a five</font>

kilometer range with full library

391
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,200
doesn't really make sense to go the

novel multiwii this is actually running

393

on multi weed multi we should just a

394
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:06,459

barometric pressure sensors to know how

401
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,630
far it is from the ground you've got to

402
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,680
fly it and personally I think everyone

403
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,140
it really wants to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into drones</font>

404

that's where you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start is really</font>

405
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:31,660
learning how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fly it and toys are your</font>

406
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,310
your best option because you don't want

of cool toiling totally raid multi

writers out there but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I would</font>

410
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,939
definitely start with toys kk to there

00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,529
another great<font color="#E5E5E5"> really inexpensive chief</font>

412
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,670
controller and I have a little LCD panel

413
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:46,870
built right into them so you can

414
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,459
literally<font color="#CCCCCC"> just before you put your top</font>

415

plate on just do all your programming

416
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:52,390
right there have your props off of your

417
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:54,279
motors test everything out make sure

418
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:56,410
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> good to go both everything together</font>

419
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:59,529
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside of your flight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> test and it's</font>

420
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:01,959
a really cheap reward cc3d they're the

on there you just plug it in and you can

00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,209
always like looking at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> controllers</font>

they get them like a mitosis really nice

because I work I have a family and you

<font color="#CCCCCC">much of pressure sensors I think it's</font>

449
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,680
hilarious and I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pressure sensors are huge</font>

455
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:19,610
in these types of devices if we're not

00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,200
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS they detect the barometric</font>

457

pressure and when you buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">says its height hold all it means it has</font>

459
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,730
a very much a pressure sensor so it

460
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,470
knows when it takes off what the

461
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:30,170
barometric pressure is and just stay

462
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:32,029
here so it doesn't mean it's got a drift

463
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,020
you know left right forward or backwards

464
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:35,510
but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay at that altitude</font>

465
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,800
because it goes I'm at this barometric

466
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:39,350
pressure level and this is where I

467
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,790
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be stay and for 15 bucks you know</font>

468
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,200
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> pocket drones have built in</font>

469
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,670
barometric pressure sensors you hit a

off<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sticks right here take your hand</font>

472
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,469
off the controller it's going to stick

473
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:56,000
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> here it makes flying way different</font>

474
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:58,640
than it was a year ago gps for wanting

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,800
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do any type of wavelength any type of</font>

return to home anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that nature</font>

477
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,059
than gps says are going to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical</font>

478
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,470
component most gps units now run about

479
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:08,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty-five thirty dollars if you're</font>

480
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,740
buying them separate and this one has a

481
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,890
header<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the board literally I just</font>

482
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:15,319
plug it in go back in program to use GPS

483
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:18,529
and then i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> gps at that point</font>

484
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:19,819
and with this one does have a barometric

485
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:22,099
pressure<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensor in it so it actually</font>

486
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:23,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't make a lot of sense to put GPS</font>

487
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:25,908
in this thing this is just my<font color="#CCCCCC"> flyer I</font>

488
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:27,259
break it all the time I do it as a demo

489
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:29,090
to show people if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to</font>

490
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:31,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">fly and even if you've been fighting</font>

491
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:34,070
them for years a good wind gust comes

492
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,689
and you've got no<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to handle that</font>

493
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,158
you've got no electronics no type of

494
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">software I handle that it's just going</font>

495
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:45,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crash and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> burn so this is my base</font>

496
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:48,200
flyer so we mentioned before about

497
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:50,689
payloads cameras are very popular

498
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,340
payload if GoPros and all the other

499
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,929
cameras we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen shot in the</font>

500
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,158
next one I'm some of the most pata you

501
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:57,620
know popular cameras that are out there

502
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,720
hacker payloads we have a raspberry PI's

503
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,250
you know and any other thing you must

504
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,000
strap to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom a daughter was joke</font>

505
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:07,549
in one day because i was actually way a

pineapple and seeing you know what's the

509
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:15,918
smallest battery<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could put in there to</font>

510
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,389
power the thing while I was actually

519
00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:40,100
a great video it's also a great way to

520
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:42,139
be visited by the FAA and lots of other

521
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,629
organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have abbreviations in</font>

522
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:46,039
their names at your house so I try to

523
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:47,539
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay away from playing with stuff</font>

524
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:51,200
like that but not putting it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube</font>

525
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:52,789
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just say that because you know we</font>

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,899
way out that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important thing</font>

all your passwords anyways get a NSA

532
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:08,090
guys hammer<font color="#E5E5E5"> pelo so GoPros you know what</font>

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,100
can you say about a go further there's

534
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,299
thinking fantastic there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just some</font>

535
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,908
of the best camera hardware out there

536
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:15,408
for what it does SJ cam if you're

537

cams<font color="#CCCCCC"> away to go I got</font>

540
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,600
of them and they're they're actually

541
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:26,120
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good cameras mobius mobius is</font>

542
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,280
like the most beautiful planet Mobius

543
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,050
gets you really eighty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of GoPro</font>

544
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,990
quality and it's a size of the key fob

545
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:38,930
of the alarm of your car they're super

546

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they come with an internal</font>

550
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">battery you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can look Levi capacitor for</font>

feeding the juice off into the capacitor

555
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,730
and feeding the camera and they have

556
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:00,110
extension modules with ribbon cables for

557
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,910
the camera so I can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> remove the</font>

camera element stick it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the front of</font>

with a piece of foam wedge and do my

570
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,020
thing hacker payloads<font color="#CCCCCC"> well we have a</font>

573
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">honest pi zeros now the way to go with</font>

574
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:36,649
hacker payloads and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things legal</font>

575
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,179
boards you know any little tiny<font color="#CCCCCC"> Audrina</font>

576
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">is I got tons of little microgreen knows</font>

577
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,270
now my problem is you know since you

578
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,470
can't you're limited by amount of code

579
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,870
you can run of those things to the

580
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:47,120
addressable memory that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's how</font>

581
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,800
much crap can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I fit on this tiny board</font>

582
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,570
and make it do stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my multi writer</font>

583
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,570
that's kind of where I'm at these days

584
00:20:53,470 --> 00:21:00,980
then we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the real fun stuff we get</font>

585
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:02,870
to legal so this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed a lot this</font>

586
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,110
is the model aircraft website and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

587
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:07,850
is generally all the rules associated

588
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:11,360
with model aircraft the funny thing is

589
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:13,040
Tennessee they really<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> straight on to</font>

590
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,840
figure out laws as well it used to be

591
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,720
completely one hundred percent illegal

592
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:21,370
to fly any<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-rotor in any state park</font>

593
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:24,490
and the laws go back to the old

594
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:26,830
aircraft days of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically you</font>

595
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:28,270
gasp alcohol powered airplanes that's

596
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,530
because they were loud they were noisy

597
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:35,760
and they did what I'm flying<font color="#E5E5E5"> parks</font>

598
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:38,770
that's not an issue anymore done it but

599
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,470
now the law says that you can petition

600
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:43,660
the manager of the state park you're

601
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:46,180
going to participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it and if they</font>

602
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:48,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">will allow you to fly you can fly your</font>

603
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:51,010
aircraft now which means you still can't

604
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,270
fly because I've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> been to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a state</font>

605
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,980
park where they allow you to fly your

aircraft<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I'm a real bit i'm</font>

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,360
period the aircraft's disabled and

693
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,699
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it rolls and they</font>

pre-program rules in the DG I products

unique keep the aircraft within visual

701
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:38,590
line of sight at all times yeah that's

702

and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not a good thing dignity</font>

706
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:50,970
but I you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it where you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

707
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:52,049
see it yes remain well clear and do not

708
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:53,999
interfere with manned aircraft

709
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:55,229
operations one of my favorite stories

710
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:57,269
from a year ago is when they had a

711
00:25:55,229 --> 00:25:59,429
forest fire and they had the picture of

712
00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:01,139
the c-130 he's carrying the payloads of

713
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:02,489
the flame retardant dropping on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

714
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:05,189
forest and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two drones sitting in</font>

715
00:26:02,489 --> 00:26:06,840
there the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the story was how</font>

716
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,190
another c-130 went up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they made him</font>

717
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,678
come home because they were afraid it

718
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:13,649
would suck the<font color="#CCCCCC"> aircraft into the engines</font>

719
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:16,049
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> damage the c-130 when they identify</font>

720
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:18,389
the pilots they find them forty thousand

721
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:20,759
dollars divided between two of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

722
00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:23,639
twenty thousand apiece for getting their

723
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:25,559
life's aerial photo of the wildfires so

724
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:28,168
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a great lesson learned</font>

725
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:31,289
for those guys so don't flatten your

726
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:33,239
other aircraft don't fly within five

727
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:35,129
miles an airport<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless you contact the</font>

728
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:36,779
airport control tower we're flying throw

729
00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:39,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">that out even though that's rule says</font>

730
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:40,739
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will stay on the website it's</font>

731
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,929
an incorrect rule don't find<font color="#E5E5E5"> an airport</font>

732
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:46,950
at all the only way you can do that is

733
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:48,690
if you become a certified pilot and it

734
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,429
used to a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago when I was liquid</font>

735
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,659
earliest i said i want to go full

736
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:53,399
commercial on this and i told my wife

737
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:54,419
it's gonna be like 15 20 thousand

738
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:56,279
dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've actually got to get my</font>

739
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:58,679
pilot's license and I after she's like

740
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:03,160
you were crazy no your hobby is becoming

741
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:06,560
stupid no not happening so

742
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:09,110
then the FAA comes out with the part 1

743
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,240
07 test so basically the book you would

744
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,459
study for your policy glam you still

745
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,440
have to learn that book but you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

746
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,240
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything else and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's pretty hard</font>

747
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,710
I've actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't go into the book</font>

748
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,330
and I've done some online classes that

749
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,840
guarantee you'll pass and I'm like

750
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:25,220
whatever it's for me I guess cuz I'm the

751
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,139
more grave that comes in there's a lot

752
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:29,480
of buffering and caching and you know

753
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,010
there's page faults and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've just</font>

754
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">realized stuff doesn't want to retain</font>

755
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way it used to but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh the part 1 07</font>

756
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,860
is the way we achieve this now very

757
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:38,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">inexpensively we're talking few hundred</font>

758
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:41,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">bucks for a test and then you are</font>

759
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:43,790
licensed by the FAA commercially to fly

760
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:45,800
so you would do just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real pilot</font>

761
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:47,899
you would actually fill out your form so

762
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,120
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> great for the state park guys oh</font>

763
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:53,990
I can't take off your part look at my

764
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">essay a waiver mmm while you want head</font>

765
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,560
with thing and the state park guys what

766
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,150
it is they can't block you from flying

767
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,340
in the part that can block you from

768
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:03,440
taking off in the park<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the problem</font>

769
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,899
is if I met a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge state park</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

770
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,150
hundreds of miles I can't take off from

771
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,710
the road<font color="#CCCCCC"> and go over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take over 45</font>

772
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,780
trees I've lost a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of sight on the</font>

773
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:15,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">aircraft and we've just violated rules</font>

774
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:17,629
so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that don't follow people are</font>

775
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,280
stadiums one of those horrible stories

776
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:21,560
are less<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure about the toddler who's</font>

777
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:24,110
neighbor lost control of his aircraft

778
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:28,520
and it hit the toddler in the eye and I

779
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:30,409
was gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> so a little little up to 18</font>

780
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,820
months two year old little girl lost

781
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:34,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">drive because the neighbor lost control</font>

782
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,870
of the ground that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a horrible freak</font>

783
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,639
accident but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why you've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

784
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:39,709
main control and if you're fine anywhere

785
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,600
near people they make prop guards and

786
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,070
they make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason and even will</font>

787
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,929
be unique breeze you buy it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes with</font>

788
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,399
prop guards in the box if you're flying

789
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">near</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people make sure using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your prop</font>

790
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,660
guards yes they add weight yes they

791
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,340
reduce your battery time yes all those

792
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,350
ugly things they<font color="#E5E5E5"> make me look like I</font>

793
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:59,060
minus all those things but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

794
00:28:54,350 --> 00:29:00,830
they're there for a reason don't fly an

795
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,510
aircraft that lays<font color="#CCCCCC"> in with a 55 pounds</font>

796
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,250
let me say this if you can afford an

797
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:06,379
aircraft that<font color="#E5E5E5"> weighs fifty five pounds I</font>

798
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:08,169
got lots of projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want you to fun</font>

799
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:11,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">for me</font>

800
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:13,570
because that's some serious money and

801
00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:14,979
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are those are your basic rules and</font>

802
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:16,899
even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go online and register</font>

803
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,999
aircraft the rule for that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

804
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:21,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">to register any aircraft you build or</font>

805
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:23,440
purchase that weighs over point five

806
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:25,570
five pounds it weighs over point five

807
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,179
five pounds you register it period<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

808
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:30,580
if you register<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you now get a little</font>

809
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:32,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">FAA card or less a registration number</font>

810
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,789
you stick it on your aircraft read the

811
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:36,789
rules they have lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of little rules to</font>

812
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:39,840
go with it it is now an FAA aircraft is

813
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:42,220
considered a register plane so in fact

814
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,779
Butler redneck guy decides to shoot your

815
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,210
aircraft out of it he just shot down a

816
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:47,919
registered FAA rare aircraft so now the

817
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:50,409
ball is on my side and things have

818
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,820
changed a little bit so in every story

819
00:29:50,409 --> 00:29:53,799
I've seen where they shot an aircraft

820
00:29:51,820 --> 00:30:14,470
down I don't know is even<font color="#CCCCCC"> registered yes</font>

821
00:29:53,799 --> 00:30:17,350
sir I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that I've seen</font>

822
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:20,409
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen</font>

823
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:22,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">because I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're a lot of those</font>

824
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:25,419
videos<font color="#CCCCCC"> were before all these legislation</font>

825
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:29,889
and all this lost into place so I think

826
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:31,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's part of it and if they too have a</font>

827
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:34,269
waiver to fly so you know and if they're

828
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:37,268
if they're a hobby you know even<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hobby</font>

829
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:39,789
fire and it's a place<font color="#CCCCCC"> where they legally</font>

830
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:41,830
can fly still not as you and like you

831
00:30:39,789 --> 00:30:44,320
said I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that any areas where</font>

832
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:45,549
those birds have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> harmed mostly it's</font>

833
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,668
those guys losing lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really</font>

834
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:50,408
expensive equipment so that's kind of

835
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:53,580
that but great question i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

836
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:56,769
that this will have an answer for it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

837
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:59,129
give me baby crazy that'll be one<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eagles</font>

839
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:42,730
technically yeah yeah you're still

840
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:52,330
required to maintain control of your

841
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:53,529
aircraft I mean it's just well that

842
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,480
brings me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next line I just</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have your waiver to prove the FAA</font>

861
00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:37,869
allowed me to film this event you've got

862
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:45,730
nothing to fall back on it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

863
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:52,600
legal stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's just they caught</font>

864
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:53,830
the house on fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well I know those</font>

865
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,509
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> hoverboards you know they were</font>

866
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:57,009
for a while they were like ministers but

867
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:58,899
you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but that</font>

868
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:00,460
brings us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a point that it's not in my</font>

00:32:58,899 --> 00:33:02,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide deck at all these lipo batteries</font>

870
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:04,299
are extremely flammable that's why they

871
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:06,820
can't take them on planes unless they're

872
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:08,340
inside of special bags which are line

873
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,960
with the blood of infants

874

stuff like that to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect the batteries</font>

875
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:15,360
and it's just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know all types of</font>

876
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:17,039
stuff like that so somewhat in<font color="#CCCCCC"> all so</font>

877
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,020
for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason you can't fly with your</font>

879
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:24,090
with you as checked baggage and you have

880
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,760
to show them everything's police stuff

881
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:33,330

882
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:34,650
protected so registration so we

883
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:36,120
mentioned that everything over half a

00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:40,770
while they were doing it for five bucks

887
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:42,149
I think it's 25 bucks now I may be wrong

888
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:44,010
maybe a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but it's</font>

889
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:45,209
you know you'll have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to register your</font>

typhoons or unique breezes things of

895
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:56,939
that nature select your aircraft give

896
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,260
them your money in and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're there</font>

897
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">there from that point on you have to</font>

898
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,919
have that number on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your aircraft you</font>

have to have your card with you anytime

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,760
you slot so that way if you are fly out

901
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,949
the lake and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a park ranger pulls on it</font>

902
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,989
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he says hey what you doing you can</font>

903
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:22,230
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> them your stuff and they'll leave</font>

904
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:26,868

<font color="#CCCCCC">know there's any direction as you can so</font>

906
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:31,859
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> brings me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know a thing</font>

907
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:33,750
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know of why</font>

908
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:35,009
we're here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also crashing I have the</font>

909
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:37,020
whole little spiel about crashing it's

910
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:39,570
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a slide deck but it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fun stuff</font>

911
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:42,540
flying restricted air play space fine

912
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:44,250
your aircraft near airports interfering

913
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,929
with rescue efforts we<font color="#E5E5E5"> tustin all those</font>

914
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,369
those are while we can't have the nice

915
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:49,740
things and that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are here with</font>

916
00:34:47,369 --> 00:34:52,080
all this legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> mumbo jumbo to begin with</font>

917
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:53,819
and it's funny how the talks now become

918
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,199
more legal than they are about actual

919
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,330
having fun with the aircraft but that

920
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,730
brings us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the part 1 of 7 and here's</font>

921
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:02,819
a couple of links you can just google it

922
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:04,980
though and they'll be there the first is

923

GoPro Hero 3 plus attached to the bottom

1006
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,510
which costs probably twice as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

home it goes towards a lake and it keeps

1020
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:05,250
going towards the lake and it goes over

1021
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,289
the lake and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I can't see it anymore</font>

1022
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:12,569
in somewhere in the lake in old hickory

1032
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:37,130
video of the one of the first flights of

1033
00:39:34,729 --> 00:39:40,009
this aircraft and actually the thing

1034
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:42,619
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the video is gorgeous here</font>

1035
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:47,660
we are on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ground here we'll ant</font>

1036
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:48,949
people it amazes me how many insects are

1037
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:52,689
still flying around that daggone thing

1038
00:39:48,949 --> 00:39:55,249
up in the air that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of kills me</font>

1039
00:39:52,689 --> 00:39:56,719
so we're flying and with checking<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1040
00:39:55,249 --> 00:39:58,669
out we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the beautiful</font>

1041
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:03,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">scenery of the lake I kind of take it up</font>

1042
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:06,589
and use some little panning shots for

1043
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:08,558
this a little bit you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes it</font>

1044
00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:12,319
takes a gorgeous video it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

1045
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:18,559
this is a 2k and shut this at 2k not for

1046
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:20,329
cave and she gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is this is my</font>

1047
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:24,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">neighborhood so I mean I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> robbed by the</font>

1048
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:26,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">lake and he's like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know show me</font>

1049
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:29,598
that come home thing so I did I'm a fast

1050
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:31,640
forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit so it's about this</font>

1051
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,499
time I hit the<font color="#CCCCCC"> button I France to see</font>

1052
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,390
the come home feature the home plate has

1053
00:40:33,499 --> 00:40:37,640
been set so when you take off for the DG

1054
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:40,879
I it'll say it will talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say home</font>

1055
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,140
point has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> set my suggestion if</font>

1056
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,309
you're using standards do that a few

1057
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:48,049
times because if you notice it's just it

1058
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:50,599
turns this way which is away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

1059
00:40:48,049 --> 00:40:53,329
that's the lake once again and it starts

1060
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:55,039
flying away and I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Carnegie</font>

1061
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:56,869
control of it here that's that jerky

1062
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:58,969
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like not I'm not having any of</font>

1063
00:40:56,869 --> 00:41:01,749
it so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just starts flying away at</font>

1064
00:40:58,969 --> 00:41:01,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">sandra's villa road</font>

1065
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:09,029
hey goodbye and it keeps flying and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1066
00:41:07,259 --> 00:41:11,009
if you see us<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a little road kind of</font>

1067
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:12,239
the little bridge there we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1068
00:41:11,009 --> 00:41:13,739
fast forward a little bit you'll see

1069
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:18,299
that bridge again in a second as it

1070
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:21,739
flies over it it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> going towards</font>

1071
00:41:18,299 --> 00:41:21,739
the bridge it's just flying backwards

1072
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:28,619
look look we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about that no</font>

1073
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:30,630
because the standards work over Wi-Fi

1074
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:32,279
signals for transferring the video I

1075
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:34,019
have zero control now there's that

1076
00:41:32,279 --> 00:41:36,150
little bridge we were talking about so

1077
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:39,868
it's crossing the road there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1078
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:45,450
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep on going I'm just sitting</font>

1079
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:46,739
there actually we're trying to locate

1080
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:48,149
which direction the minute we're all

1081
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:50,670
kind of hop in a car see if we can find

1082
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:51,630
it but it was gone and thing is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

1083
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:53,549
none of us we're looking this direction

1084
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:56,789
we thought it went this way but it's

1085
00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:58,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">really going this way so it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1086
00:41:56,789 --> 00:41:59,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep on flying it this is beautiful</font>

1098
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,618
at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have no idea where it's at have</font>

1099
00:42:28,499 --> 00:42:33,718
nothing just kind of keep keeps on

1100
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:35,819
flying it does this for you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1101
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:38,069
seven minutes of flan video now these

1102
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:43,979
batteries are good for about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

1103
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:45,180

1105
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:52,229
their own battery I should probably take

1106
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:53,759
care of that now as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video ends i</font>

1107
00:42:52,229 --> 00:42:55,890
will say that because it wasn't flying

1108
00:42:53,759 --> 00:42:57,420
it did have video but up battery to

1109
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:58,739
power the camera i did get about six

1110
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,920
hours of video<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it laying on the</font>

really should probably think about

1114
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:12,020
landing and this is really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

1115
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,240
thing about DGI they really i mean i

1116
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:15,920

service but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should look at this thing</font>

1121
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:27,830
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like gently coming down I'm</font>

1122
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:29,450
like this is beautiful and watch as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1123
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:30,950
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> down I see all these like trees</font>

1124
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:36,080
and stuff and I'm like it's missing

1125
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:38,419
every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> tree ranch look at this see</font>

1126
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:41,020
this is amazing look at that I've missed

1127
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:45,859
it every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single tree right this is also</font>

1128
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:50,450
every single yet but not so much very

1129
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:55,400
good good now like I said I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1130
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:57,830
six hours of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now this brings me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1131
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,060
my point here when you're flying these

1132
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:00,590
aircraft one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I deal with</font>

1133
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,090
every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> one that I fly like this</font>

1134
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:04,130
where I'm taking video or I have the

1135
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:07,130
potential to lose and it costs money on

1136
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:10,670
the micro SD card I put a file that says

1137
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:11,960
read me if found I don't care if she

1138
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:13,520
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> the aircraft it's probably in</font>

1139
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,490
pieces anyway but surely would like the

1140
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,839
video of how the heck this happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1141
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:21,290
where it went and everything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1142
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:22,940
anyway a while later a guy shows up at

1143
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:25,880
my door nine months later<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be exact</font>

1144
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,500
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'ma close my laptop I'm going to</font>

1145
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,740
slide to this point and not<font color="#CCCCCC"> miss later</font>

1146
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:32,210
he shows up he goes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you he just</font>

1147
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:34,520
leaves it he goes and that was pretty

1148
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:37,099
much it after we cleaned all the spiders

1149
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,650
bugs mud and crud out of it where it's

1150
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:42,859
been out rained on snowed on everything

1151
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:45,290
for nine months the battery was fried<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1152
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:47,359
put a new battery in cleaned it up put

1153
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:50,029
new rotors any props on it all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the type</font>

1154
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:52,190
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff took right off after i</font>

1155
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:53,720
recalibrated so my daughters like well

1156
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,900
you got three more phantoms can I have

1157
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:58,089
that would ensure

1158
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:01,960
so she got her own fan and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aston</font>

1159
00:44:58,089 --> 00:45:03,819
everybody phantom yeah but I uh that's

1160
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,579
kind of that scenario and she wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1161
00:45:03,819 --> 00:45:07,359
purple so it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> purple phantom but uh</font>

1162
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:08,859
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the funny thing is once again</font>

1163
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,450
because these guys control after the

1164
00:45:08,859 --> 00:45:11,770
second flight says I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will not take off</font>

1165
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:13,569
any more until you upgrade my firmware

1166
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:17,049
I'm nine<font color="#CCCCCC"> months out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of date on the</font>

1167
00:45:13,569 --> 00:45:18,279
firmware so too<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad I'm sir probably got</font>

1168
00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:21,160
two flights out of what happened that

1169
00:45:18,279 --> 00:45:23,410
unit was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IMU failed in my opinion so</font>

1170
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,700
has an internal magnetic unit they're

1171
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:26,828
very successful<font color="#CCCCCC"> two magnetic</font>

1172
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:29,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">interference cellphone towers etc sitter</font>

1173
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:31,900
Wi-Fi signals anything they got freaked

1174
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:34,598
out and just lost where it was added to

1175
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:36,130
god that's so the brand new phantom<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1176
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:38,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">advanced which was released this week</font>

1177
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:40,299
was when I got the email for it now has

1178
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:42,700
redundant<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS is and redundant I am use</font>

1179
00:45:40,299 --> 00:45:46,538
it so you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an aircraft with redundant</font>

1180
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:47,828
hardware for 1399 fantastic but<font color="#CCCCCC"> myself</font>

1181
00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:49,450
personally I'm leaning more towards the

1182
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:51,789
unique stuff I'm almost double my time

1183
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:53,230
the pie feel H in my opinion is probably

1184
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:55,569
if you have the money<font color="#E5E5E5"> the aircraft to</font>

1185
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:56,950
buy right now it is a hex rotor not only

1186
00:45:55,569 --> 00:45:58,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">does it have all the cool stuff that you</font>

1187
00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:01,029
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> find in a DJI phantom but it also</font>

1188
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:02,618
has a separate intel atom processor and

1189
00:46:01,029 --> 00:46:04,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">the light bridge technology that entails</font>

1190
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:05,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">redeveloping so if you have it play with</font>

1191
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:08,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">light bridge you can download it for</font>

1192
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:09,849
your webcam for your pc it's free it'll

1193
00:46:08,109 --> 00:46:11,980
do all your eye tracking face tracking

1194
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:13,809
all that kind of stuff will the library

1195
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:15,940
technology we're using it builds 3d maps

1196
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:17,890
and if you fly the location<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than</font>

1197
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,960
once it improves the map it remembers<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1198
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:21,609
improves the mat and to fly it you have

1199
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,549
a weave style controller you say take

1200
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:26,259
off up down whatever follow me you put

1201
00:46:24,549 --> 00:46:28,720
in your pocket<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it builds the map as</font>

1202
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:30,490
applies it's very intelligent it will

1203
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:34,000
not run into<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and it will follow</font>

1204
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:35,078
you and it's a fantastic aircraft<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 42</font>
