for cynic and get bugs we're kind of

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:17,730
combination of bug bounty program

5
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:19,080
vulnerability finding and we build tools

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,180
to help the bug bounty people try to

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,089
find vulnerabilities quicker do I still

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,990
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wear the mic on my ear it is oh</font>

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,698
cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so why did I give this talk</font>

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was chatting with I think tango down</font>

12
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:36,480
green track talks and I had some really

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,820
phenomenal mentors in my professional

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,010
career does anyone know jks on<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter</font>

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,660
no there's a lot of awesome phone

16
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,710
hacking he taught me how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like attack</font>

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">android devices let's see it look out at</font>

18
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,430
Tim and Caleb's Alton there's some of

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,430
the best android reversers<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think in</font>

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,260
the world you know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cory taught me</font>

21
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,090
reverse engineering at mitre and how I

22
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,070
was an intern I just like emailed them

23
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,410
randomly they weren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> state</font>

24
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,879
I was in I was like I'm a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dork and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

25
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,738
really like your stuff like will you<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,179
my best friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they actually wrote</font>

27
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,720
back and like it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of cool and</font>

28
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,670
then they taught me x86 Tom Maguire I

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,979
took his class at Hopkins and I actually

30
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,170
didn't meet any vias prereqs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

31
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,840
took it and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like buddies and I</font>

32
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,110
get free beer from his brewery and a

33
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,820
bunch of shy people at mitre and I say

34
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,830
this because I also had a lot of like

35
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,809
really crappy mentors and professors and

36
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,119
my professional<font color="#CCCCCC"> and academic careers and</font>

37
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,530
I find it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really sad when people are</font>

38
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,479
like fascinated about learning these

39
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,860
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of technical skill sets and then</font>

40
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,020
they get you know kind of disillusioned

41
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:41,400
either in a bad class so they had a bad

42
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:44,189
boss or mentor or something so so good

43
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,390
mentors talked about that and a good

44
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,889
mentor is always going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be supportive</font>

45
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,759
and like not be a jerk and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of help</font>

46
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,649
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn these things people to avoid</font>

47
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,890
avoid people aren't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer your</font>

48
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,000
questions or assume like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know</font>

49
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,259
what you're talking about because you're

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking the time out to ask them</font>

51
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,950
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who assume</font>

52

you're doing things<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong from the</font>

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">get-go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I used to teach karate to</font>

54
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,170
special needs kids and one of the things

55
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,209
I found really helpful I<font color="#E5E5E5"> broke things</font>

56
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,530
into people's learning styles so if

57
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:14,850
you're a visual learner but

58
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,620
me where I like reading a lot of books

59
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,290
throughout this talk i<font color="#CCCCCC"> will give you</font>

60
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,540
books slides and other resources to

61
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,359
supplement claims if your auditory

62
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,190
learner everywhere I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> find classes</font>

63
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,410
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube videos I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give you</font>

64
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,870
that too and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're kinesthetic where</font>

65
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,060
you learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> by doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give that good</font>

66
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,600
practical fun exercise it's going to

67
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,880
learn these skills so security

68
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,239
operations center we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk</font>

69
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,280
about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> practical OSI model things</font>

70
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:46,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">IDs systems and data sets and host</font>

71
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,500
analysis who's a student in the room out

72
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:55,320
of curiosity so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that about 5050</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

73
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:59,310
cool let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> see so highly recommend books</font>

74
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,160
here tcp/ip guide the tcp/ip illustrate

75
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,810
vol.1 this book's been around since like

76
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,450
1980-something huge it's like a phone

77
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,739
book but if your academic books you ever

78
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,018
want to dive in something that's really

79
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,170
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the author of the</font>

80
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:15,030
third one just spoke before me so a lot

81
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:19,470
of these exercises<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can learn very</font>

82
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:22,620
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of these books so who's seen</font>

83
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,090
the OSI model before awesome cool I

84
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,459
don't network background so I had to

85
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,019
learn this stuff so we run talk about

86
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:31,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun things at a few different layers</font>

87
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:35,670
who's done ARP spoofing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay actually</font>

88
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,920
only I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 so a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

89
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,540
here if you're a auditory learner<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

90
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,609
taught an eight hour class it's up on

91
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,370
youtube intro to flow analysis the first

92
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:46,260
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours we go through this OSI model I</font>

93
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:50,609
think really well so if you want any

94
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:53,399
more audio at talk about that check that

95
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:56,190
out another one is who's ever done

96
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,560
subnetting before yeah hard when you

97
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:01,739
first learned it yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay who sort of</font>

98
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">Peter packet no okay I actually gave us</font>

99
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:07,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bunch of undergrads</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco made a</font>

100
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,480
cartoon TV show designed to teach high

101
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,209
schoolers and entry level students

102
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,369
subnetting so Peter packet lands on his

103
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:16,680
planet that's not submitted properly and

104
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,870
you have to help them yeah that's true

105
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,280
um it's actually really really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

106
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,789
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need like walkthrough on some of</font>

107
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,530
those I found<font color="#CCCCCC"> it really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful so ARP</font>

108
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:27,250
spoofing is really cool and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a</font>

109
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,229
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people don't get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

110
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,970
so essentially when you layer to network

111
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">arps important because how it works is</font>

112
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,260
like my phone hops on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> life</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I hear it</font>

113
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,290
shouts out to your broadcast address hey

114
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:40,990
who's my you know router and then router

115
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:43,420
or the land the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gateway response ARP</font>

116
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,400
spoofing because art is stateless it's

117
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,250
basically whoever responded last or most

118
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,049
frequently that becomes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gateway so</font>

119
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,910
what you do is you essentially just span

120
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that subnet with you pretending and be</font>

121
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,480
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gateway of the router and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

122
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:58,390
can see everything which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty cool</font>

123
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,580
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say this because I do a lot of IOT</font>

124
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:02,200
attacking stuff and some of the things

125
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,669
what I find frustrating is I can't

126
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,950
configure the network on these devices

127
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:09,010
they kind of auto join so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font>

128
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,570
forcefully do art poisoning but then I

129
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,180
can see all the kind of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> going up</font>

130
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so who is like IOT in their house</font>

131
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,010
right now like a juicer or coffee maker

132
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,390
PlayStation yeah doolittle ARP spoofing

133
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,650
and see what kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of comes out there</font>

134
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:24,400
you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be kind of surprised how</font>

135
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:26,679
frequently things things so now we're

136
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,719
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about man in the middle who's</font>

137
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">done man in the middle in the room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

138
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,870
a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more people cool as any so</font>

139
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:36,940
for a very awesome setup for this as a

140
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,040
malware analysis cookbook chapter<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7</font>

141
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,330
talks about how you can configure like a

142
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,250
little man in the middle box with a

143
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,990
raspberry pi or any kind of old linux

144
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,900
server and this is cool because you

145
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:49,630
allow yourself to essentially go inspect

146
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,280
modify or block all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic right so</font>

147
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,380
if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see like what happens</font>

148
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,630
when I don't know my little<font color="#E5E5E5"> brothers</font>

149
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,860
playing<font color="#CCCCCC"> PlayStation and I pause this</font>

150
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,540
traffic when he's playing call of duty

151
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:02,919
you can kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of see how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those things</font>

152
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:05,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen right and then we're going to get</font>

153
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:08,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to our kind of higher layer 0 SI model</font>

154
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,609
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can do fun HTTP proxy stuff who's</font>

155
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,130
ever played with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a proxy looked at</font>

156
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,800
traffic before cool all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right some</font>

157
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:16,630
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> third this is really cool</font>

158
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,550
because when I was an<font color="#E5E5E5"> undergrad often</font>

159
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:21,280
they kind of gave me boring like let's

160
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:23,080
inspect CNN com or something web sampled

161
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,520
and I think now there's so many

162
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,820
interesting apps out there you can do

163
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,440
this a lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun on your phone you</font>

164
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,880
can do this pretty trivially you can

165
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,290
just go into settings and set up a

166
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,969
little proxy with men in the middle

167
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:37,810
proxy or burp and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give links how to</font>

168
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:39,940
do that so I had a co-worker my current

169
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,689
job his name's Nathan he also did the

170
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,929
grammar on these

171
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:44,889
slides if there's any mistakes blame him

172
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:46,808
Nathan was listening to a streaming

173
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:48,909
radio service he's like I hate these ads

174
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:51,219
and I was like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you can just</font>

175
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,539
like look in wireshark and TCP dump and

176
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:55,149
these kind of proxy tools and mess

177
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:56,438
around with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems like no so we</font>

178
00:06:55,149 --> 00:07:02,799
started to do that which was a lot of

179
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:04,179
fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know super easy</font>

180
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:06,638
setup a proxy all you're going to do is

181
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:09,628
Firefox Chrome or your phone kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of go</font>

182
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,789
to your network settings and just pop in

183
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:15,279
your IP address and the port super easy

184
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:17,050
and a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people get concerned if</font>

185
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,499
they see HTTPS they kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> freak out</font>

186
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,939
like an intersect stuff not the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

187
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:25,389
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just put a fraudulent cert on there</font>

188
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:27,279
and you can decrypt it now there are

189
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:28,899
ways around that but less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font>

190
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,058
percent of apps do it right so don't

191
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:33,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">worry about it serious yes it's really</font>

192
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:34,959
bad so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if you can see this</font>

193
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:36,969
yeah I can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that well</font>

194
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,679
basically I started looking all these

195
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:40,179
getting post request right and this is

196
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:42,339
man-in-the-middle proxy it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

197
00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:43,958
like burp but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom</font>

198
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:46,329
you're seeing a bunch of content that

199
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:48,610
kind of looks like audio files so just

200
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:49,869
by like i was<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this i think a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

201
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,550
nights<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so I'd to listen a lot of</font>

202
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:53,709
like Taylor Swift and other pop artists

203
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,969
and what you could see is you can start

204
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:58,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get a feel so you can kind of see</font>

205
00:07:54,969 --> 00:08:01,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">like Oh see that's multimedia thing as</font>

206
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:02,619
I'm seeing I'm loading skipping a lot on

207
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:04,239
iheartradio because I want ads to show

208
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:06,849
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> over and over and over and over again</font>

209
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:08,828
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you go through every getting post</font>

210
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:10,419
request you start to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

211
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:12,369
like these are the parameters this is

212
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:15,089
how they keep track of how long I

213
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:18,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">listened before I skipped how long until</font>

214
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:20,110
the number of you know free skips you're

215
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:22,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">allowed so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see that start</font>

216
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:25,089
incrementing which is really really cool

217
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:27,369
so the other things I noticed<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it'll</font>

218
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:29,979
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of active streams days or</font>

219
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:32,319
you're currently allowed to skip so many

220
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:33,818
times a day and number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of skips</font>

221
00:08:32,318 --> 00:08:35,620
remaining so one of the things my

222
00:08:33,818 --> 00:08:36,909
friends and my mentee started doing was

223
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,409
he started messing with these values

224
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,179
right like oh how do I get a free

225
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:41,769
account how do i modify these kind of

226
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:45,670
things and he started learning a lot

227
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:47,110
just you know looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we also</font>

228
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,479
mentioned you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can learn how the api's</font>

229
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,370
work right so you then wrote his own

230
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,980
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> filter because he would see every</font>

231
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,959
AWS URL come through and

232
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,399
the ad ones at a very blinking different

233
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:01,359
domain scheme and you could just

234
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:02,860
blacklist all those wouldn't load so

235
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,019
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're that's a fun</font>

236
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,149
example right so go find a service<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

237
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:08,709
like or your kids like your sibling and

238
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:13,600
play around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it right you learn a</font>

239
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:15,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot we mentioned HTTPS traffic so story</font>

240
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,470
time on floor I what can't use this app

241
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,760
but my company did write<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

242
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys heard of the application i think</font>

243
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,860
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called hi there now it's basically</font>

244
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,290
tinder for marijuana enthusiasts and oh

245
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,670
yeah it's that so they didn't fix all

246
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,649
these bugs that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can talk about</font>

247
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,079
it so what it was the ideas you would

248
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:34,269
find people who enjoy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that activity and</font>

249
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:36,579
you would swipe but they kind of

250
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:39,220
implement it really bad first off all

251
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:41,859
the traffic was over HTTP which is bad

252
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:45,130
because in some states that's illegal

253
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,320
too well illegal in terms that activity

254
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,000
everyone enjoys on that app and the

255
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,500
other problem they had was I would swipe

256
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,269
and then what they would do is they

257
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,680
would send your GPS coordinates up to

258
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:57,519
their server and then it would send a

259
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,050
big JSON file everyone around<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to the</font>

260
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,970
phone and then it would randomly go

261
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:04,359
through and pick one<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a problem</font>

262
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:06,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a few reasons one even if that</font>

263
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">person didn't pick me I could know about</font>

264
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:12,459
60 or 70 people in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> geographic radius</font>

265
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:15,459
which is that and two I can they'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> never</font>

266
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:17,649
validated if your GPS position changed a

267
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:19,388
lot so through the API you could just

268
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:21,069
repeatedly hammer different zip codes

269
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:22,930
and different<font color="#CCCCCC"> illogical and food</font>

270
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:26,290
coordinates and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> see everyone in</font>

271
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:29,769
a huge geographic area so is that but

272
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:33,099
they have fixed fees which is good so I

273
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:35,410
des<font color="#E5E5E5"> systèmes who's played with an IDs</font>

275
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wish I did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this sooner in my career</font>

276
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,680

277
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,510

278
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,269
from richard bhella tech I think he's at

279
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:48,519
mandiant or fire I now the one on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit but still really really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

282
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,089
network security monitoring is

283
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,829
phenomenal every time before I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done a</font>

defensive for a more of a managerial or

288
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:07,269
structured process Carson Zimmerman

289
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,900
wasn't Meyer I think he's at Microsoft

290
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:10,060
now

291
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:13,750
it's a free book online phenomenal

292
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,989
write-ups in there so audio learners

293
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,370
there's tons a great content on this

294
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">b-sides talks have this intro to flow</font>

295
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">analysis we talked for an hour on how to</font>

296
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,030
basically how do you find bad guys on

297
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,280
large area networks and we assume no

298
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,870
prereqs which is pretty cool intro to

299
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,670
burrow is phenomenal it's one of my

300
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,800
favorite intrusion detection system it's

301
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:35,439
much better<font color="#E5E5E5"> now than it was seven years</font>

302
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,030
ago and Liam Randall's training is

303
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,830
really really good too he does a lot of

304
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:42,610
b-sides training so if you ever get a

305
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:44,470
chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> I highly recommend you take it so</font>

306
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:48,400
public data sets who's looked at a big

307
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:51,160
attack data set before no it's fun check

308
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,260
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there's tons of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them out on the</font>

309
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet like the DEFCON CTF you can go</font>

310
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:58,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and just look what that looks</font>

311
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,420
like right a lot of your department

312
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">defense and military colleges</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> release</font>

313
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,880
free data sets online because they

314
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:08,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">belittle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hacking team competitions and</font>

315
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,790
what I like about those is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ones</font>

316
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,740
we just was a flow classes we kind of

317
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,819
went through these very basic attacks

318
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,850
and got more and more and more

319
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:18,760
complicated so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what a basic nmap</font>

320
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,530
scan looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like with flow data and</font>

321
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,220
what's interesting here is once you

322
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:25,810
understand flow data it's kind of like a

323
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,250
telephone bill for network so you can't

324
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,869
you can't see what scent but you

325
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,890
understand who's talking to who your

326
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:35,320
source<font color="#CCCCCC"> ports your destination ports IP</font>

327
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,670
addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long that was</font>

328
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,620
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of bytes and number of packets</font>

329
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:41,439
and what's cool is you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

330
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,510
quickly figure out recon behavior right

331
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,070
and then from there<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we did is we</font>

332
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:47,710
walk through students like what's an

333
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:50,920
easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> trojan port will say this talks in</font>

334
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:52,090
port 1 2 3 4<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 and what you can do then</font>

335
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,250
you can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling this like</font>

336
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,200
attacking narrative you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I saw a</font>

337
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,150
bunch of really noisy scanning behavior

338
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,010
here's what it looks like and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw</font>

339
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,230
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojan behavior let's figure out</font>

340
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:04,300
happens next<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and then you can say</font>

341
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this box we know this box is popped</font>

342
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,930
what else is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to and it's</font>

343
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,819
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to do these flow tools and</font>

344
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,920
intrusion detection tools and because

345
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,110
these public data sets are free

346
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,640
availability online you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do this in</font>

347
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:20,590
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> home if you want so fun exercises</font>

348
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,730
alone learn these skills any of the

349
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:24,339
public data talks

350
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,290
great arm and just kind of start

351
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:27,430
basically okay if I'm a bad guy at the

352
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">scanner</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network what would that look</font>

353
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:33,430
like right what's unusual about that can

354
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> identify lateral movements which is</font>

355
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:37,019
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> move from one victim machine to</font>

356
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,490
another right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you pop a</font>

357
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:42,010
laptop for example then you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to</font>

358
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:45,610
a domain server right how would that

359
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:47,110
look a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these IDs systems can</font>

360
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,670
actually extract files out which is

361
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool because then you can put</font>

362
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,920
those in VMs and understand how they

363
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:55,420
work what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they look like I'm disk</font>

364
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,420
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> good thing anyone's students in</font>

365
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,979
here or even industry professor

366
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,139
professionals I highly recommend the

367
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:05,380
CCDC hacking conferences has anyone been

368
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:07,029
to those no<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whew this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

369
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool so essentially the premises what</font>

370
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,810
they do is they take students they give

371
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:13,240
them a fully<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simulated enterprise</font>

372
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:16,420
network so domain controller web server

373
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,190
a database bunch of clients and their

374
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">compromised from the get-go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

375
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,880
they have professional hackers break in

376
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:23,709
and what the cool thing is they keep

377
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,410
having them extend these networks which

378
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:28,300
making it weaker and weaker and even as

379
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,069
an adult or a non-student you can go in

380
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,930
there and pay to watch these kids freak

381
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,219
out over an eight hour period because

382
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,130
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get their butts handed to them like</font>

383
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,300
all day it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really good for recruiting</font>

384
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,579
no it's true you can see them when they

385
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,229
really freaked out and stuff right and

386
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:42,910
it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> really interesting to see like</font>

387
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,110
the red team will try to do things to

388
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,670
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and more apparent like</font>

389
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,680
they'll purposely crash there rats

390
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,529
another attack tool hoping that the

391
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,479
students<font color="#E5E5E5"> will pick up on it so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

392
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:55,510
about those two and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then host analysis</font>

393
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,370
stuff these three books are phenomenal

394
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,560
the red<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones saved me in grad school a</font>

395
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,720
lot I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it's more aimed for</font>

396
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,459
static reversing but they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

397
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,290
great chapters that basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

398
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:07,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay how would you monitor certain</font>

399
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:10,630
things on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows machine how do you</font>

400
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,800
look at registry creates he's created

401
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,800
how do you look at methods of

402
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,680
persistence and now you're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

403
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,930
more memory now we're in production

404
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:24,099
environments so art of memory forensics

405
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:26,709
is a really good book too so for classes

406
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,870
one of my co-workers<font color="#CCCCCC"> veronica cove todd</font>

407
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:31,149
a i think a two-day class in malware

408
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,550
dynamic<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis so you don't have to do</font>

409
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:35,470
reversing it's just here's a machine how

410
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,819
do you quickly figure out what happened

411
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,350
so you learn how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use these tools</font>

412
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">where essentially takes like a registry</font>

413
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,510
snapshot before and after you learn how

414
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,700
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to see how process trees kind of</font>

415
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,500
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> over time you learn all the ways</font>

416
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:51,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can hide on a windows box it's</font>

417
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:53,860
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good so resources Microsoft</font>

418
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,480
actually has free limited use of<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMs and</font>

419
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,150
not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know about they're</font>

420
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,190
designed for web developers to test your

421
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,720
app in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the various web browsers well you</font>

422
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,640
can do anything with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them they work for</font>

423
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,710
up 30 or 90 days so if you're looking

424
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:14,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">for free like little windows vm for</font>

425
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:15,880
malware stuff go pull these now so fun

426
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:18,040
exercise is that red book i mentioned

427
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,270
really good check it out they<font color="#E5E5E5"> said have</font>

428
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,949
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> really fun malware where</font>

429
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,240
essentially you start to run it and it

430
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,740
will do little check so you have to

431
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,990
learn to brake parts of it for to

432
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,580
continue execution and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nice thing</font>

433
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:30,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that book is they have like little</font>

434
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:34,870
short answers and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> very long verbose</font>

435
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:38,890
walkthroughs to have all the tools so

436
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:39,970
reverse engineering so<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prereqs if you</font>

437
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,310
want who knows what reversing is

438
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,990
actually first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually only</font>

439
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,699
half I think it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool it's what</font>

440
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,350
I do for a job<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when you take apart</font>

441
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,330
others<font color="#CCCCCC"> people's apps that they either</font>

442
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,760
don't want you to or you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack</font>

443
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:53,050
it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's malware it's really really</font>

444
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,500
fun because you get to understand all

445
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:58,359
the innards of os's it opens up tons of

446
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,950
job opportunities you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do like</font>

447
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,250
reverse engineering or malware you could

448
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,600
write on exploits a lot of opportunities

449
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,130
and to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this he actually really only</font>

450
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:08,530
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to prereqs depending on what</font>

451
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,930
language you're doing it in who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a</font>

452
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">java class in the room few people yeah</font>

453
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Java you can start reversing</font>

454
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:18,300
android apps right after this talk

455
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:20,950
serious and if you know who's done c

456
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,990
plus okay actually that's good turnout

457
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,400
if you know see you can top watch the

458
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,359
courses i'm going to recommend after

459
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,590
this to understand how<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stack works</font>

460
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:33,310
so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basic</font>

461
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:34,750
android reversing skills super easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

462
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,159
get these apps all you're going to do is

463
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,630
there something on github called the

464
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,730
google play<font color="#E5E5E5"> api and it basically</font>

465
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,530
pretends to be a phone so you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

466
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:43,450
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> google play grab your apps and suck</font>

467
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:46,420
them down and then there's these two

468
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:48,790
free tools that allow you to start

469
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,360
taking that apart the first one do you

470
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,280
see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> local</font>

471
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,620
background yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you can</font>

472
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,080
make out the text but that is basically

473
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">a tool called JD GUI and you're going to</font>

474
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,120
use something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called Dexta jar to make</font>

475
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:03,280
that more easily readable and the black

476
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,889
tool is something called apktool which

477
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,480
is the disassembly so I like to equate

478
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,490
this essentially like English and then

479
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,110
like Shakespeare in English so the

480
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:14,080
disassembly it's your kind of ground

481
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:15,879
truth it'll you always can view it I

482
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,840
think you get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most out of it and</font>

483
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">your decompile is a little less verbose</font>

484
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,000
but easier to read it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like source</font>

485
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:26,889
code and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give you a little</font>

486
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,410
android 101 so you understand some of

487
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:32,140
these things here anyone are in an

488
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:34,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android app in the room no ok this is</font>

489
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:36,669
fine everything you'll need not to read

490
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:40,270
any Google documentation after this an

491
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:42,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">APK is just a zip file first is you have</font>

492
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,750
a manifest that's your<font color="#CCCCCC"> high level info</font>

493
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,790
it's like a table of<font color="#CCCCCC"> contents basically</font>

494
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,850
what the permissions are what the app

495
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:51,700
can do so you have to worry about

496
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:53,139
meta-inf<font color="#E5E5E5"> is signer information Google</font>

497
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,480
actually works it's like public/private

498
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,600
key so I sign a nap you can check it

499
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,679
what's up google play updates work

500
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,689
classes<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot Dex is you're actually</font>

501
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,370
compiled machine codes remember for me

502
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,049
like your entry level CS classes you

503
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,909
write your source code gets compiled

504
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:08,770
usually in some kind of object code or

505
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:11,650
your assembly right and then from<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

506
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:14,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">it just translated to your binary or</font>

507
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,570
zeros and ones the classes Dex is yours

508
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,428
your own ones that's what those free

509
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:21,549
tools i mentioned do they convert that

510
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:23,470
but something<font color="#E5E5E5"> more readable then you</font>

511
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:25,270
have your lid so in android you actually

512
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,309
can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> c code you'll see this in video</font>

513
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:29,168
game some malware and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

514
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:31,928
tools but we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to touch any</font>

515
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:33,760
of that today and lastly you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

516
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:35,350
assets and resources which is like

517
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,179
pictures<font color="#CCCCCC"> and images and other things</font>

518
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:42,189
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so basic structure an activity</font>

519
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,630
if you can touch it it's an activity

520
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,510
like if you touch a button something

521
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:48,730
happens activity services run in the

522
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:51,370
background so if you're doing a music

523
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:53,200
service right if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm on facebook i can</font>

524
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:56,409
also be<font color="#E5E5E5"> listening to spotify at the same</font>

525
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,530
time right that's a service receivers

526
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:01,450
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of input right so who's</font>

527
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:03,129
noticed on netflix where if you're if

528
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,300
you go off Wi-Fi like pops up

529
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,550
like hey you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use all your</font>

530
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:09,820
data plan right that's an idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

531
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:11,830
receiver so it can look for changes in

532
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,740
phone behavior so a change in connection

533
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,960
an incoming text message all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those kind</font>

534
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,550
of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and lastly you have content</font>

535
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,470
providers which is one way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sharing</font>

536
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,629
data in between apps it's just a

537
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:27,810
slightly convoluted like sequel like

538
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:30,760
language so we talked about the manifest

539
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:32,169
skip this here permissions right so

540
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,960
androids me because you have bunch of

541
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,310
permissions here right example you can

542
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,110
play around with what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of location</font>

543
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:40,030
data if you want like so<font color="#E5E5E5"> like coarse</font>

544
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:42,189
location uses more of your battery

545
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:46,120
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a ping the GPS more</font>

546
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:48,520
than the the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds right if it can</font>

547
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:52,060
receive SMS or parse your SMS you'll see

548
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,080
these kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of permissions in there the</font>

549
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,490
next thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how do you find the</font>

550
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,409
starting point in a nap and a lot of

551
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:58,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">people get super intimidated by this but</font>

552
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:00,730
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually not that bad all it is is</font>

553
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,760
an XML file and you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

554
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:05,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">look for the tag application and then</font>

555
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,990
you look for activity and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll have a</font>

556
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:09,760
name there and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android intent that</font>

557
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:11,260
actually not<font color="#CCCCCC"> main all that means is when</font>

558
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,360
you push the little shortcut for a nap

559
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:18,250
that's what pops up first it's all you

560
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:20,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">got no so this is Somali time who's a</font>

561
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,460
fan of read it in the room few people

562
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:25,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right you guys member the Carter</font>

563
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:27,550
thing on reddit one guy so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

564
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:30,730
teach you five<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes the basics of</font>

565
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:32,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">Android reversing language end and it</font>

566
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,630
can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit dry so every time</font>

567
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,760
you learn a new concept I put a photo of

568
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,530
Carter and the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Carter was he's a</font>

569
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,720
random kid he knocked on his neighbor's

570
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,399
door who never met this kid before said

571
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,980
can I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a banana and then just ate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

572
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a whole subreddit popped up of like</font>

573
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:50,950
funny photo shops and I say why you have

574
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,570
to learn this because a lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font>

575
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,730
tools people like me and others we know

576
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,919
how to break those so when you reverse a

577
00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:00,850
nap you might not always have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

578
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:02,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">Java like source code view or you can</font>

579
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,389
buy jab which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually really nice</font>

580
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,580
it's about one hundred twenty dollars a

581
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,550
month and you can actually see source

582
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,570
code on one side<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the</font>

583
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:13,030
disassembly on the other so it's really

584
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:16,290
nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> for learning but you do have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay</font>

585
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:18,720
if you I think they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a 30 day trial</font>

586
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:20,550
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned apktool there's a nice</font>

587
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,380
sublime<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in and there's also vim</font>

588
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:27,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">plugin if you want to see pretty syntax</font>

591
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,110
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be scary all for you</font>

592
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:36,450
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cover how classes look</font>

593
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:40,649
fields method parameters and other

594
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:42,300
things so first things first class is

595
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:45,390
purple and then you're going to have a

596
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,399
file<font color="#CCCCCC"> named super easy and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Java right you</font>

597
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:51,030
have those four things public-private

598
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:53,280
protected and package that's it so class

599
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:55,680
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> keyword all right and then the type</font>

600
00:22:53,280 --> 00:23:01,080
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> java and then the name of it so this</font>

601
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:04,050
one's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> main activity super means</font>

602
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,960
you inherit from another object right so

603
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:08,370
in this case it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Herring inheriting</font>

604
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,870
from activity<font color="#E5E5E5"> which makes sense because</font>

605
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:14,360
it's like activity and then you have all

606
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:14,360
your custom activities right super easy

607
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:19,980
source is the name of this is neat

608
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,390
because an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android when you build an app</font>

609
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,310
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little checkbox that says try</font>

610
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:25,830
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> office Kate my code what that means</font>

611
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:28,470
is main activity becomes like a dot

612
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:31,020
whatever and a dot whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll have</font>

613
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:33,690
methods like<font color="#E5E5E5"> B dot whatever and it could</font>

614
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:36,480
have attributes like<font color="#CCCCCC"> C dot whatever so</font>

615
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,250
some older versions they didn't take out

616
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,840
the source name so what's fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font>

617
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,620
reversing perspective is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

618
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,540
like ABCDE etc I'll go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and i'll</font>

619
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,489
say source like super secret encryption

620
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:52,830
routine it shouldn't be public right and

621
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:55,140
that's that's where this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is useful ok</font>

622
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:59,189
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hardest part here variables</font>

623
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:03,750
are pretty easy how it works is you have

624
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:06,690
v4 void be four bytes<font color="#E5E5E5"> s4 shorts c4</font>

625
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:09,090
char's eyes for integers JS furlongs

626
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:11,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">effort floats and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these are doubles and</font>

627
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:14,159
l4 object<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't remember this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font>

00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">look it up when I need to so I don't few</font>

629
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,970
guys can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things here but</font>

630
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically you have some EU dl whatever</font>

631
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:25,230
colon that means it's a integer right

632
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:28,050
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one this IE OD CSD whatever</font>

633
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:31,220
L means that some object and i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

634
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,220
about what shared preferences are

635
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:37,529
this is the hardest part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

636
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,990
by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way then you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a raised arrays</font>

637
00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:42,539
just means a bracket right so this one

638
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:45,570
is a char array right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's just</font>

639
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:49,379
bracket and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> C for char and you can</font>

640
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:51,539
also the other one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a L which means</font>

641
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:56,190
object for a string and you see what

642
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:58,200
kind of object after it so what does a

643
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:00,690
method look like so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts with the</font>

644
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,690
keyword method and ends with n methods

645
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:05,159
it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sandwich right</font>

646
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,919
you're going to have type remember those

647
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,260
for java ones we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

648
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:12,659
public-private protected and<font color="#CCCCCC"> packaged</font>

649
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:14,908
and next<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the name of it so in</font>

650
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:16,529
this case called on create which is what

651
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:18,750
happens when you first click an activity

652
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:20,940
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android and then you have your</font>

653
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:23,370
parameters so this one it takes a bundle

654
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:26,880
object so<font color="#CCCCCC"> L and then the name of the</font>

655
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:31,320
object<font color="#E5E5E5"> and lastly what it returns and</font>

656
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:34,830
this one means<font color="#CCCCCC"> be for void then you have</font>

657
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,289
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of local variables in there the</font>

658
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:38,760
parameter so in this one it's called

659
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:40,139
saved instance state and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes</font>

660
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,669
sense because a bundle is essentially

661
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:47,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">like the context of the state of the</font>

662
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:48,600
application when it starts and let's see

663
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:51,720
function parameter see<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a little</font>

664
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:54,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit more complex example so this method</font>

665
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:58,019
is called an it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> azeem</font>

666
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:59,760
for a boolean and then a string and then

667
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:01,200
an it and I did this one because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

668
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,870
looks really really weird when all these

669
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,630
things are put together because only the

670
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:08,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">L or the objects have it little summary</font>

671
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,899
colon separating them so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

672
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,418
reverse you might see something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

673
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:15,149
takes like gosh what's a good example

674
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:20,070
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I ID for like a bunch of integers</font>

675
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:22,139
and then a double<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so hardest part</font>

676
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:24,330
of this so in a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes ago some</font>

677
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:25,469
really fun capture the flag exercises

678
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:28,230
and we're going to break some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top</font>

679
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:34,220
password apps live and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk</font>

680
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:34,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that too sure shoot yes</font>

681
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:40,640
yeah beautiful<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can do so the</font>

682
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,860
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> was who does Jeb just take</font>

683
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,420
those rules and make it java yeah so

684
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,129
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java like so it's the best</font>

685
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,510
interpretation of it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes you'll</font>

686
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,640
end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with like slightly different</font>

687
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:51,410
loops structure like instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

688
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,230
for loop it'll be a while loop<font color="#CCCCCC"> with like</font>

689
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:56,360
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> try-catch but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you can start</font>

690
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:59,150
with Dexta jar and JD<font color="#E5E5E5"> GUI and i'll show</font>

691
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:02,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">you this live in a few minutes and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

692
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:03,620
would try the trial for<font color="#E5E5E5"> jib</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too yeah</font>

693
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,209
it's really good for learnings you can

694
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,100
do side-by-side and you can actually

695
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,810
highlight where you are in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java with</font>

696
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,550
the assembly so you can figure out how

697
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:15,610
one line of Java is like five lines of

698
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:17,480
assembly which is really cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 4°c</font>

699
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:19,909
x86 so if you ever want to write

700
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,680
exploits and be a cool hacker person or

701
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,450
take apart malware or shadow broker

702
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,460
dumps this is stuff you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need</font>

703
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:27,680
practical malware analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my</font>

704
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:30,430
opinion by far the best book there they

705
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,780
walk this through very very nice

706
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:34,490
practical reversing is actually kind of

707
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,230
decent for an<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm there's not many good</font>

708
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:39,620
arm reversing books which is how like

709
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:43,720
the mobile apps work and lastly for

710
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:45,800
32-bit x86 is this one on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> side here</font>

711
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:50,690
so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ever wrote a book I probably</font>

712
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:52,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">once but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my face uncover but yeah the</font>

713
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,260
other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Intel an arm have these</font>

714
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:56,960
huge instruction<font color="#E5E5E5"> manuals it's like for</font>

715
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,490
phone books they're free online and if

716
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,870
you find<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mistake in them they usually</font>

717
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:05,090
send you free paper copies so yeah so

718
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:08,179
audio learners tons of content here

719
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:09,620
intro to x86 is what i learned i cried

720
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,360
the first time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i took it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but then i</font>

721
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:13,939
taught it a few years later so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

722
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,189
learn these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's about two days</font>

723
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,840
of content intro diverse engineering

724
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,670
teaches you how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a tool called I'd</font>

725
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,929
approach which is kind of the de facto

726
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:24,920
standard then we do reverse to a

727
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:26,120
reversing malware one which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

728
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,770
neat where they walk through<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font>

729
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,810
samples from the practical book<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

730
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:32,600
mentioned and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> common ones and</font>

731
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:35,169
enterprises today an intro to arm is

732
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:38,149
another one too<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should also say</font>

733
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:39,650
Mallory unicorn on Twitter she just

734
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,690
released a really good training content

735
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:44,340
to and

736
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:47,770
after the talk will link<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that as well</font>

737
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:49,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">so when you start learning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reversing who</font>

738
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:51,820
did a data structures class back in the

739
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:55,120
day remember the stack that yeah so the

740
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:56,889
stack is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how uncie code how all your</font>

741
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,320
kind of local variables work so you have

742
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:01,030
to understand how your<font color="#E5E5E5"> c code and the</font>

743
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,310
assembly interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stack and</font>

744
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,480
how all these talks and the lectures<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

745
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:06,340
linked to they basically start one

746
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,530
instruction at a time so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> send about</font>

747
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,870
10 to 20<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes on how does pop work</font>

748
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:13,450
how does return work how does call work

749
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:15,040
with basic hello world and then it gets

750
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:16,720
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more complicated like okay</font>

751
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,690
how do you add two values how do you

752
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,360
subtract two values then they start

753
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:24,010
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how parameters work the</font>

754
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,560
time of data storage how like an integer

755
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:28,060
and array would look differently then

756
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:31,210
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about loops conditional</font>

757
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:33,850
statements<font color="#CCCCCC"> too and there's a who's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard</font>

758
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:35,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the carnegie mellon bomb lab no it's</font>

759
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,270
coolest lab I ever heard of so

760
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,800
apparently when it was taught at

761
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:41,110
Carnegie Mellon the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that a</font>

762
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:44,080
professor gives you a binary bomb to

763
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:46,629
defuse and there's six phrases or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Keys</font>

764
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,949
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to put in to defuse it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and every</font>

765
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:49,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">time you did one and wrong it would like</font>

766
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:52,120
to ducked off your final grade which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

767
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:56,230
kind of cool and essentially this is

768
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:59,229
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice because each step of the</font>

769
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:01,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">bomb defusal teaches you a reinforces</font>

770
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,100
part of the rehearse engineering skills

771
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:06,070
the first one is like you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a</font>

772
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,480
phrase and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is like you go</font>

773
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">through a loop and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to calculate</font>

774
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:14,050
some values every<font color="#E5E5E5"> step in the loop right</font>

775
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:15,550
so it builds very nicely<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right bug</font>

776
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:18,340
bounty stuff here's kind of my bread and

777
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:19,360
butter here I'm a lot of mobile bug

778
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,669
bounties<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about some</font>

779
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">fun skills and fun proof of concepts and</font>

780
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:26,050
practical examples and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk</font>

781
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:30,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">about some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web stuff too so to the best</font>

782
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:32,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">books out here is mobile application</font>

783
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,930
hacker's handbook and the iOS

784
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:38,430
application security book I cannot

785
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:38,430
highlight these more they're phenomenal

786
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:43,750
oocysts really good who's heard of OAuth

787
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:47,139
spin the room a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people cool so</font>

788
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:49,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's basically recommended web defenses</font>

789
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,190
and common web attacks now they<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

790
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:54,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing mobile ones and they have samples</font>

791
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:56,710
and code and I have contributed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

792
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:59,890
my friend and mentor<font color="#CCCCCC"> j case has a blog</font>

793
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:02,530
called BBQ & 0 days that he gives great

794
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:05,260
barbecue recipes and he rips apart

795
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:08,310
really poorly designed popular apps in a

796
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:10,360
funny manner the other good one is this

797
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:12,010
phenomenal talk called seven ways to

798
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,469
hang yourself at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google Android there's</font>

799
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:17,950
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DEFCON it's slightly dated but still</font>

800
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:19,690
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good for the foundations and I</font>

801
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:23,350
have the video<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk there and give my</font>

802
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:27,040
audio lecture so fun app reversing time

803
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:29,620
here these are the top two password or

804
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:31,180
picture storage apps in Google Play my

805
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,500
friend Jay case found these I'm just

806
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,270
going through these live with you guys

807
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:37,480
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see how poorly they</font>

808
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:39,970
implement this stuff so again how do you

809
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,310
download<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use the Google Play API and</font>

810
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:44,350
github makes it really easy if you have

811
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:46,480
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> on non rooted phone you can enable</font>

812
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:50,980
something called a DB hook it up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

813
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,420
dump them that way too so Jeb you just

814
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,670
open it in there make it super easy to

815
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:58,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">read if you want to use the free tool so</font>

816
00:31:54,670 --> 00:32:01,630
you unzip it and then open it up in the

817
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:03,580
Dexta jar and then use that open and JD

818
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:06,190
Dewey or if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want hard mode you can</font>

819
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,689
do with apktool and vim and sublime and

820
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,140
those little cart or reddit<font color="#CCCCCC"> photo shops</font>

821
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,140
will help you

822
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:18,889
hello folks I'm geekier unfortunately we

823
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,480
are having technical difficulties

824
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,610
throughout this talk and a third<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

825
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,400
my new<font color="#E5E5E5"> cancer device decided to wreak</font>

826
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:28,060
out and just not record any audio sorry

827
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,060
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inconvenience</font>

828
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:36,959
you
