tree I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk with you all</font>

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:36,170
about the you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> springtime for code</font>

7
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:38,940
reviews for the next 40 50 minutes or so

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">before we get going of course i'd like</font>

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,769
to thank besides Nash they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a</font>

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,930
good job of organizing I had the

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,760
privilege of helping organize this year

12
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,519
and that was you know just a privilege

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,989
to work with a lot of neat people and

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,910
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I came in they said would you</font>

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:58,680
give this bag away to somebody that's

16
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:08,390
you know is deserving of a bag uh yeah

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:08,390
you get it you look most eager enjoy

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:21,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so a little bit about a disclaimer</font>

19
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,909
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will be talking about some</font>

20
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,520
processes within your organization's of

21
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:30,120
what to do what not to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I've seen</font>

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,039
work what doesn't work if you happen to

23
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">commit any you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know career altering</font>

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:39,630
maneuvers or resume generating the vents

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,909
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem a couple of trigger</font>

26
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,990
warnings we will be talking about DevOps

27
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:50,250
and software developers that bothers you

28
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:53,190
there's the door it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about</font>

29
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,500
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm currently a consultant at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> defense</font>

point security a lot of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> classes</font>

31
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:03,330
happened to show up today and let's see

32
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,090
so I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security architect I'm</font>

33
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,500
recovering sis oh that's a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> nother</font>

34
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,598
experience and probably worth another

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,480
talk in its own right and well I've done

36
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:15,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">a wee bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of coding over the years I</font>

37
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,670
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to travel you know see Cadillacs</font>

38
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,810
buried in the ground in Texas just got

39
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,570
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> from New Zealand which is</font>

40
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely fantastic</font>

41
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:28,799
and I enjoy leaning as I go around

42
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:30,989
curves excuse me so a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font>

43
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,420
agenda first we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you a</font>

44
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:36,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of a story about you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know my</font>

45
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,459
first experience with code reviews talk

46
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,380
about findings and findings management

47
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,880
and what findings<font color="#E5E5E5"> me versus</font>

48
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,220
vulnerabilities at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> from my</font>

49
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,920
perspective and then about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

50
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,470
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get those fixed and you know</font>

51
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:56,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">working with PM's and developers and</font>

52
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:59,670
whatnot<font color="#CCCCCC"> so um when I moved here I got a</font>

53
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,160
phone call about four months<font color="#E5E5E5"> into moving</font>

54
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,970
to Tennessee I've had four year four

55
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,820
month old mortgage and I was just like

56
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:12,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay my boss is calling and saying hey</font>

57
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:15,660
Ryan are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Java architect just like</font>

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,550
I know Java and I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of architect what</font>

59
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,770
do you need he goes well<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a</font>

60
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,260
Washington Post incident can you come

61
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:25,410
and you know take a look at stuff with

62
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:28,049
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> program and deconstruct it you know</font>

63
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,660
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with our architects that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are maybe</font>

64
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,070
just not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as bright as you and figure out</font>

65
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,440
you know what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on are they doing</font>

66
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,959
the right thing to fix like sure it was

67
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:40,320
like okay get on the nair playing your

68
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:46,230
tip tickets are built be at the airport

69
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:48,299
at one-thirty<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you get to DC they</font>

70
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,880
give me you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the code base the</font>

71
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:54,120
architects the dbas and say figure it

72
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,959
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that I spent you know basically</font>

73
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">two hours three hours working through</font>

74
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,250
you know they're very simple let's fix

75
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,110
the point solution and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

76
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,030
like okay we understand that you know

77
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,220
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now would you do a review of</font>

78
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:12,709
everything else I'm just like fantastic

79
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:16,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">so this is a bit of how that went down</font>

80
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:18,149
so first what was the code review well

81
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,690
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it means you know getting a</font>

82
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:23,159
second parties eyes on code it can be

83
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,770
from a security perspective it can be

84
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,900
from a functional perspective generally

85
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,490
you're looking for correctness you're

86
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,760
looking for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know secure coding</font>

87
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,760
practices

88
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:39,360
from the process perspective you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

89
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:40,800
it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> straightforward the tricks</font>

90
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,419
get into what are you doing like

91
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,280
waterfall or if you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps</font>

92
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:46,109
we'll talk about that in a bit but

93
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,599
really is about talking with your

94
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,789
developers talking with your project

95
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:53,539
managers and then actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting your</font>

96
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:57,300
eyes on the code get tools on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code</font>

97
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:59,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">droughts your call sequences so that you</font>

98
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,110
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my model is this</font>

99
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:02,729
is where my<font color="#E5E5E5"> viewer is this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

100
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,289
controllers I understand the

101
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:06,688
architecture of it as it's actually

102
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:08,460
written as opposed to what's in the

103
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:15,750
architecture documents cuz sometimes

104
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:17,188
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the same excuse me so you</font>

105
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,169
know at the end of the day you<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

106
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:21,840
get stuff fixed so you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

107
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:23,008
<font color="#CCCCCC">up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of findings we'll talk</font>

108
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">about some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of those that you'll find</font>

109
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:30,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">here in a bit so what do you use use a</font>

110
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:34,258
pen use a paper you can use tools static

111
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:36,080
code analysis you can you know use

112
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:39,419
documentation that's already generated

113
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,159
basically look at this as a penetration

114
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:43,139
test where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have all</font>

115
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:45,690
the answers in front of you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

116
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:50,849
do a review uh you know penetration

117
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:53,879
tests are all the rage and here you know

118
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:55,259
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to say well is there a</font>

119
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:58,050
sequel injection behind here<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

120
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:00,150
actually jump to that code and look at

121
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the database calls you can look at</font>

122
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of the validation you're like are</font>

123
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,449
they validating right are they

124
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:11,089
validating at all so thats you know

125
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:13,650
really nice so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for well</font>

126
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:16,500
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go line for line through</font>

127
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:19,888
the code it's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be arduous it can</font>

128
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,479
take some time but here's a few things

129
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:24,120
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to look for sequel</font>

130
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,979
injection is a great one to look for why

131
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,360
because the PM's love to know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

132
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:32,159
there it's really easy to find and it's

133
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,339
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make for some really nice</font>

134
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:37,080
impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your organization so how many</font>

135
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:40,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are know what to look for for a</font>

136
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:44,250
sequel injection how many don't

137
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:48,300
awesome so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> general problem with</font>

138
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:51,510
sequel injection is when a developer

139
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,580
will do string concatenation in side of

140
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:56,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">your sequel statement so instead of</font>

141
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:59,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">using prepared statements in Java</font>

142
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:01,290
there's other things in other languages

143
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,230
what they'll do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they'll string</font>

144
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,810
concatenate and basically make a more

145
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,340
specific sequel statement such as this

146
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,260
one where you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at you know</font>

147
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,869
selecting the few fields out of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> table</font>

148
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:19,320
called golden table with an ID equal to

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:22,890
/ am one if / am one happens to sorry if

150
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,590
pram one happens to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> five no problem</font>

151
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:28,320
if pram<font color="#CCCCCC"> five happens to be five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Union</font>

152
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,119
select ID and username and password from

153
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,800
your user table you're going to get

154
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,480
yourself into a world of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurt really</font>

155
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:39,150
quickly so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you actually want to so</font>

156
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,980
and that's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the integral</font>

157
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,929
looks like you know you wind up with

158
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:46,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">five where you wind up with five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Union</font>

159
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:49,140
select ID from username password and a

160
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,180
world of hurt so instead what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

161
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:54,650
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for is a prepared statement in</font>

162
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:59,130
Java there's other options in Ruby and

163
00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:00,780
what have you but with<font color="#E5E5E5"> both of those you</font>

164
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,730
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> wind up with any problem because</font>

165
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:07,460
those in<font color="#E5E5E5"> those prepare statements who</font>

166
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:10,620
ends up passing the prepared value like

167
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,690
five lines down set string that first

168
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,160
parameter as a value instead of altering

169
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:18,600
the string that's what's really

170
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:22,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">important parameter validation is</font>

171
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,120
another great fine for code reviews<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

172
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:27,120
need to look for basically two things

173
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,160
correctness of the validation if there's

174
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,630
any validation at all and making sure

175
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,150
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's server side if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a</font>

176
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:35,159
web application web developers love

177
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:39,630
doing their validation on client side

178
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:41,549
it's better user experience but in all

179
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:45,360
honesty<font color="#CCCCCC"> that provides absolutely no</font>

180
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:47,939
security and gives attackers a good idea

181
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,780
of you know what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> value valid field</font>

182
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">should actually look like you know when</font>

183
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:57,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you actually dive down into it</font>

184
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,560
is valid equals true you know you should

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably writing unit tests for things</font>

186
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,209
that aren't integers there I like

187
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:06,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">writing unit tests and integrating them</font>

188
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:08,190
in with the developers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way they get</font>

189
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,020
to see you know validations that

190
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:15,150
actually work and it you know gets them

191
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,120
in the mindset<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know unit tests</font>

192
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,860
are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and it's not just for</font>

193
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,530
individual widgets it's for you know

194
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:26,280
little functions that actually you know

195
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:29,220
protect the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well so cross-site</font>

196
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:32,790
scripting another one that's more

197
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:36,600
difficult too hot to find a but

198
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:40,640
generally here isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> pardon me you're</font>

199
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:44,550
looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> where user input is not</font>

200
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,730
escaped as user output what people often

201
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,170
forget is not just within an application

202
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:51,270
but you can also wind up with cross-site

203
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,240
scripting where you pull the cross-site

204
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,010
scripting data from<font color="#CCCCCC"> another system and</font>

205
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,560
into your system if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got a lot of b2b</font>

206
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:00,420
traffic maybe you shouldn't be trusting

207
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,369
all the data coming from the other

208
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,520
business or from the other section from

209
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other application they might do</font>

210

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">would you want to trust their data and</font>

212
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,930
of course in the middle of code reviews

213
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,790
something that's not code related but

214
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,530
you know build process related that you

215
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,089
should follow let's take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the components that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually</font>

well<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll actually tell you if you ask</font>

it if they're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right valid ones</font>

00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:49,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes the developers chips sometimes</font>

226
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,640
they don't it's definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> worth you</font>

227
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:56,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">know actually checking that all of those</font>

228
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">are valid and more recent and lastly you</font>

229
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,630
know there's plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other things to</font>

230
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,530
check by one day ahead on these five

231
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:04,920
correctness you're going to be spending

232
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:06,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time no digging through</font>

233
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,560
algorithms making sure that values are

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,350
actually you know getting

235
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,119
side where they're supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be not to</font>

236
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,800
say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ever found a place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where they</font>

237
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,360
are calculating interest wrong but I

238
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:19,140
found a place where they're calculating

239
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,320
interest wrong so you know take some

240
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:25,110
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're got plenty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of time to make</font>

241
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that hey it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> secure but as you get</font>

242
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,620
familiar with it you'll be like that

243
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:34,319
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look entirely correct either</font>

244
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:36,150
take advantage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so um now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've got all these findings from a</font>

your visual inspection be your tools see

<font color="#E5E5E5">probably some things from the interviews</font>

this stuff you know and these are

250

need to be fixed you know bugs so that

255
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:04,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing to do is you know not be a douche</font>

257
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,880
it's real easy to wind up in a situation

alive for three years I think we can

going on with the business the business

272
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:03,209
fixed prioritize your vulnerabilities

273
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:05,850
prioritize your findings you know what's

274

important sequel injection you should

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:12,630
fix that stuff findings<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix are you know</font>

validations you should fix that stuff

those are very easy fixes they are low

impact from the coding perspective

they're low risk from actually you know

00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:49,170
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's one of those things that if</font>

288
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,089
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing direct object access in</font>

289
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:53,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">the web application it's probably</font>

290
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:54,209
prevalent through the application it's

291
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:57,779
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those things where you have to be</font>

292
00:13:54,209 --> 00:14:00,089
very very careful that you don't wind up

293
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:02,250
breaking things because you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

294
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,170
IDs out of the system and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

295
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,670
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that if those ids are going on</font>

296
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:09,390
to other systems they don't break that

297
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:11,640
you know confusion which be odd in this

298
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,380
first place but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there can also be a</font>

299
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:19,339
bunch of other anti-patterns underneath

300
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:21,810
that so buyer beware there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

301
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:24,510
you're on board with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the project manager</font>

302
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,979
you have your prioritized list the next

303
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:29,399
thing to do is get some street cred with

304
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,810
your developers in your dbas the best

305
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,120
way I've found that do this it's

306
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:35,250
actually code with them you know you

307
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,089
know pull up<font color="#CCCCCC"> your sleeves and actually</font>

308
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:40,290
you know take on you know a feature of

309
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:42,450
you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not even let your</font>

310
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,670
vulnerabilities take on something so

311
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:47,100
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're bought into</font>

312
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:48,779
the game and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be working</font>

313
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,880
with them you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to both get to</font>

314
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:54,990
the same goal it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to go in</font>

315
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,480
there and you know tell them you know I

316
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,070
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you all got a sixth listed result</font>

317
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,260
well they got features they got

318
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:03,810
schedules they got you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know all sorts of</font>

319
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,930
pressure coming from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PM there's no</font>

320
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:10,050
reason to come in as you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

321
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:12,390
angry manager or angry engineer from

322
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:14,819
another Department so the best thing to

323
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,860
do is to actually be you know somebody

324
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's committed and bought in with them</font>

325
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:22,950
and they really appreciate them and

326
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:26,220
occasionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a donut from a</font>

327
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:28,020
process perspective the other thing to

328
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,270
be wary with the developers is if they

329
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:32,610
are doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps and you're used to</font>

330
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:35,299
working as in a waterfall environment

331
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:39,389
you need to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

332
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:41,249
buried their processes because their

333
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:43,920
processes will know you over from a

334
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:47,160
security perspective they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

335
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,748
doing releases every you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> every week</font>

336
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:54,269
every two weeks when they might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

337
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:57,269
it every two days there's much<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

338
00:15:54,269 --> 00:16:01,049
dogma and you know pride and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ayla do</font>

339
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:03,419
those releases quickly so start thinking

340
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:05,399
about your findings your vulnerabilities

341
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:07,829
your things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you want to have fixed</font>

342
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,869
as other features get them integrated

343
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:12,179
into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> schedule get them prioritized</font>

344
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:14,579
right along with everything else have

345
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:18,809
the patience with them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> be another</font>

346
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:22,378
stakeholder so appreciate that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

347
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:23,669
after your first mass of Thicke's you're

348
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:27,029
probably going to wind up in some sort

349
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:31,980
of maintenance mode with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

350
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:36,449
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> during your project so yeah</font>

351
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:37,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">there type in the way there so what do</font>

352
00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:39,679
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do when you go into</font>

353
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:41,999
maintenance mode well you're wanting to

354
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,629
mature<font color="#E5E5E5"> your processes you want to get</font>

355
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:49,049
them automated make sure that you become

356
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:51,899
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> much of the process and getting code</font>

357
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:55,069
reviewed and getting it into a deployed

358
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:58,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">state you know and github use and</font>

359
00:16:55,069 --> 00:17:00,929
integrate yourself in to get flow when

360
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:03,119
they seized code that might be security

361
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:04,859
relevant say hey could<font color="#E5E5E5"> you at least tag</font>

362
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:06,480
me on as a potential reviewer so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

363
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:10,049
look at the code and provide some

364
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:13,139
feedback you know if you know get you're

365
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:14,730
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some good street cred from</font>

366
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:18,269
your developers and that will certainly

367
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">work the other thing to do is automate</font>

368
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:24,029
as much as you can you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pull</font>

369
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:27,089
nightly from their code base and you

370
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:29,190
know run tools you know make yourself a

371
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:31,049
little data warehouse make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

372
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,090
know if things start trending too bad

373
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:35,389
you know you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved get an alert</font>

374
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,730
maybe even<font color="#CCCCCC"> say no you can't deploy it</font>

375
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:40,080
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much you trust your tools</font>

376
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,940
there's some things tools find very well

377
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,830
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't tools</font>

378
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,850
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have yet to find actually do do</font>

379
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:49,370
validation checks well at all

380
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:52,760
you know miss a vendor wants to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

381
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:54,320
otherwise great I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> love to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

382
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,629
of course you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know work with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

383
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,330
continually the<font color="#CCCCCC"> prioritize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work find new</font>

384
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:02,360
findings get them integrated in<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

385
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:05,270
features and keep trucking along you're

386
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:08,389
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just another stakeholder keep going</font>

387
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:11,059
along on the DevOps train what I'm

388
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:12,530
waterfall you got a little bit more time

389
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:17,539
but you know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still going to stay</font>

390
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:20,270
involved no final tips and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

391
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:21,950
to reiterate you know patience and

392
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:25,250
endurance these are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be long</font>

393
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:28,580
slogs you know if you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a thousand</font>

394
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,690
findings within a big stack of code it's

395
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,960
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take some time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get through</font>

396
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's okay you know if you find</font>

397
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,549
some really critical findings you might

398
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,720
want to stick them on your risk log

399
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:42,679
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not going to be able to</font>

400
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,179
get to them as quickly as you know some

401
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:47,090
others there's some things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

402
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:50,929
going to be so small you know silly

403
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:53,360
typing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that you don't want to</font>

404
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:56,539
necessarily throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your risk log but</font>

405
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,520
you eventually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address so keep</font>

406
00:18:56,539 --> 00:19:00,110
that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind and of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a teacher</font>

407
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,950
will always need more security

408
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:06,889
professionals greven developer or two or

409
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:09,679
three and you know teach them about what

410
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:11,419
you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they might be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

411
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:16,220
you know bring two or three of their own

412
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:18,650
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of good of course I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pull</font>

413
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:22,190
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of things from wasp everybody</font>

414
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:25,429
should read a loss the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 for 2017</font>

415
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:28,340
should be coming out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of beta very soon</font>

416
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:30,110
it's already released it's changed a

417
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:35,030
little bit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> still basically the same</font>

418
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:38,360
for 2013 so that's worth it and finally

419
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:40,460
special thanks to a bunch of people be
