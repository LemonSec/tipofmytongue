12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,280
here because you have some interest in

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,989
answer to this question so I wanted to

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">start with a quick survey how many</font>

15
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,309
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the answer to the question</font>

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,010
is yes just show of hands so no right or

17
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,440
wrong answer just a curiosity all the

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:56,730
DoD employees raise their hands how many

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,930
people think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer is no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how</font>

20
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">many people are just kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of waiting for</font>

21
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:04,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">me to see what I have to say and many</font>

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:09,570
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> think let's just get going more</font>

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:12,060
important things I the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason this</font>

24
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,759
question came about I had a customer

25
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:20,490
many many years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and probably almost</font>

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:23,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 years ago I was doing pci at the time</font>

27
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,229
and it's good that you can't see a lot

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,270
of detail on that because it's the pcs

29
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:31,259
standard I had a retail customer that we

30
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,100
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> having a discussion about</font>

31
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,439
encryption and the options for

32
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,809
protecting data credit card data at rest

33
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">and storage so I was going over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

34
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">details all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the options that PCI gives</font>

35
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,380
you encryption being one of them where

36
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,180
they call it strong cryptography and

37
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,890
because i have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DoD background and</font>

38
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,710
actually trained as a cryptologist

39
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,119
script analysts<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

40
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">into more detail that they were</font>

41
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,799
interested in nobody's ever had that

42
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,540
experience before right where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> geek</font>

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,570
out a little bit much too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much on the</font>

44
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,759
details but we had this conversation

45
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,508
about all the different options and at

46
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,869
the end they said yeah we don't need DoD

47
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,359
level security

48
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:16,360
sell women's underwear or whatever it

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,099
was at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's funny I you</font>

50
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,080
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've had variations of that comment</font>

51
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:22,810
come back to me from customers over the

52
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,810
years I spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years doing PCI as aqsa</font>

53
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:29,440
and there was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of we sell shoes we</font>

54
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,720
sell you know the home<font color="#E5E5E5"> depot breach the</font>

55
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,250
CEO literally said we saw hammers and I

56
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,290
guess that's what that's what retailers

57
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,959
say all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time why should anybody care</font>

58
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,849
about us so that question actually

59
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,739
because this person said it to me eight

60
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:43,899
or nine years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago it's just stuck in my</font>

61
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:49,239
head<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this many years it always keeps</font>

62
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:50,920
coming back to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I decided to based</font>

on recent events will go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

64
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,640

65
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,500
have a talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and just talk</font>

66
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,869

eligible receiver was an exercise<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

94
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:15,010
NSA did it was basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

95
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,959
coordinated<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten test of the DoD happened</font>

96
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:20,620
back in 1997 so there's a whole chapter

97
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,570
about it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that chapter there's this</font>

98
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,880
paragraph starting off the NSA had a

99
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,909
similar group called the<font color="#CCCCCC"> red team yada</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">yada yada yada station in Phoenix yada</font>

yada yada during its most sensitive

102
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,040
drills the red team work out of the

103
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,400
chamber called the pit which was so

104
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,350
secret<font color="#CCCCCC"> that few people of NSA knew it</font>

105
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,030
existed and even they couldn't enter

106
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,290
without first passing through<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:47,710
combination<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock doors not 12</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah this</font>

108
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:49,570
thing is annoying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you</font>

109
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:52,719
today I actually was a founding member

110
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:55,780
of the pit it was our office we sat in

111
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,270
cubicles and we were the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first red team</font>

112
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,830
we didn't call<font color="#E5E5E5"> ourselves up back then we</font>

113
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,680
caught ourselves hackers but we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

114
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:06,250
first red team at NSA this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fanx</font>

115
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,840
complex it's just outside a DWI airport

116
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,960
south of Baltimore<font color="#CCCCCC"> it may be ever been</font>

117
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,419
to bwi airport there's a series of

118
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,190
buildings there it's a good rule of

119
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,390
thumb if you're in the Maryland area if

120
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,550
there's a building with a barbed wire

121
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:21,580
fence around it it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a DoD</font>

122
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:24,550
facility and the pit was actually in

123
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,620
this building here Phoenix<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 on that</font>

126
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,979
who's real it wasn't exactly what the

127
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,599
book made it out to be so you can tell

128
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:41,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">people now that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know somebody from</font>

kept tabs on us over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> years I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

146
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,830
see her every once in a while I saw her

147
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,420
back at RSA earlier this year and even

148
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">though we might not have talked until</font>

149
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,230
here for a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> or so she always seemed</font>

150
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,540
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was doing she kept tabs</font>

151
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:39,750
on all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> her kids so I was one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of her</font>

152
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:42,930
kids so take a picture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that or find</font>

153
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,280
the video when one sits it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

154
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,960
good about putting it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll probably</font>

155
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">up an hour after I'm done talking but</font>

156
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,299
that's a link to an oral history

157
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,240
interview that she conducted a few years

158
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,710
back if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> a student of info SEC</font>

159
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,390
which you should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

160
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,430
business i encourage you to find that

161
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">and read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're writing it down</font>

162
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,570
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when you got it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font>

163
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,220
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up there a little bit longer but</font>

164
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,920
she was kind of in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the beginning</font>

165
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,590
she's been instrumental in a lot of

166
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies and a lot of industries she</font>

167
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:15,919
was one of the founders or pioneers of

168
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,300
this concept of intrusion detection so

169
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,860
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know about and take for</font>

170
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:26,790
granted today she probably has a

171
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:29,490
thumbprint on yes good sorry my career

172
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:31,830
as thing about this earlier my career in

173
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,990
info security and hacking that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

174
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:38,340
actually got paid<font color="#CCCCCC"> for started in</font>

175
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:41,850
nineteen eighty-four it was not at NSA

176
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:44,580
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was still in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> college and I got</font>

177
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:46,890
a summer internship at a at a Navy

178
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,990
facility called the Naval Surface

179
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:52,440
weapons<font color="#CCCCCC"> Center that's kind of like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 50</font>

180
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:56,730
style postcard of it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of</font>

181
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:59,130
what it looked like and my job<font color="#E5E5E5"> was to</font>

182
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:01,590
work for a physicist<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was doing any</font>

183
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:04,740
submarine warfare and he had this filing

184
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:06,780
cabinet full of years and years worth of

185
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,330
research materials lots of documents

186
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,500
books reports white papers a lot of

187
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,900
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he'd checked out of the</font>

188
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,210
Technical Library this was a research

189
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,979
lab and he had gotten<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahold of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

190
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,128
money and was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy one of these</font>

191
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">new fangled</font>

192
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:23,379
top pcs and I'm pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that's the</font>

193
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:25,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">model that he got that and so I was</font>

194
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:27,969
hired as a summer intern basically to go

195
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,889
through that filing cabinet and try to

196
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:32,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">catalog it and he had some database</font>

197
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:34,810
software and I was supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

198
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:37,209
rudimentary database that just kind of

199
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:40,750
catalogued the context of what he had in

200
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:43,239
his safe when he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to explain</font>

201
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,730
to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> any submarine warfare ii so the</font>

202
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,380
best<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to learn about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is read this</font>

203
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:51,339
book it had just been published like

204
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:54,279
within the last year 83 84 so the first

205
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:55,779
week is a college student summer intern

206
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,870
working for the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got to read</font>

207
00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:01,300
a book which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought was cool you know</font>

208
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:04,420
the hunt for red october people heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

209
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,099
it read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it read it you know Tom Clancy</font>

210
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,079
is famous for writing these these

211
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,750
fictional novels based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source</font>

212
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:13,209
and and he got<font color="#E5E5E5"> in trouble early and</font>

213
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,699
often because he nailed stuff pretty

214
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,810
well in terms of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> accuracy of things</font>

215
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:19,300
that were supposed to be classified

216
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">information but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yet he had a way of</font>

217
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,339
weeding through and finding the open

218
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:28,479
source information but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

219
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:31,930
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my story my first lesson in</font>

220
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,939
security came early<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in my assignment</font>

221
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:37,300
where I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> in to the office one</font>

222
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:40,240
morning and opened up the safe and there

223
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:43,449
was this pink piece of paper inside of

224
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,459
it saying come see us at security so the

225
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:48,969
long and short of it was that I had left

226
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:55,359
the safe unlocked so I i I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

227
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:56,560
trouble<font color="#E5E5E5"> I violated the rules and you</font>

228
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,500
know if you're if you're into hacking

229
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,300
and safe cracking and lock picking and

230
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,730
if you're familiar with combination

231
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,380
locks I learned the hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> way you need to</font>

232
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,600
spin the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> several times to get all</font>

233
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,250
the tumblers to set and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

234
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,899
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it on purpose they'd only</font>

235
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,639
turn it a little bit so they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

236
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:13,959
lazy the next morning and come in and

237
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:15,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">just turn it a little bit and open to</font>

238
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:17,469
say it's and be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their way nobody ever</font>

239
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,779
takes shortcuts in the industry right

240
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,220
well if they can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> manually and</font>

241
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:23,829
that's one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reasons why they</font>

242
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,269
wouldn't they would check but I was

243
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:26,180
young<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I was naive and I thought</font>

244
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:28,250
what's the big

245
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a building that's</font>

246
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:33,890
surrounded by barbed<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire fence there's</font>

247
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:35,420
a perimeter there's there's a front desk

248
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:38,000
you have to get through you have to pass

249
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,520
a security checkpoint I was I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

250
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,830
badge somebody had to recognize me let

251
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,260
me in the office<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was in had a</font>

252
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:47,330
lock on it had a combination<font color="#CCCCCC"> locks he</font>

253
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,430
had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the combination to get in</font>

254
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:51,140
the office<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they had security that</font>

255
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,660
would roam the halls and be looking for

256
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,040
intruders and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that weren't where</font>

257
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,899
they were supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be so I thought</font>

258
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,579
well what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big deal so I left the</font>

259
00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:00,440
safe unlocks surely there's lots of

260
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">layers of security that it doesn't</font>

261
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter that I didn't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this one thing</font>

262
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,950
so hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> that thought will come back to</font>

263
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,959
that but that's that was my first lesson

264
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:13,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was my early introduction into this</font>

265
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:16,130
thing we call<font color="#E5E5E5"> security so does DoD level</font>

266
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,510
security work in the real world the

267
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,910
first thing we probably should do is

268
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,550
just kind of level set on on terminology

269
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:27,170
what are we talking about when we talk

270
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:29,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">DoD level security in my travels in my</font>

271
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,550
career<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in discussions where DoD</font>

272
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,800
level security has come up i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think most</font>

273
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,209
people in what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i call the real world</font>

274
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,400
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the commercial world the</font>

275
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:40,550
non-government world<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think most people</font>

276
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:43,069
view that level of security is you know

277
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,750
unlimited funding unlimited<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to</font>

278
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,670
technology you can buy one of everything

279
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:49,100
you can apply everything everybody's

280
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:51,349
focused on it so this ends degree of

281
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,270
security and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like using movie</font>

282
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:57,470
references and they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what movie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

283
00:11:53,270 --> 00:12:01,850
is very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get a you pass this</font>

current or former DoD employees might be

286
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,510
familiar with some of these terms I've

287
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,189
been out of the government<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 20 years</font>

288
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">so there's there's new terms that have</font>

289
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:15,380
emerged that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of DoD level</font>

00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,510
security at least my understanding other

291
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,220
from my background is there's lots of

292
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">different aspects to it there's lots of</font>

293
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,950
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> elements to it based on</font>

294
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,229
usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of objective or</font>

was<font color="#CCCCCC"> developed</font>

00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:45,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">nation-state started doing fancy things</font>

301
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:48,240
like maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> frequency-hopping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they had to</font>

302
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,250
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a way of discovering ways</font>

303
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,870
to detect the signals at different

304
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:54,210
frequencies so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always been this</font>

305
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,590
kind of cat and mouse<font color="#CCCCCC"> game and in the</font>

00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,420
government everything has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an</font>

307
00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:00,450
abbreviation so you come up with these

308
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:03,479
cool little phrases for things so<font color="#CCCCCC"> op SEC</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">elements lots of different things going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">on but what I learned in the DoD where I</font>

was<font color="#E5E5E5"> first introduced</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a risk model was</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that all these things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you do are</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of variations on the risk equation</font>

320
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,050
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> google it and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe in</font>

321
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,700
simplifying things so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most basic</font>

322
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:45,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">elements of a risk equation are</font>

323
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,710
basically these coming up with values

324
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,600
coming up with the algorithms and the

325
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:51,780
mathematics I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to get too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

326
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,390
into that but at its most basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> level a</font>

327
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:56,730
risk equation is you've got some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

328
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:59,240
vulnerabilities and you've got threats

329
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:01,560
and you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reduce them or lower them</font>

330
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,010
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> applying some sort of countermeasures</font>

331
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,719
and all the end result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all that is</font>

332
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,510
this thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we call risk and the</font>

333
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,320
goal is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to risk to be lower</font>

334
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:15,900
whatever the value is and that's not

335
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily something that's defined or</font>

336
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,760
finite but you know it's sometimes

337
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,619
conceptual but conceptually you want

338
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:26,040
your risks lower and that means you're

339
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:28,290
safer in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DoD context think of it</font>

340
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">like this risk in terms of national</font>

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:33,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">security and in terms of protecting the</font>

342
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:35,970

associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with human life the risk</font>

vulnerability management and tender

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,940
threat is a big thing in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

advertising and marketing for a lot of

357
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,930
companies these days but if you wanna

358
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,610
have some fun go around and some

359
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,899
companies to talk about vulnerabilities

360
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,700
and threat and ask them what the term

361
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:17,440
just means so what do you mean by<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat</font>

362
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,420
what is a threat and see if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

363
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,610
consistent answer by the same them by

the people in any individual booth<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font>

alone let alone<font color="#CCCCCC"> going from vendor to</font>

366
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,620
vendor to vendor the way I learned it is

367
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,450
a vulnerability is a weakness that's pre

368
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,950
vague it's pretty undefined it's pretty

369
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,329
generic and it could mean lots of

370
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,490
different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have lots of</font>

371
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:39,550
different vulnerabilities automated

375
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:49,390
levels of weakness a threat again the

376
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:51,250
way I was taught in DoD style is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

377
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:54,220
it's somebody that wants to do something

378
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:57,610
bad to you steal your data prevent you

379
00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:02,620
from doing something defeat you in a

military<font color="#E5E5E5"> conflict it's a food very often</font>

381
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:08,640
in our world these days I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what we</font>

382
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,589
used to call threat agents that the hell

383
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:14,649
the who's I'm starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sound like dr.</font>

384
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:17,649
Seuss the how the who's do what they

385
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:19,690
want to do on the box with a fox is is

386
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:22,120
what is oftentimes referred to as a

387
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:24,399
threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I think of it more as a threat</font>

388
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,790
agent or a threatened vehicle a ways to

389
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">end a means to an end but the threat is</font>

390
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:33,269
a who<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then countermeasures</font>

391
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,380
mitigation is anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do to prevent</font>

392
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:37,209
obviously a lot of what's been done in

393
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:40,839
our industry over the last 20 25 years

394
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:42,040
is try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce vulnerabilities so</font>

395
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:43,240
that's a countermeasure that's a

396
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,319
mitigation and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

397
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,270
technology out there to do that

398
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:50,660
threat detection threatened<font color="#E5E5E5"> threatened</font>

399
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:52,699
mitigation isolating the threats there's

400
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,959
all sorts of marketing and tools out

401
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,240
there that are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something</font>

402
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,980
associated with threat but there's also

403
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,750
other things beyond that you know

404
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,390
perimeter protections firewalls

405
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:05,420
preventing access to monitoring

406
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:08,329
detection anything you do that's trying

407
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,949
to to counteract the effects of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact</font>

408
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:11,750
that and can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all agree that</font>

409
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:14,630
vulnerabilities are here to stay they're

410
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">not going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go away maybe maybe the</font>

411
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,690
goal isn't necessarily to reduce them

412
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,698
but to manage them or at least

413
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:21,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">acknowledge that it there and lose move</font>

414
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:23,420
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to something else countermeasures and</font>

415
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,609

they do and that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the essence of</font>

some of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that we can do</font>

419
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:34,160
maybe beyond focusing the way it seems

420
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:36,110
like we've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> for many years on</font>

vulnerabilities and driving but the

number of vulnerabilities down or

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,120
driving down the threats if that's

424
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,170
possible most of you guys if you've been

425

in the business for a while you're

426

probably familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the concept of</font>

429
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,460
of data protection and data security

430
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:57,350
again my background is really

431
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,950
fundamentally<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec information</font>

432
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:03,080
security or data security there are

433
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,460
variations or there's some new things

434
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">that have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come up because of Technology</font>

435
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and because of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the computer age and</font>

436
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,630
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are done on the computer</font>

437
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:13,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like attribution which we might</font>

438
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:16,610
have been talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in the media the</font>

440
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,030
are sort of variations on a theme

441
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:22,850
because they don't strictly have to do

442
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:24,680
with data itself it's more the this the

443
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:27,080
side effect of the fact that we do all

444
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,900
of our communicating on you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

internet and and very fast and very fast

446
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,820
forms of communication these days but

447
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,950
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> at its most basic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> level we're</font>

448
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about three different things can</font>

449
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,060
somebody steal your data can somebody

450
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:43,220
alter your data can somebody prevent

451
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:46,710
your data from getting it to who you

00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,690
familiar with one-time pads it is

458
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:02,940
perfect security it it's not

459
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,580
cryptographically breakable because

460
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,289
you're using a random key using some

sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm to combine it to your</font>

and one end gets one copy one in gets

469

the other copy you use a page you

470
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:29,820
destroyed quite literally the one-time

field they were printed very small could

00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,630
fit in the heel of your shoe you could

474
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,460
imagine why they were printed on rice

475
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,649
paper that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was somewhat edible and</font>

476
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,990
occasionally we would use non-toxic pink

00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:46,049
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> people would eat it here so just</font>

478
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:47,940
think spy movies I think spy museum and

479
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:52,049
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of stuff that we used to</font>

480
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,760
do we've sat you know where they

<font color="#E5E5E5">yes we've sacrificed all that we've</font>

483
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:01,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">sacrificed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security in my opinion in</font>

00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:04,529
some ways for<font color="#CCCCCC"> speed and convenience the</font>

485
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:08,189
internet so it's all been downhill from

486
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:10,080
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-time pad so going back to the</font>

487
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,390
the conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had with a customer</font>

488
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:17,789
many years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago we don't know we don't</font>

489
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:19,950
need the FD level security I think what

490
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:21,929
I've asked people and of course some of

491
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are my thoughts there's reasons</font>

492
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:26,250
why sometimes the answer is no and again

493
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's this perception that DoD level</font>

494
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,809
security is some degree of security

495
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,539
which obviously costs a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

496
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:35,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">is very complicated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement and it</font>

497
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:38,070
requires a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of personnel and this all</font>

498
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:41,610
has to start sounding like dollars and

499
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,720
cents dollars and cents frankly a lot of

500
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,309
the companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done business</font>

501
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,049
with over the years especially in the

502
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,700
retail space until the internet came

503
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:49,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">along they didn't really deal with</font>

504
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,840
security at all I mean they had

505
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:54,450
shoplifting and things like that they

506
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,260
call that data loss prevention most of

507
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,790
the time

508
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,520
but they weren't really concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

509
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:02,580
data security and electronic security

510
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,440
and internet security computer security

511
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,870
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> they wanted to call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it they</font>

512
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">simply were retail shops and they wanted</font>

513
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make sure people weren't stealing</font>

514
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,850
their goods and they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font>

515
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:14,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">there wasn't fraud being committed so</font>

516
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:16,679
not a core competency and frankly a lot

517
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,600
of companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll hear a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talks</font>

518
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,600
and there's this there's this underlying

519
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,899
belief that every company out there has

520
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,939
this organizational structure the

521
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:29,070
naturally<font color="#CCCCCC"> involves security and there's</font>

522
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,830
roles and responsibilities and everybody

523
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:34,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of does it the same way reality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

524
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:37,260
that very often doesn't exist very often

525
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:39,990
it's a small IT shop and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's IT</font>

526
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:42,390
and computers security naturally becomes

527
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:45,630
a part of that so people<font color="#E5E5E5"> take on more</font>

528
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:46,560
responsibility they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> burned out so on</font>

529
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,620
and so forth and then you have your

530
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,230
keynote address from this morning so

531
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:55,709
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons but</font>

532
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:57,480
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all those reasons I look back and</font>

533
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:59,880
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example of a this is</font>

534
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,880
hopefully sanitized and redacted that

535
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,710
this was an actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network diagram that</font>

536
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,100
I collected from a customer many years

537
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated there pci says</font>

538
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:12,719
you know if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to if you want to</font>

539
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,370
simplify your your security requirements

540
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,280
your compliance requirements isolate

541
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:19,229
your PCI your card data to a card data

542
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,790
environment so that's represented in

543
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:25,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">this diagram by red circles so clearly</font>

544
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:26,610
there's network segmentation there and

545
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,320
there's not any issues with cost

546
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:33,389
communications over less trusted

547
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,740
networks my point being we need to do

548
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,180
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> more and most of the time</font>

549
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,400
because companies run complex

550
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:44,550
environments<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do complex things so</font>

551
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:47,760
in the last couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years primarily</font>

552
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:50,669
because of and it's hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep the</font>

553
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,500
slide current quite literally there's

554
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,690
been so many incidents there's been so

555
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,060
many breaches and companies that you

556
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,920
thought wow why would it happen to them

557
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,629
whether they're private sector or

558
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,060
whether they're government whether their

559
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,550
security companies it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

560
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:07,520
matter what we do

561
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:10,010
in industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> breaches keep happening so</font>

562
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,800
my response in my head was yeah maybe we

563
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:14,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">really do need DoD level security so</font>

564
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:19,399
that's why I'm having this talk here

565
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:21,500
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago when I came out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

566
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,060
the private sector we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were mostly going</font>

567
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,140
around two companies trying to convince

568
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,490
and look if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting on the</font>

569
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet you got to start thinking about</font>

570
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,700
security and if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

571
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:31,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about security there's a right</font>

572
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,810
way to do it there's a DoD way of doing

573
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,580
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means you have to have a policy</font>

574
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:36,409
a strategy<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet that write things down</font>

575
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,270
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have procedures you need to</font>

576
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:41,810
have standards it needs to be organized

577
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:44,090
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> systematic you know it needs to be</font>

578
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:47,750
intentional and so we would go around

579
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:49,370
and try to teach about the need for the

580
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,870
right way of doing things if you're

581
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:54,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get into this internet world</font>

582
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,820
and be<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected and things like that</font>

583
00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:03,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">fast forward</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the present</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think a</font>

584
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:07,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of companies in hearing all this</font>

585
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,840
philosophy about security too<font color="#E5E5E5"> often and</font>

586
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:11,570
i think there's lots of reasons why this

587
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,060
happens and i think you know we're at

588
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:15,590
fault at some level I think vendors are

589
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,389
at fault<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some level I think the</font>

590
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,250
buying population the customers our

591
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:22,640
fault for some level but I think too

592
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:24,500
often everybody just goes to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom</font>

593
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,510
line what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to buy how many what</font>

594
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,270
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need where do I put them and then</font>

595
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:30,590
I'm okay you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning is</font>

596
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,910
what you know when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

597
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,679
customers about the need for security

598
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">they say well we've got a firewall so</font>

599
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,100
we're good<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean later on it's like</font>

600
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,750
well we've got IDs in place so we're

601
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,120
good you know and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth</font>

602
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:46,490
fill in the blank<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got one of those</font>

603
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:48,649
so we're good what I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do here for</font>

604
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:51,200
the rest of the talk and this is not

605
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:53,240
meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be me saying this is the way it</font>

606
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,850
is I this is really intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

607
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,140
conversation starter I'm happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you go</font>

608
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,879
away thinking well maybe there is more

609
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,550
to think about in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> DoD level</font>

610
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,410
security maybe there is more to maybe we

611
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:05,510
shouldn't dismiss it and just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

612
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:07,040
keep moving to the solutions maybe we do

613
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,960
need to consider some of the things that

614
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to present here today so my</font>

615
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,820
goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to make you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think if you don't</font>

616
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,770
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's fine but and if you don't</font>

617
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:19,929
agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with me that</font>

618
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:22,960
fine too but at the core<font color="#CCCCCC"> DoD level</font>

619
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:25,000
security is all about data it's it's I'm

620
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,460
an infosec professional information

621
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,340
security professional that's that's what

622
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:33,610
i call myself because that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font>

623
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:40,240
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i started out you guys remember</font>

624
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:42,429
this movie sneakers you know this came

625
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,160
out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety tues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at NSA</font>

626
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:48,550
back in those days and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this wasn't a</font>

627
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:50,410
new concept in this scene and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

628
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:53,620
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the notes the bad guy Ben</font>

629
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:56,440
Kingsley and is he really a bad guy he

630
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:58,510
says to Marty a good guy Robert Redford

631
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,300
there's a war out there old friend of

632
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:04,390
World War<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's not about who's got</font>

633
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:07,750
the most bullets it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> who controls</font>

634
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:10,630
the information what we see in here how

635
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:13,090
we work<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we think it's all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

636
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:15,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">information because that doesn't apply</font>

637
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:19,720
today right we've blown right past that

638
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:21,760
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the information the</font>

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">teach to customers at some level which I</font>

641
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,060
still try to explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people within</font>

642
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:30,370
our community especially the vendor

643
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,540
booths that I go to and try to trip

644
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:34,659
people up because they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

645
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:36,850
meanings of the words to be honest and

00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">be frank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and to be realistic and I'm not</font>

00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:40,510
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might be the big</font>

648
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,850
kingpin that really makes this

649
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:44,920
complicated is there's a new variable

650
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:46,389
when when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think about the applying</font>

00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,460
the risk equation in the commercial

652
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:53,280
world and that is some sense of the

653
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:56,110
value of data and underlying all that is

654
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,910
this when you come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this figure</font>

655
00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:00,820
which is designed to be as low as

possible in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the commercial world this is</font>

dollars and cents this is money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

658
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,290
there's money involved in vulnerability

management there's money involved in

660

threat management there's money involved

in the countermeasures either the cost

666
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:25,940
customers too often over the years

667
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:27,649
they didn't have any concept of the data

was some high level of understanding

especially in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI world will we have</font>

00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,840
to protect the credit card information

672
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:38,240
but then ask them where<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was in their</font>

673
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:44,620
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and usually you got a blank</font>

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,770
you know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the military DoD</font>

678
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:56,629
you're familiar with this the idea of

00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:58,610
data classification which is not

680
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:01,040
hopefully a new concept in the real

world in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the commercial world but what</font>

682
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,850
I've seen over the years in the real

world is too<font color="#E5E5E5"> often its binary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font>

company proprietary information

unclassified or for official use or

it yeah I've been the pharmaceutical

research companies where they've got

research drug information on drugs they

want to protect that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have to</font>

won't say the name of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company i did</font>

something they value very highly if it

699
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:40,489
dries quicker it doesn't smear when you

702
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:48,470
they have patent protection but only for

00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,890
a certain amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time they have some</font>

concept of value of data in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

707
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:03,020
financial insurance banking you got this

708
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:05,740
idea of financial accounting information

customer information protected forever

710
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,730
everything is done binary we either

happened and they either hit the right

00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:34,820
target or they didn't but afterwards it

746
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:36,379
didn't really matter if the bad guys

747
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,299
knew what the coordinates were because

valuable very sensitive information

the opposite end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is information</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">conversation with just a small set of</font>

the sensitivity of that information it

767
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:32,689
wasn't so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much what was said and what</font>

768
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:34,350
was decided while that was important

769
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,330
what was more important

770
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,909
was what we called the methods and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:41,970
sources how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that information was</font>

obtained<font color="#E5E5E5"> and or by who that information</font>

00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:49,080
was obtained that type of information

774
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:52,379
it's important to keep secret oftentimes

775
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:56,280
forever because if you don't you either

776
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:59,970
lose the source which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> often a person</font>

777
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,889
who often becomes deceased or it's a

<font color="#CCCCCC">method like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you had a bug planted</font>

00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:08,070
somewhere or some some way of capturing

the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the bad guys the</font>

something here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they find it destroy</font>

we at the Allies the Brits and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US</font>

were able to read information the

messages off of that that was a closely

799
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,600
there were still countries using it

low-level diplomatic communications

801

that that the Enigma machine was broken

back in the early 40s so 445 almost 50

broken and we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:35:03,089 --> 00:35:08,490
systems and design the layer of systems

853
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:11,730
and we used to try to evaluate how long

854
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:13,109
and how much time and most importantly

855
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:15,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">how much money would it take an</font>

856
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:17,910
adversary to go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these hoops</font>

857
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:20,040
and jumps and our goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> was to make it</font>

858
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:23,460
more expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> than they were willing to</font>

859
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend the money based on the value of</font>

860
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,660
the data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after how does</font>

861
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,368
this apply in the commercial world I

862
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,410
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we understood the</font>

863
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:33,480
value of data perhaps<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

864
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:35,879
understanding of this risk equation

865
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,070
especially since so much of it has to do

866
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,780
with dollars and cents if nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

867
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe we could make more informed</font>

868
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,850
decisions veteran

869
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:47,060
decisions about where and how much much

870
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:52,160
money to invest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the protections based</font>

871
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:53,810
on the value of the data so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you remember</font>

872
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,129
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> story I told you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the beginning</font>

873
00:35:53,810 --> 00:36:00,020
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my early experience of security</font>

874
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:01,550
breaking a rule which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought was kind</font>

875
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">of silly at the time because there was a</font>

876
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:05,960
layers of protections there was a lot of

877
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">different safeguards in place and one</font>

878
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">single failure I thought what's the big</font>

879
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,740
deal but what I've learned over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

880
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:14,690
years and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the lesson that I sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

881
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:18,560
took away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> this early experience is</font>

882
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:21,350
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and looking back on it it really</font>

883
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,110
was reflective of what I call<font color="#CCCCCC"> a culture</font>

884
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:25,850
of security that that organization that

885
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:28,400
I work for back when I was still in

886
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:30,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">college while there was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a perimeter</font>

887
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,310
fence that protected the building

888
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:36,950
everybody understood that that layer of

889
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:38,720
protection provided some level of

890
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:40,609
protection but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't ultimate level</font>

891
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,129
of protection there were ways around it

892
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:44,780
and to some degree there was processes

893
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:47,210
and additional things put in place

894
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the years maybe there's</font>

895
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:51,410
motion detectors built into the fences

896
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:53,330
maybe there's cameras on the fences

897
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:55,430
maybe there's physical patrols that

898
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:57,560
patrol defenses you know looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

899
00:36:55,430 --> 00:37:00,109
the hole that's been dug under the fence

900
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,820
or the hole that's been cut into the

901
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:03,770
fence or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ladder that's been propped</font>

902
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:06,020
over the fence so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't a single</font>

903
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:08,090
protection without processes and

904
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,640
procedures built around that that

905
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:12,650
protection saying with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,810
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the through the front</font>

908
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:19,910
we didn't have those turnstiles in the

909
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:21,799
80s we didn't have RFID in the 80s but

910
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:26,359
you know there's all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> layers and</font>

911
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:28,430
processes many<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations that I work</font>

912
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:31,130
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security guards were rotated on</font>

913
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:33,770
a regular basis not relieve boredom but

914
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:36,680
they didn't want the security guards to

915
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:39,230
get to know people in terms of facial

916
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:41,450
recognition so they wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say Oh Jeff</font>

917
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:43,580
you've been coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> every day for</font>

918
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:45,230
the last three<font color="#CCCCCC"> months of course come in</font>

919
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,509
today not knowing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been fired</font>

920
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:49,280
the day before<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> walked off so</font>

921
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,760
they would rotate people so there wasn't

922
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,370
familiarity it was a

923
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,260
it was a procedure it was a step but it

924
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:57,480
was intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> as part of this culture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

925
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,960
security there was even<font color="#CCCCCC"> at some point</font>

926
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:03,030
where the badges you know was supposed

927
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,770
to be a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> badge and the guards</font>

928
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:07,890
supposed to look at it and say yeah

929
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:10,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's you you know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of times you</font>

930
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:12,629
just wave it and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know sometimes we</font>

931
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:14,670
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> brave a credit card and get by and</font>

932
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:16,920
do stuff like that so there was a time

933
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:18,720
where the the security guard had to

934
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,220
physically touch<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a rule that</font>

935
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,350
came out they had to physically touch

936
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,910
the badge so then the security guards

937
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,040
came up with these wands you know like

938
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:28,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">they whip the antennas offer radios and</font>

939
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,880
so they could<font color="#CCCCCC"> expend it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I've</font>

940
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,380
touched your badge because now they

941
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,060
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it they didn't want to touch</font>

942
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:35,580
this or they were fundamentally lazy

943
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,500
whatever the rule was but again there

944
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,900
was processes there were steps there was

945
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,670
layers but under underneath all that was

946
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,650
most of the people at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization</font>

947
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:45,600
they kind of understood the rules and

948
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">they obeyed them because they knew it</font>

949
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:51,270
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> all part of a bigger plan you know</font>

950
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,280
same with locks from the doors changing

951
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:55,800
the combination to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the door having</font>

952
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,590
layers of security you know but it had

953
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:02,600
two doors didn't really but you can

954
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:05,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">believe it some places did layers steps</font>

955
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:08,700
processes and everybody understood and

956
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,530
the security guards roaming roaming

957
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:13,080
different halls at different times not

958
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:15,450
not having predictable behaviors all

959
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,190
this stuff all these procedures and

960
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:19,649
processes and we haven't even gotten to

961
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:23,190
the computers and the technology yet but

962
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:25,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">again as I look back on it everybody</font>

963
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:27,300
that worked there kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of understood the</font>

964
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:29,549
mission understood the national security

967
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:36,810

<font color="#E5E5E5">follow the rules if I've got a stupid</font>

970
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:46,410
that breaks a rule I'm gonna light into

971
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:47,970
him and voided the guy light into me for

972
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:50,788
doing some silly little thing like

973
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:52,348
leaving a safe unlocks and exposing

974
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:56,160
documents that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting in</font>

975
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:58,769
that thing for 20 years there is a

976
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:03,319
culture there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a belief in an overall</font>

977
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:06,839
mission of security which again is

978
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:08,640
something that the DoD has that perhaps

979
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:11,069
we don't have in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the private</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sector and</font>

980
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,129
and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to some</font>

00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:18,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">applied because they're an idea that</font>

yeah we're a department store<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

we're engaging in a communicative world

and we're taking advantage of

technologies is there a level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

do to our business that's something I've

00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:43,190
tried to do with my customers over the

years with limited success unfortunately

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even just teaching the fact that</font>

995
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,730
security if you believe the vendor

996
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:53,038
community if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you believe our industry</font>

997
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:55,170
very often if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do this you're</font>

998
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:58,170
done or you need to you know obviously

999
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:59,309
update the technology and in these days

1000
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:02,039
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of different</font>

1001
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:04,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology in place and keep it trying</font>

1002
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:07,829
and keep it patched and keep updating

1003
00:41:04,049 --> 00:41:09,660
but there's still this underlying belief

1004
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:11,670
that you kind of set it and forget it

1005
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,529
you know people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to have to</font>

1006
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:15,450
buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the fact that security is</font>

1007
00:41:13,529 --> 00:41:19,829
something you do that it's a lifestyle

1008
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:21,808
so I learned in the DoD that security is

1009
00:41:19,829 --> 00:41:24,869
really a verb it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you</font>

1010
00:41:21,809 --> 00:41:26,339
do it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a place or a state that you</font>

1011
00:41:24,869 --> 00:41:28,769
get to and they're done and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're safe</font>

1012
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:32,160
it's ongoing it's learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1013
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:34,470
iterative its evolutionary so this is

1014
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a slide that I used to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use 20</font>

1015
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:37,950
years ago just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to describe okay if</font>

1016
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:38,970
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get on the internet</font>

1017
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,710
you're going to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about</font>

1018
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:42,830
security you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to understand that</font>

1019
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:47,520
it's a process

1020
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:50,190
apologize it's hard to read now that

1021
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,470
it's evolved you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the I had five</font>

1022
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:54,450
steps<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago we still have in some</font>

1023
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:56,990
instances five steps today I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font>

1024
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:59,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">is based on the cybersecurity framework</font>

1025
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:01,259
the names have<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed a little bit but</font>

1026
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:04,020
there's still this concept of there's

1027
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:08,370
this iterative evolutionary constant

1028
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:10,350
thing that you do if you read this and

1029
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:13,890
if you have a bias like I do you'll

1030
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:15,540
you'll see that this is sort of oriented

1031
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:18,089
towards technology in and of itself

1032
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:22,290
which I submit to you is perhaps

1033
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:24,780
short-sighted data is one asset class

1034
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:26,550
now where I still think and believe in

1035
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,700
most cases data is what it's all about

1036
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:32,370
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is its foundational it's not just</font>

1037
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:34,020
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of many other things but most people</font>

1038
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:36,210
these days think assets are the

1039
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:39,150
computers the technology the server is

1040
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:40,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mobile devices the laptops all the</font>

1041
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:43,170
different stuff that you have in place

1042
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:45,150
that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about it it's all</font>

1043
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:51,030
passing data which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why i believe the</font>

1044
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:53,040
data is fundamental<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1045
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:55,080
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> missing in terms of implementing</font>

1046
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,910
an understanding of the security

1047
00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:00,569
lifecycle or some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things here</font>

1048
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:03,450
that that and you'd be surprised even

1049
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:05,180
for companies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was working with</font>

1050
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:08,460
that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing credit card security</font>

1051
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:09,930
again they would maybe understand they

1052
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,570
were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> protect credit card data</font>

1053
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:14,250
but then asked him where it was and they

1054
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:17,040
were surprised when we would start

1055
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:19,650
finding it in dozens<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different places</font>

1056
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,810
that they had no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1057
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:23,910
the reach and the breadth of where all

1058
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:25,860
this data because it was sales data it

1059
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:27,629
was transaction data we call it big date

1060
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:29,220
of these days it was data that they

1061
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:31,290
could use to help with their loyalty

1062
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:34,140
programs decide what coupons to spit out

1063
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:37,020
so somebody could buy another brand of

1064
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:38,910
diapers or whatever it was but<font color="#E5E5E5"> overall</font>

1065
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,680
there was just not this understanding of

1066
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:42,420
what are we trying to accomplish what is

1067
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,310
the point what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the purpose other than</font>

1068
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:47,690
we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check a box we got to pass</font>

1069
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:47,690
some sort of compliance then

1070
00:43:48,089 --> 00:43:53,230
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very this</font>

1071
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:56,460
is all very often too common that this

1072
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:59,200
stuff is not understood and not applied

1073
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:01,180
so some random parting thoughts well

1074
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,569
maybe not so random<font color="#E5E5E5"> but trying to tie</font>

1075
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:06,460
all this together a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

1076
00:44:04,569 --> 00:44:08,200
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a little bit this in terms</font>

1077
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:11,140
of the blame why things<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the way they</font>

1078
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:13,868
are I blame vendors often even though I

1079
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:15,879
used to work for one briefly I did learn

1080
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:18,099
in my time in vendor land that vendors

1081
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,539
aren't always just lying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you a lot of</font>

1082
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:21,309
times they just don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know who's there</font>

1083
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:23,200
they're making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up as they go along or</font>

1084
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:25,000
they're picking up the buzzwords that

1085
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,890
they think are meaningful or they're

1086
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,880
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to appeal to your pain point you</font>

1087
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:30,490
know they're all the tricks and

1088
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,230
techniques but fundamentally they're

1089
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:34,538
feeding into this what do i need to buy

1090
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:37,299
and most companies don't want to buy

1091
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:39,970
services most company don't want to buy

1092
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:41,980
advisory work that people teaching them

1093
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:44,859
how to do stuff because what do you have

1094
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:47,529
to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end of the day it's much</font>

1095
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:49,000
easier to have that blinky light box in

1096
00:44:47,529 --> 00:44:51,190
the corner<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lights are green</font>

1097
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,839
saying we're good or we have the

1098
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,309
dashboard or the report<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

1099
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:56,609
noticed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the dashboards these</font>

1100
00:44:54,309 --> 00:45:00,609
days for all the products look identical

1101
00:44:56,609 --> 00:45:07,420
why is that I don't know does it work or

1102
00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:09,848
is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> hahaha so to me there's too much</font>

1103
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,740
focus on technology and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a focus on</font>

1104
00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:14,170
the underlying what it is what are we

1105
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:19,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">all about which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is more often than not</font>

1106
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:20,920
data protection I think to be frank<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1107
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:22,538
this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant to be a knock on the</font>

1108
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,720
company that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to work for but I</font>

1109
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:27,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this whole industry emphasizes</font>

1110
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,379
vulnerabilities too much and again I'd

1111
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,089
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is just an idea but</font>

1112
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:33,290
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we focused too much on</font>

1113
00:45:31,089 --> 00:45:35,540
vulnerabilities maybe we move on to and

1114
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:37,130
element of the risk equation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused</font>

1115
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:38,630
the whole industry on something else for

1116
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:41,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">a while we're doing that a little bit</font>

1117
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:42,410
with threat but maybe just<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1118
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:45,020
should move on to countermeasures and

1119
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:47,029
maybe maybe we should move on to

1120
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:49,430
understanding the dollars and cents and

1121
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:52,460
trying to really define risk for what

1122
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:55,520
risk is is it on a previous slide or did

1123
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:57,560
I on a future slide but I hear so many

1124
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,810
people talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about risk and threat is</font>

1125
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:02,090
synonymous there they use those words

1126
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:04,610
interchangeably the risk is the equation

1127
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:06,500
it's that it's the result that we're

1128
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:08,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to get threat is one of the</font>

1129
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:11,300
variables so they're different somehow

1130
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,490
one is a subset of the other we don't

1131
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:15,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about that too much penetration</font>

1132
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:17,600
testing because penetration testing too

1133
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:19,910
often is discovering vulnerabilities I

1134
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:23,240
think penetration testing having<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to</font>

1135
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:25,250
done do having done penetration testing

1136
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,479
I think we should have evolved by now it

1137
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,790
was great in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very beginning to</font>

1138
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,460
discover what was wrong but for

1139
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:32,750
companies that purportedly have some

1140
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:35,150
sort of someone's with a security

1141
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:36,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">program perhaps the penetration testing</font>

1142
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:38,480
should be doing thread emulations

1143
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,220
perhaps it should be the fire drill

1144
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,870
perhaps it should be testing your

1145
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:43,399
response capabilities because if you

1146
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:46,009
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the breaches you know</font>

1147
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,320
the slide that I showed earlier the vast

1148
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:49,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">majority of those companies they didn't</font>

1149
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,110
discover<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they had a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

1150
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody walked in and said hey you've</font>

1151
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:55,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">got a problem you know whether it was</font>

1152
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:58,130
law enforcement the FBI the card brands

1153
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:01,070
saying hey we've traced all the fall

1154
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:04,490
back and guess what it's you sang wait

1155
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:08,000
just some random thoughts but<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font>

1156
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:09,649
know what this is the rainbow<font color="#E5E5E5"> series all</font>

1157
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,310
started with that orange book up there

1158
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:16,550
in the corner where is mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh it</font>

1159
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:17,660
bounces off that screen top left corner

1160
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:20,450
the orange book<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that was</font>

1161
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:22,670
published somebody help me out like 1983

1162
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:26,180
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's been around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1163
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:27,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">while and when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I first read it and and</font>

1164
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:29,330
back when I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at the</font>

1165
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:31,310
rainbow series<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's maybe 10</font>

1166
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:33,350
I don't even know how many up there now

1167
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:36,650
quite literally the second book in the

1168
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:38,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">series</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> orange book was maybe half an</font>

1169
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:40,280
inch thick the next one was maybe

1170
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,540
three-quarters of an inch thick and the

1171
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,820
second one I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember these</font>

1172
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:46,040
title but it was basically how to read

1173
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:48,680
and understand the orange book so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1174
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:50,180
kind of morphed from there and if you

1175
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:54,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's bad and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

1176
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:56,149
over complicated and over analysis this

1177
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:59,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something I saw online a couple of</font>

1178
00:47:56,150 --> 00:48:01,580
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sea so mind map and if</font>

1179
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:05,569
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hold of you can giggle this</font>

1180
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:07,069
and find this to go see so mind map you

1181
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:09,230
can get a high resolution thing so

1182
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:11,630
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of small print under what</font>

1183
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:12,860
what could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be described as domains this</font>

1184
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:14,690
is supposed to be all the different

1185
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:17,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">things as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sea so has to be responsible</font>

1186
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:19,640
for and be an expert on and and there's

1187
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:21,740
might be an exception in there once or

1188
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:23,240
twice but most of the small print items

1189
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:25,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think are tied specifically to a</font>

1190
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,169
product so it's all about technology

1191
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:30,530
it's all about being focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what</font>

1192
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:32,210
products do what for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just an</font>

1193
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:34,520
alternative example again something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1194
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:36,440
saw online somebody tried to map out all

1195
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,540
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> different areas of expertise all the</font>

1196
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,580
domains that are related to the job of

1197
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:43,820
the sea so or the job of the security

1198
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:45,590
department that's that's I don't pretend

1199
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:47,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know everything about all those</font>

1200
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:49,820
domains up there an old<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little about a</font>

1201
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:53,800
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them but that's a lot to swallow</font>

1202
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:57,470
and again it's mostly technology-based

1203
00:48:53,800 --> 00:49:01,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody is familiar with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this mantra</font>

1204
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:03,770
people process and technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> I submit</font>

1205
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:06,439
to you that there's a fourth element

1206
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:08,450
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is purpose in</font>

1207
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:11,150
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DoD our purpose was to save lives</font>

1208
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:12,520
protect our national interests when

1209
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:14,510
you're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> company or an organization</font>

1210
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:17,060
you're going to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different purpose</font>

1211
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:20,690
and security was really the business

1212
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:23,720
that the DoD was end and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

1213
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:26,780
business of an insurance company<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a</font>

1214
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:29,060
convenience store or a gas station but

1215
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:31,220
security does play a role so understand

1216
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:33,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">your purpose understand your context</font>

1217
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:35,299
understand security how it fits into

1218
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:38,330
what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you're trying to accomplish</font>

1219
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:40,060
as a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's when you start then</font>

1220
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:42,710
applying people processes and technology

1221
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:45,529
hopefully having a more informed

1222
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:48,200
understanding of what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be</font>

1223
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:50,420
doing and maybe hopefully I have a bias

1224
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:52,430
from having been a consultant

1225
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:54,349
bit more on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people and processes and</font>

1226
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:57,020
maybe not so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> technology or</font>

1227
00:49:54,349 --> 00:49:58,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">at least before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you invest in the</font>

1228
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:02,839
technology you've gone through the

1229
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:04,730
necessary other steps so remember it's

1230
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:08,509
all about the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know that</font>

1231
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:11,480
because we learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in 1992 Robert</font>

1232
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:13,549
Redford and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ben Kingsley were right i</font>

1233
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,319
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say technology isn't the</font>

1234
00:50:13,549 --> 00:50:18,759
solution it's the problem he can quote

1235
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:22,849
me security is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a state</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you achieve</font>

1236
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:24,680
I'm more and more convinced that and I'm

1237
00:50:22,849 --> 00:50:26,869
a curmudgeon and I think one of the

1238
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,430
definitions of curmudgeons is you have

1239
00:50:26,869 --> 00:50:30,619
more questions and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have the answers</font>

1240
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:32,930
I acknowledge I had more questions and

1241
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:34,280
answers but I do believe that if more

1242
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:36,799
people will have knowledge and awareness

1243
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:40,400
of how they fit into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization</font>

1244
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:42,259
what their role is in terms of the

1245
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,869
business<font color="#CCCCCC"> process and how security</font>

1246
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:47,030
applies to it maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> just maybe we'll</font>

1247
00:50:44,869 --> 00:50:48,470
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting beyond the clicking and</font>

1248
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:51,950
the fishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all that kind of stuff</font>

1249
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:53,839
not perfectly but again I think back to

1250
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:55,848
the first organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work for</font>

1251
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:57,770
everybody understood their role

1252
00:50:55,849 --> 00:51:00,650
everybody understood why it was

1253
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:02,470
important to follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rules and you</font>

1254
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:05,180
know the young kid from college that

1255
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:07,459
maybe it was my hacker mentality thugs

1256
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:10,220
aren't important i can just do what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1257
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:11,839
want and find the way to the end you

1258
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:15,109
know there's there's some sort of

1259
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:17,029
balance there and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go back and</font>

1260
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:20,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">check the tape I don't think I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1261
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:22,250
word<font color="#E5E5E5"> once in this whole talk did I that</font>

1262
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:28,750
one at the bottom and I will not use

to keeping it free they are almost to a

1276
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:03,320
million subscribers I think they're

1277
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:05,780
projected to hit that

1278
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:08,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the next couple weeks because they</font>

1279
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:11,660
get thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of subscribers on a daily</font>

1280
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:13,819
basis it really is free they've got

00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:16,399
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hours of video courses on</font>

1282
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:19,880
there there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information to</font>

1288
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:40,549
see yours truly online there as well

1289
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:43,220
questions comments I'm full of it retire

1290
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:48,620
already because we're beyond this than

1291
00:52:43,220 --> 00:53:02,299
anybody the floor is open your comatose

1292
00:52:48,620 --> 00:53:05,240
somebody's got something yeah but yeah

1293
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:07,580
again I tried to simplify perhaps overly

1294
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:09,350
simplify we used to the first time I

1295
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">learned the risk equation there was two</font>

1296
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:12,950
elements of likelihood one was the

1297
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:14,870
likelihood that if an attack was

1298
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:16,640
attempted it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful and</font>

1299
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:17,990
there was another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that mapped out</font>

1300
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,640
the likelihood that somebody would

1301
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:21,770
attempted to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> after this in the first</font>

1302
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:24,500
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I forget what we called that</font>

1303
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:27,890
technically but you know there there was

1304
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:31,580
a lot of elements and sub variables

1305
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:33,319
subplots to the whole risk equation pci

1306
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:34,970
for example is binary you're either

1307
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,980
doing it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not and they and they</font>

1308
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:39,529
purport to be risk base but<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk-based</font>

1309
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:41,840
in that context means the security

1310
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:44,300
professional should advise you on what's

1311
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:46,460
the best thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and in that context</font>

1312
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:48,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> QSA the qualified security</font>

1314
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,750
but I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find out when I got out of</font>

00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:56,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">PCI that i was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to maybe roughly</font>

1316
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:58,160
one percent of the companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that had to</font>

1317
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:00,350
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI so there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety-nine percent of</font>

1318
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,210
companies out there that don't have the

1319
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:04,759
expert to go to they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that risk</font>

1320
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:08,390
based decision and basically risk-based

1321
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,900
means it's your barrier<font color="#CCCCCC"> derrière if</font>

1322
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:11,430
something bad happens

1323
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,869
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are they left with their left</font>

1324
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:15,750
with the vendors that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> selling them</font>

1325
00:54:12,869 --> 00:54:17,730
saying hey if you sign up with us all

1326
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:20,220
your burden of compliance goes away

1327
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:21,690
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got you covered until</font>

1328
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">something bad happens and you read the</font>

1329
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:26,490
small print and you find out you've

1330
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:28,849
still got the liability so it's an

1331
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:31,618
important factor of the risk equation

1332
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:33,599
and again go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> google there's a</font>

1333
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:39,450
million variations of the risk equation

1334
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:46,319
is why do they don't have a query

1335
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:49,020
related<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question it is widely and</font>

1336
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:52,500
really eating away at sending it okay

1337
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:54,960
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the second discussion along</font>

1338
00:54:52,500 --> 00:55:02,309
that the same things you want break it

1339
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:03,750
down right right or assign it just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few</font>

1340
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:10,650
values you know hundred percent

1341
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:12,539
likelihood fifty percent 25 / 70 it's

1342
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:14,080
good you're thinking but if you your

1343
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:16,360
eyes to come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font>

1344
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Adam or nothing ever happens here right</font>

1345
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:20,140
this is here you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell me</font>

1346
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:23,110
something that I'll never get around<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1347
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:25,990
see actually thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the what</font>

1348
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:34,840
what they did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you still haven't</font>

1349
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:36,549
you sell shoes and design compensation

1350
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:40,900
for the sake of discussion what happens

1351
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:42,850
that it doesn't listen right and that

1352
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:44,560
came about that came up in conversation

1353
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:46,450
a lot with my customers over the years

1354
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,759
and usually what they and what they

1355
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:52,540
asked was what is my competitor doing

1356
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:53,800
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll do is as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much but not more</font>

1357
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:55,390
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're doing because then I</font>

1358
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:58,090
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing best</font>

1359
00:55:55,390 --> 00:56:00,400
practice or and and hopefully I won't

1360
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:01,780
get in trouble when I do get popped<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz</font>

1361
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,300
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot of forgiveness in the</font>

1362
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:06,190
industry you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's a</font>

1363
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:08,620
certain belief that well it could happen

1364
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:10,060
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody which it could and it will</font>

1365
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:11,740
happen to anybody and it's just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font>

1366
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:14,470
of time and you know there before the

1367
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:16,689
grace of<font color="#CCCCCC"> God you know goes I it wasn't</font>

1368
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:19,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">loads this time it was home depot and so</font>

1369
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:22,900
on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth but you know in our</font>

1370
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:27,180
business to you know the likelihood that

1371
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:29,980
somebody can be successful given certain

1372
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:32,770
you know starting points which we know

1373
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:34,060
there's an endless I mean we know

1374
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:36,400
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> is broken and you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1375
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:38,290
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right so the likelihood is high</font>

1376
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,390
then you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the likelihood that</font>

1377
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:45,160
somebody would try it and it used to be

1378
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:47,290
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> belief was well you know a bad</font>

1379
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,180
guy is taking a certain amount of risk

1380
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:51,009
attempting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break in and the belief</font>

1381
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:53,440
was you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> establish beachhead get</font>

1382
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:54,970
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the repository of the gazillion</font>

1383
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,130
records<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data and then be able to</font>

1384
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:58,870
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it out in pc</font>

1385
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:00,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">island in particular the paradigm is</font>

1386
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:02,830
changed now they're installing malware

1387
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:05,230
and they're harvesting and they're

1388
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:06,730
harvesting over time and they're hitting

1389
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:08,860
the small stores that have been largely

1390
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:10,630
ignored because there wasn't the volumes

1391
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:12,520
and so the belief was we got to protect

1392
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:15,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">the large repositories and the little</font>

1393
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:16,630
ones will just kind of you know nobody's

1394
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:20,050
going to bother because they don't want

1395
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:23,260
to risk being caught for<font color="#E5E5E5"> just such a</font>

1396
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:25,530
small payoff but that's changed so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1397
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:27,570
risk and the likelihood has changed yes

1398
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:30,870
so i'll have another conference of<font color="#CCCCCC"> human</font>

00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:15,840
you mean better if it ultimately here is

1415
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:18,500
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> competent here's a harsh sober an</font>

1416
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:21,330
adult analogy that I have for that

1417
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:22,980
because yahoo was a victim I mean they

1418
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:25,200
are a victim of a crime were they

1419
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:27,750
grossly negligent and contributory yes

1420
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,640
but the best analogy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to begin this</font>

1421
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:33,900
conversation that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovered by our</font>

1422
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:38,129
love rogues that's my favorite beer is

1423
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:39,300
is sex crimes against women you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font>

1424
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:42,000
shouldn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been in that neighborhood</font>

1425
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:44,690
why was she wearing that she had it

1426
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,070
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> or recently we could talk about</font>

1427
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:48,660
you know other types of crimes against

1428
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:51,540
other minorities and things like that

1429
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:53,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">but there you know what was her personal</font>

1430
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:56,130
history you know think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all the Bill</font>

1431
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:57,930
Cosby cases and you know Riley most

1432
00:58:56,130 --> 00:59:00,150
recently and and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1433
00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:02,069
being piled up on the accusers and

1434
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:05,400
everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is being said about the</font>

1435
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:07,140
victim so it's not a perfect analogy but

1436
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,880
there is some element at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1437
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:11,190
day companies no matter how grossly

1438
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,320
negligent they were they are victims<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1439
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:15,630
a crime because a bad guy has committed

1440
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:18,360
a crime against them and and done

1441
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:19,950
something could they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have done more to</font>

1442
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,720
prevent it we can certainly have a

1443
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:24,270
conversation about that but I don't want

1444
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:26,790
to lose the element of there is a time

1445
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:28,650
involved here that makes sense and we

1446
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:34,920
can agree to disagree and fight over it

1447
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:38,550
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're discussing more the</font>

1448
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:42,060
different unit<font color="#E5E5E5"> operation someone would</font>

1449
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:44,820
gather actually create any integer

1450
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:46,740
logging system actively ignoring their

1451
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:48,990
security team calling them the paranoid

1452
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:51,540
in it ultimately that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the head of that</font>

1453
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:54,089
you leave their actors where his work

1454
00:59:51,540 --> 01:00:09,060
was appreciated that is not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> pattern</font>

1455
00:59:54,090 --> 01:00:10,470
to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> business as usual yeah</font>

1456
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:13,230
unfortunately we get into though of the

1457
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:15,750
world of you know it's come up mostly

1458
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:18,210
now in IOT and what's the solution for

1459
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:19,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> insecurities of IOT it's going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1460
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:22,290
regulatory and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be fines</font>

1461
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:24,000
and and something coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

1462
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:25,470
government with most most of the time

1463
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,820
our community says we don't want the

1464
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:29,040
government involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> because their wads</font>

1465
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:30,780
and interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee enough as a parting</font>

1466
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:33,000
thought I don't really truly<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font>

1467
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:35,010
that the DoD practices DoD level

1468
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,840
security anymore because all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1469
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:39,270
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew DoD security in the old days</font>

1470
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:41,280
of retired have moved on came out into

1471
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:42,900
the private sector there's there's been

1472
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,090
a lot of institutional knowledge so

1473
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:46,950
there's been this now the DoD looks

1474
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:48,240
outside and tries to apply this stuff

1475
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:51,180
that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing in the commercial</font>

1476
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:53,299
world for better<font color="#CCCCCC"> for worse that's enough</font>

1477
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:56,190
we're out of time thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you very much</font>
