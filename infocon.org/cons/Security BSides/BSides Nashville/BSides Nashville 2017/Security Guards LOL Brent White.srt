1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
tim roberts and we also gives this talk

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,689
with me but unfortunately he had to

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,820
cancel last minute for<font color="#E5E5E5"> family</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> emergency</font>

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,840
so he apologized for that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will try</font>

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do his his red team stories justice</font>

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:20,340
and if not<font color="#E5E5E5"> then he's not here to know</font>

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:24,210
otherwise so so the talk security guards

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,890
LOL wut Tim and I do we do social social

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,920
engineering reading assessments things

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,050
like that and so we've we've realized

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,450
that basically every time we go and do

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,730
one of these types of assessments we run

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,170
into security guards and so we've over

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,040
the years<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've sort of collected all</font>

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,840
these these stories that we've basically

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,930
used the security guard in our favor to

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,450
give us access to locked rooms and

18
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,460
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're going to I'm</font>

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,140
going to share some of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> stories</font>

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,460
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and some of the techniques that</font>

21
00:00:52,140 --> 00:01:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">we use and to sort of show the flaw with</font>

22
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:01,739
having your entire physical physical

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,989
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> resting on the hands of one</font>

24
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:09,420
maybe two security guards that sometimes

25
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:13,289
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care so all right so who am</font>

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,290
i I'm Brent white work with MTG security

27
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,060
and then of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

28
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,439
to put too much emphasis on Who I am

29
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,750
because that's not really important

30
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,820
what's important are the flaws that

31
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,540
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today so and</font>

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:31,770
as you can see very serious and immature

33
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,810
so primary goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the assessment so</font>

34
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,119
before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go in and just start</font>

35
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,799
seeing what you can do with buildings

36
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,869
and what you can get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

37
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,640
have permission from the client<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

38
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">very important unless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you plan on</font>

39
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,189
getting arrested so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there in the kickoff</font>

40
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,009
call you discuss things like okay what's

41
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,860
the point what are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming in to do is</font>

42
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:56,520
it to get into server room is it to get

43
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,140
into files there may be some secret

44
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,990
files or something like that that would

45
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:05,700
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> awful if unauthorized users were to</font>

46
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:08,128
get them what can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do if we get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

47
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,160
server room can we take something out

48
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,660
you know so if there's a server you know

49
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,799
that's not being used as sitting on the

50
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,150
floor can we

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">ariad out of the building can we take</font>

52
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:21,480
laptops things like that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we take</font>

53
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,369
files that we might find so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

54
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,260
all things that you want to you know

55
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:29,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">discuss with the client so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you</font>

56
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:31,530
do take something out it's not you know

57
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">not going to upset them because maybe</font>

58
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,670
it's some sort of classified information

59
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:39,810
or something that should not be outside

60
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:42,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a certain room start and stop time</font>

61
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:46,080
and date that seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty obvious but</font>

62
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,700
we've had issues where the client wasn't

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,420
necessarily maybe not paying attention

64
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,950
or this<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't discussed and so one of</font>

65
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,750
our Assessors thought okay we're

66
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,320
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sunday but they weren't</font>

67
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,760
expecting us until monday or tuesday

68
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,040
they get a call that something's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

69
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,010
on freak out call the police and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

70
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,269
know things escalate from there so you

71
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,600
want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everyone</font>

72
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:12,330
understands when this is happening can

73
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,090
you test can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do physical entry</font>

74
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,890
social engineering after hours or do

75
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">they only want this stuff you know</font>

76
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:24,510
during business hours and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

77
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:27,000
legal documentation something that Tim

78
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I like to do so if if someone</font>

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
approaches you and they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are you</font>

80
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,600
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your cot and you can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,370
out of it then you give them the letter

82
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,760
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorization or what we call the get</font>

83
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:41,850
out of jail free card and that basically

84
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,500
says you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is your who is who</font>

85
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,390
you should call<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here's the</font>

86
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,610
authorization that these guys are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

87
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:50,970
to do this and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll</font>

88
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:53,220
follow their you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know procedures and and</font>

89
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,440
then you go about<font color="#CCCCCC"> your business so</font>

90
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:59,750
something that we like to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we like</font>

91
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,750
to give a fake letter of authorization

92
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,440
this is to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they're actually going</font>

93
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,060
to you know what their response is like

94
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,239
ok they're just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scan this and</font>

95
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,470
like okay this is you know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

96
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,959
ahead go about your business and it was

97
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,400
fake and I'll show you an example one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

98
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,519
our letters it actually has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the address</font>

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the White House and we're just</font>

100
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,480
ridiculous information that way if they

101
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,770
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the time to read that</font>

102
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,180
letter they're going to know something's

103
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,659
up a risk with that is if they read the

104
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,220
letter

105
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,470
are going to know something's up so if

106
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,510
you try to give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> a second letter at</font>

107
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,450
that point you're going to have a lot

108
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:39,170
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that time but I'll get</font>

109
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:42,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">into I'll discuss some ways to sort of</font>

110
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:44,760
de-escalate those situations in a bit so

111
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,530
once you figure out okay why are we here

112
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,870
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we doing when do we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it what</font>

113
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:52,710
are the rules then<font color="#CCCCCC"> and everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

114
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:55,190
signed not just verbal agreements just a

115
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:59,940
little tip there then you're good to go

116
00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:03,570
so yeah I have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> really stupid images</font>

117
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:05,730
on this thing so incident response is

118
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,170
that part of it so what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

119
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:10,470
so when we go in they were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

120
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:11,910
covert assessment we eventually if we're

121
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">going and we're just kind of having our</font>

122
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,380
way in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this building and no one's saying</font>

123
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:20,490
anything how ridiculous do we have to

124
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,800
get before someone will come and stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

125
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:26,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">and say you know what are you doing here</font>

126
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,260
so or is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> not part of it if that's the</font>

127
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:34,500
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we try to stay covert the</font>

128
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:36,599
entire time so again I was talking about

129
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the letter so with this are they</font>

130
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,840
actually following their policies or

131
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,550
just taking a word for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that's the</font>

132
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,710
whole fake letter so if you give them

133
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,720
that are they escalating it to the right

134
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:49,950
people or are they saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay cool you</font>

135
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:52,980
know go ahead so something that a funny

136
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:55,740
story of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tim's is that he was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on site he</font>

137
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,390
had a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> guard catch him while he</font>

138
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">was picking a lock trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get in the</font>

139
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,840
side building and the guard comes over

140
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,390
hey what are you doing and he's like oh

141
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,299
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> just working on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lock any</font>

142
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:08,219
long story short Tim gives this guy the

143
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,160
fake letter it had my phone number on it

144
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,660

146
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:18,510

the place to himself the whole week off

162
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the fake letter of authorization just</font>

163
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:54,400
because they had they built that that

164
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,900
trust you know both<font color="#E5E5E5"> being in you know</font>

166
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">I guess some poor incident response so</font>

167
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:06,099
you always want to make sure is that

168
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:09,639
part of the assessment and by the way

169
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:11,410
dear during this if anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> has any</font>

170
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,900
questions anything I'm saying like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

171
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:16,120
technique or if I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain</font>

172
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,419
something properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I highly encourage</font>

173
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,850
questions or feedback or if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

174
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:34,960
throw money and stuff see that's cool so

175
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:36,550
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> question somebody because now</font>

176
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:41,650
I'm glad you asked that because we have

177
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:43,840
had instances where they knew she had

178
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:46,060
the client that was on the phone call

179
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay this is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen it's the</font>

180
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:51,250
person that we want you guys to<font color="#CCCCCC"> come do</font>

181
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:55,419
this for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's cool so this is</font>

182
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:57,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">when we will send someone out and it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

183
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:59,289
someone that had been there for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

184
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">previous is like a wireless assessment</font>

185
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:05,320
or something and said they had they

186
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:09,400
already knew each other and so as soon

187
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:12,490
as the consultant got on site this guy

188
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,520
that hired them to come do this

189
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,889
immediately like was<font color="#CCCCCC"> walking around</font>

190
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,289
looking for him said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay gotcha you're</font>

191
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:21,970
done and so it's like so you want to

192
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:25,449
obviously avoid that because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

193
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:27,940
a realistic you know assessment of their

194
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:30,220
security posture so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always good to</font>

195
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,679
sort of leave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit anonymous if</font>

196
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:38,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible you know when you're doing</font>

197
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:42,819
those types of assessments so so here

198
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:44,440
this is one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> tim's so I'm going to</font>

199
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,540
read some this and then I'll once I read

200
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,089
it then I'll kind of go into more

201
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:52,270
details so he was a corporate employee

202
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:54,670
and he was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convince the security</font>

203
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,390
guard to open<font color="#E5E5E5"> a biometric authenticated</font>

204
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,670
server room

205
00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:01,750

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:06,640
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he was granted on escorted</font>

207
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:08,550

272
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:01,550
incident response was obviously not

273
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,160
there they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow through with</font>

274
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:06,920
things and tim was able to build rapport

long way I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really can just BS</font>

280
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:20,420

value me like oh well he looks like he

284
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:29,960
knows what he's talking about so those

285
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,930
are that's that's a big thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

286
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,940
use all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time so if you're walking</font>

287
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the building that you're not</font>

288
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">supposed to be and you're kind of you</font>

289
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,339

290
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,020
lost people are going to see like what's

291
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:44,180
this guy doing here is obviously lost

292
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,970
but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk through there like you</font>

293
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,349
own the place you know her you you know

294
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:52,370
look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little upset or</font>

295
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:54,530
something it's a huge deterrent to

296
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:58,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">giving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people will excuse me sir you</font>

297
00:12:54,530 --> 00:13:03,230
know so anyway so he had a fake badge

298
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:05,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so he when he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was on site looking</font>

299
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:08,600
around I looked at what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were</font>

300
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,520
wearing went back to his hotel created

301
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,750
that printed it out and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuck it in</font>

302
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:16,699
a sleeve on front of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> badge the RFID</font>

303
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,600
badge and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just walked around with</font>

304
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,430
that

305
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,740
he said people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will just kind of glance</font>

306
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,750
at that and didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask questions which</font>

307
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,269
is how one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reasons he was able to</font>

308
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:30,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">get so deep into the building where he</font>

309
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:32,630
was outside of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server room so and</font>

310
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:34,430
then at that point while he was in the

311
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:36,980
air again he you know picked the lock to

312
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:41,180
the office<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the guy that said you know</font>

313
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:43,130
good luck and so a tim was pretty happy

314
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,560
about that motivation used it well and

315
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:47,829
then he<font color="#E5E5E5"> also picked locks to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

316
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,910
shredder<font color="#CCCCCC"> benz to also obtain more</font>

317
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:58,219
sensitive information that had not been

318
00:13:49,910 --> 00:14:01,160
shredded yet so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so i'm here from IT</font>

319
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:05,300
security so this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one of my</font>

320
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:08,689
stories so this client a large client

321
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:12,319
and they had three locations so the

322
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,940
first location it was in a shared

323
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:17,180
building and my hotel was right across

324
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,740
the street that's a no scent couldn't

325
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,380
find any pictures of their badges or

326
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,610
anything online which try that you'll be

327
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,089
surprised how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people you know</font>

328
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:27,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll be it a like a work outing or a</font>

329
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:29,360
barbecue or something with their buddies

330
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:30,949
and they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got their badges you know</font>

331
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,750
hanging<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you just zoom in and look</font>

332
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:37,339
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and usually get a pretty decent</font>

333
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:41,720
idea to forge you know your<font color="#CCCCCC"> your badge</font>

334
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:43,069
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said at this little cafe where they</font>

335
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,810
were all having breakfast I got there

336
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:46,790

337
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,949
coming in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and having breakfast and I was</font>

338
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,660

339
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:53,660

00:14:55,579 --> 00:15:00,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">there drinking coffee I'm looking at her</font>

344
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,420

345
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:06,829

the hotel printed it off and I got some

349
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:19,790
odd looks from the front desk when I

350
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:21,680
asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for scissors and tape and was</font>

351
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:23,180
cutting it out like in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them so</font>

357
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,610
confidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> but oh he's a graphic</font>

like to specifically request please do

483
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:07,110
not terminate anyone that we might

484
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:09,140
leverage for any<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of attack because</font>

485
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:12,840
we've we've had issues in the past where

486
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:15,929
security guards were replaced or

487
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:18,299
whatever because we have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

488
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:20,730
get them to completely give us their set

489
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:23,399
of master keys and go where we needed to

490
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,480
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and come back things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that so we</font>

491
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:26,219
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you know please don't</font>

492
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,169
terminate them let us<font color="#E5E5E5"> use this as a</font>

493
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,730
teaching moment because we guarantee

494
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:32,100
they'll never do this again once they

495
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,659
get called out so why get rid of them

496
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then bring someone else in that has</font>

497
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:39,299
to learn the whole thing all over again

498
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:40,949
so so anybody in here that's that does

499
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:43,529
pen testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you know red team stuff</font>

500
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:45,240
like that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a that's a</font>

501
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:47,190
good thing to add in your kick off call

502
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:53,330
because you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want anybody</font>

503
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:56,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">to lose their job over that right so so</font>

504
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:59,330
yeah so I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the all the all</font>

505
00:21:56,429 --> 00:22:02,490
the offices got everything in left and

506
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:05,039
so I had to call the client right away

507
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:08,550
and escalate like hey I did this I got

508
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:10,980
all this information basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

509
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:16,100
owned your entire network and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice</font>

510
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:20,070
a couple hours so I was on the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

511
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:22,980
their bigger location and she's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh</font>

512
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:25,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well that's that sounds really good</font>

513
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:30,450
until she wasn't too thrilled about it

514
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:33,120
so when I pull up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this very very</font>

515
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:35,670
large complex it's a industrial<font color="#CCCCCC"> park</font>

516
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,439
with several buildings and a long road

517
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:39,510
that everyone shared two gigantic

518
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,970
parking lot it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> lunchtime there are a</font>

519
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:45,690
lot of cars in and out long story short

520
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:48,840
as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get out and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> walk walk up to</font>

521
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:52,640
go start this thing I had picked a lock

522
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:55,320
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> adorn but it was like a HVAC room</font>

523
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,700
external<font color="#E5E5E5"> HVAC room the only way I was</font>

524
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,590
getting inside the building is if I was

525
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">crawling through a tunnel and they're</font>

526
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:03,360
like a air duct and I was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

527
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:05,700
so as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I closed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that secured a</font>

528
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,490
security guard comes outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey you</font>

529
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,810
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even give me a chance to explain</font>

530
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything I was like hey man you know</font>

531
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:15,659
here's my letter and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was like you're</font>

532
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,160
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> with me and so we had talked a</font>

533
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:20,490
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he ended up telling me</font>

534
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,550
that he received a phone call and he

535
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:27,120
watched me drive all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

536
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:29,340
parking lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so he he was tipped off</font>

537
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,020
so that was that was unfortunate so

538
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,209
you'll have things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sometimes</font>

539
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:35,700
we'll have those situations<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you</font>

540
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:37,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">know as I mentioned earlier the client</font>

541
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,620
that seeked out you know our co-worker

542
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:44,070
immediately sometimes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you'll</font>

543
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,750
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a unfair situation like</font>

544
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:48,810
that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nothing you can do</font>

545
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:52,680
but comply something you're not you know

546
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:55,760
being tackled to the ground and we do

547
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:59,070
also put language in our agreements that

548
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,680
the client<font color="#CCCCCC"> will go to all measures</font>

549
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:04,350
necessary all means necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ensure</font>

550
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,980
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> local and federal authorities are</font>

551
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:09,899
not contacted which is great because

552
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:12,480
being handcuffed and waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for hours</font>

553
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,760
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours for someone to finally say</font>

554
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,980
yeah he's supposed to be there is I

555
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:21,160
imagine a horrible day so

556
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:25,860
yeah billable yeah I like the way you

557
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">think billable hours that is awesome</font>

558
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:35,080
I've had the opportunity but no because

559
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:37,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">I I made sure to find another way</font>

560
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,889
because that doesn't seem fun because a

582
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:42,190
idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the layout of the property if</font>

602
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,809
and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like 34</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago</font>

603
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:33,389
and they never

604
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:36,450
disabled those so then you're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the access and so that's</font>

606
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:41,429
that's a whole different issue there but

607
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:45,389
take the time to do your research before

608
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:48,450
you go and in another even playing

609
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:50,370
deeper into that let's say you you know

610
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:53,490
who the security guard is or the

611
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:55,258
security guard company that's local then

612
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:58,049
you can learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> about maybe the person</font>

613
00:26:55,259 --> 00:27:00,740
that owns it or an event<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happened</font>

614
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:03,029
recently and you go in and say you know

615
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,470
hey man how's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> goin I heard you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys</font>

616
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:07,379
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know had that issue with that</font>

617
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:08,669
employee last week we were sent over to

618
00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:10,019
look at that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry about that</font>

619
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,340
and then they start telling you all

620
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:13,619
about it and then when you're done

621
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,990
talking you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just walk right by them so</font>

622
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:17,730
you know look for anything you can to

623
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:22,019
make it look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you are familiar</font>

624
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:26,399
you're familiar with that company or

625
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:27,659
whatever they do something else and kind

626
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">of get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an off-track a little bit but</font>

627
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:33,330
just I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is important</font>

628
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:38,610
learn the lingo of whatever the client

629
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:41,039
does so if it's a design firm learn some

630
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:45,209
lingo about design you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever it</font>

631
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:46,590
might be if its financial or whatever do

632
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,960
a little bit of you don't have to be an

633
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:51,749
expert but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to go in there</font>

634
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know sound like an idiot so you</font>

635
00:27:51,749 --> 00:27:56,100
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to go if your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pointer</font>

636
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:58,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">your you're at lunch with an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> employee or</font>

637
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,949
something just some small talk and then

638
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,779
now you're a familiar face to them so if

639
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are trying to get in the door and</font>

640
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:07,320
they see you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh yeah I know that</font>

641
00:28:05,249 --> 00:28:08,279
guy they'll you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know let you in or they</font>

642
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,559

643
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:13,470
around so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that can</font>

644
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:18,139
pay off just do your research know what

645
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:18,139
you're going into and get some more info

646
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:30,240
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a good question too so let's</font>

647
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:32,399
say let's say its financial okay so you

648
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,679
obviously want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out okay what's</font>

649
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:37,168
up what are some trends in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stock</font>

650
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:40,139
market lately what are people concerned

651
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:42,029
about you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> with new new president</font>

652
00:28:40,139 --> 00:28:44,129
and how is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that affecting things you</font>

653
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:44,720
know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of just anything that you</font>

654
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:47,059
could think

655
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,309
be just simple small<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk you don't have</font>

656
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:51,620
to you know open a portfolio and you

657
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:52,730
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh yeah I can't go to the</font>

658
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,408
client yet because I haven't been

659
00:28:52,730 --> 00:29:01,250
trading stocks for years or anything

660
00:28:54,409 --> 00:29:05,270
like that but another way if if you're

661
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:08,419
able to is become a client of that

662
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:11,629
client so if they sell you know health

663
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:13,669
care or whatever see if you can open in

664
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:16,370
some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an account with them just</font>

665
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:20,780
to show interest because then you have

666
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:23,840
credentials for their<font color="#CCCCCC"> webapp you learn</font>

667
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:26,149
who to talk to for you know customer

668
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,580
assistance things like that plus you

669
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:31,340
learn their specific terms so if they

670
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,960
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like their own little generic terms</font>

671
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,090
that they use for products and things

672
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,789
you're familiar with that because you

673
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:40,459
have become a customer now that that's

674
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:43,129
not always something you can do but

675
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:54,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">again just do some research and see if</font>

676
00:29:43,130 --> 00:30:22,909
that's a possibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 no not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yet</font>

677
00:29:54,409 --> 00:30:25,100
here's cross right but it becomes

678
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:27,679
obvious you know sending out<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

679
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,959
doing a fishing campaign and right

680
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,240
before you do it you're like okay what's

681
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,770
going on why I have only two people

682
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,710
click this and no one filled out the

683
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:38,330
form but you do a very similar campaign

684
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,070
and you get you know 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> or 30</font>

685
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:42,530
meterpreter cells in an hour and then

686
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:45,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">you find out that something like that</font>

687
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:47,750
happen and so when you when you are

688
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:50,090
positive and you have enough information

689
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:52,280
where you can you know beyond a shadow

690
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:56,740
of a doubt you know that we're just kind

691
00:30:52,280 --> 00:31:00,399
of sabotage then what we will do

692
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:03,690
for example a client that wanted us to

693
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:08,559
do remote fishing you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is like</font>

694
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:11,770
fishing<font color="#CCCCCC"> vichon all the other ways to</font>

695
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:14,590
pronounce that word so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they said okay</font>

696
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:16,929
you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not allowed to use our company</font>

697
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:19,750
logo on anything you are not allowed to

698
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:23,290
pose as an employee<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are not allowed</font>

699
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:26,230
to pose as a contractor<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so yeah</font>

700
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:28,178
let's do some cold calls you know hi

701
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:30,630
would you like to buy some magazines

702

00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:38,250
and so we do mention we sit like limited

704
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:40,990
due to these restrictions and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

705
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:43,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">we will list those but you have to be</font>

706
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:47,500
very careful about that because it is

707
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:50,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">your client they are paying you and you</font>

708
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:53,290
can you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> will say like well we urge</font>

709
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:58,090
you to not place these restrictions or

710
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:59,800
whatever because attackers aren't going

711
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:02,020
to have those restrictions they will use

712
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:05,530
these methods and they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

713
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:08,679
successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> methods so you need to have a</font>

714
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:11,200
realistic I guess view of what your

715
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:13,679
employees might do in this situation so

716
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,840
we always advise and say this is why we

717
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:19,390
disagree but ultimately if they say I

718
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,360
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care don't do it anyway like yes</font>

719
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:27,220
sir yes ma'am you know thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

720
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:29,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">being your customer which is fine but</font>

721
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:32,350
again there are issues with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so we</font>

722
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,270
mentioned what we can without<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

723
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,939
like well you wouldn't let us do this

724
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:38,559
and you know whoops wasn't fair<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

725
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,210
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not coming back next you know</font>

726
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:53,620
you can't do that so it's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

727
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:55,420
careful how you word it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody that</font>

728
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:57,449
couldn't hear you ask any specific

729
00:32:55,420 --> 00:33:00,850
materials that i use for forging badges

730
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:02,770
if you're in a pinch and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

731
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:05,800
a badge printer or something with you

732
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:07,629
then yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just paper hotel printer if</font>

733
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,639
you need to or like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said earlier a</font>

734
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:11,940
crayon

735
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,610
no just depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the level of</font>

736
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:17,970
seriousness or how difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font>

737
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:20,820
there are some situations or there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

738
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:23,610
some locations where it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult</font>

739
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:26,970
to get in without a badge they're due to

740
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:28,979
man traps and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

741
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:32,460
want your badge to look as legitimate as

742
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:35,550
possible coworker of ours drew

743
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">culbertson had an assessment where it</font>

744
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:39,810
was basically a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of entry</font>

745
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:42,570
everyone was sketchy at him the whole

746
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:45,690
time they basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> ended up</font>

747
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:48,090
interrogating him for a bit and he still

748
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:51,810
got out of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because he friended a</font>

749
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:55,260
badge that looked so legitimate with a

750
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:57,300
an actual printer on you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

751
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:00,270
plastic badge so it looked like a real

752
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:02,760
badge and so even<font color="#CCCCCC"> through this</font>

753
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:05,190
interrogation they still were like<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

754
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,100
he must be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an employee and this I mean</font>

755
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:09,780
so how he got out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know is</font>

756
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,000
incredible he did very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good job on that</font>

757
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,159
so again it just depends on what

758
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,130
resources you have and then you know

759
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:31,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">what how serious</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess that that's</font>

760
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:35,280
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> play so we yeah yeah</font>

761
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:38,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person or that the client that</font>

762
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:43,320
put all those restrictions the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous</font>

763
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:46,949
year the report was not pretty and it

764
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:50,970
was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same person and so I imagine</font>

765
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they did that in a way to maybe</font>

766
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:56,310
protect their position or something

767
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:59,700
could be more things going on politics

768
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:02,220
things like that but we do find that if

769
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:05,700
there is a company that we go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

770
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:08,580
mean we basically tear them apart I hate

771
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,660
to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that way but the next year all</font>

772
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a sudden there's all these</font>

773
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,680
limitations and things which you know

774
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:18,060
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point of view is</font>

775
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:20,910
understandable but real world attackers

776
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,049
again don't have those limitations they

777
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,850
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

778
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:25,560
they have months and months that they

779
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:27,270
could stake something out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do</font>

780
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:30,509
whatever and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we usually have a week two</font>

781
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:37,770
weeks so so yeah that's that's a good

782
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:39,060
point we'll have a few we usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

783
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:42,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">then I took</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them out actually meant to</font>

784
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:44,009
bring all my tools and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff but I left</font>

785
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:47,340
them on my desk and that's not abuse

786
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:51,360
here but we will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few that we keep</font>

787
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:54,060
with us Tim carries a clipboard around

788
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:57,090
it's a hollow clipboard and you open it

789
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:59,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">up and inside of that is a badge cloner</font>

790
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,980
for different types of badges and so

791
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,980
i'll get to that story in a minute but

792
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:07,230
but we we have devices that will you

793
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,750
know trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go in like it was hanging</font>

794
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:11,400
out and I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the clipboard hanging</font>

795
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,350
by my side or something and we're in

796
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,470
line at launch all the standard will

797
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:18,060
close and like oh sorry man and then you

798
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:20,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">know and then I go and print it to a</font>

799
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:23,790
badge so a lot of techniques like that

800
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:29,100
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can use in a way to mitigate</font>

801
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:32,610
that too is the RFID blocking sleeves

802
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:34,500
for badges they have some that prevent

803
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,790
that that way you take your card out and

804
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,040
use them and put it back in there that

805
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:42,600
way somebody can't you know grab your

806
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:46,500
your stuff I know do de military they

807
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:48,900
also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> their card holders that it's</font>

808
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,210
like a thick plastic so when it's closed

809
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,550
like this it won't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> but when they go</font>

810
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:55,200
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the badge reader they just squeeze</font>

811
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,610
it open and it separates<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

812
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,200
they're bad works and then it's let go

813
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:02,090
of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it closes again so there are</font>

814
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,089
many options to protect against that so

815
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:09,840
key RFID badges so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is tim's and I</font>

816
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,990
get apologize for having to read because

817
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:17,250
you know he's so familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this that</font>

818
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:20,069
I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of have to you know go over it</font>

819
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:22,950
again let's see so he got into a

820
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:27,660
facility I got into several sensitive

821
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:31,439
areas plugged in malicious devices stole

822
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:34,230
a bunch of one day badges so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one</font>

823
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,330
that that he and i were there were three

824
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:37,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">of us</font>

825
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:39,860
and on these physical things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I always i</font>

826
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:42,140
recommend to always have at least two

827
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:45,260
people if you're going in alone it's a

828
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:48,190
lot harder to do things because let's

829
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:50,630
say if if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about to get caught or</font>

830
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:52,970
that there's a security guard<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can go</font>

831
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:55,700
distract that<font color="#E5E5E5"> security guard and maybe</font>

832
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:57,890
get caught<font color="#CCCCCC"> on purpose and if there's one</font>

833
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:00,620
security guard for an entire building

834
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:03,049
with many entrances which is often the

835
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:04,910
case their whole physical security

836
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:08,030
program is being tied up because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

837
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:10,609
there being a distraction and so he is

838
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:13,430
usually off somewhere doing doing

839
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:16,490
something else so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i highly recommend</font>

840
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:21,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so basically this is one where so</font>

841
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:23,899
we got in and he ended up hanging it

842
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:25,730
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the security guard and we</font>

843
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:28,700
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> over there like yeah house you know</font>

844
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:29,840
how's the weather<font color="#CCCCCC"> been where you know</font>

845
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:33,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're from out of town but we're here</font>

846
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:36,500
doing whatever so long story short they

847
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:39,069
have a big folder of badges that they

848
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:42,380

849
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:44,360

the security guards the steep propped up

853
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,370
looking at the binder because he was

854
00:38:52,460 --> 00:39:00,020
doing badge inventory and so he's taking

855
00:38:55,370 --> 00:39:02,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so he's taking these badges out and</font>

856
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:05,660

857
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:07,340
badge<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he has his clipboard and he's</font>

858
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:09,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">sitting there he'll take the badge he's</font>

859
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:11,060
like rubbing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on the clipboard you</font>

860
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:12,980
know and it's making a lot of noise and

861
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:15,259
it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid why would you take out a</font>

862
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,460
badge and rub<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on your clipboard you</font>

868
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:31,790

874
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:44,209

875
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,850
which are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worthless</font>

876
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:49,160
unless you're trying to bump a lot but

877
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:50,868
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a key ring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think he has like 20</font>

878
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:53,420
keys on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mine</font>

882
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:03,140
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> them back so this was pretty funny</font>

883
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:04,700
so we we walked<font color="#CCCCCC"> in we had some guys that</font>

884
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:07,549
were pretty suspicious because we have

885
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:11,299
been there<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is our third time there</font>

886
00:40:07,549 --> 00:40:14,450
and over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course of a few years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

887
00:40:11,299 --> 00:40:17,299
so we knew there were some some

888
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:19,520
maintenance guys that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching us</font>

889
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:21,799
you know so we go downstairs where the

890
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,390
access control room is and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lights</font>

891
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:25,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">are off so there's nobody in there and</font>

892
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:29,058
so he opens the door and right woman the

893
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:30,439
open the door one of the security you're

894
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:32,690
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> security but the maintenance guys</font>

895
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,640
comes around the corner<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we close</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

896
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:37,579
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick and so then we run and we</font>

897
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,828
like jump under we like hide under the

898
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:42,230
desk and we can see the the window right

899
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:44,539
there sir we're hiding under there just

900
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:46,430
waiting for this guy to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and I</font>

901
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:48,740
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Tim what do we say if he comes</font>

902
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:53,390
in there and he's like a surprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

903
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:55,970
folks like I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like okay so fortunate</font>

904
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:58,250
for us the guy never never came<font color="#CCCCCC"> in to</font>

905
00:40:55,970 --> 00:41:00,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">look or anything so you know we we take</font>

906
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:03,410
two security guards keys we open the

907
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:06,079
access box for all the keys for all the

908
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:07,819
company vehicles server room and so

909
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:12,529
basically from then you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

910
00:41:07,819 --> 00:41:15,680
have been game<font color="#CCCCCC"> over but and the the</font>

911
00:41:12,529 --> 00:41:18,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason that talking about this stuff</font>

912
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,990
again is because there's a huge issue

913
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:24,259
with as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned if there's a company</font>

914
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:28,490
that has a gigantic<font color="#E5E5E5"> corporate building</font>

915
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:30,319
with multiple entrances where do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font>

916
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:33,950
the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> guards it's usually one</font>

917
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:37,788
maybe two at the receptionist desk right

918
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:40,759
so they come in okay here's your here's

919
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:43,880
your temporary pass or whatever and and

920
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:47,059
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually about it so if you can</font>

921
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,440
distract those guys or they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

922
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:51,319
watching the monitor and paying

923
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,750
attention like who's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know other than</font>

924
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:56,270
employees who's there right so it's

925
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:58,309
really important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'll get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to this</font>

926
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:00,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but security awareness and</font>

927
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:02,779
making that part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your culture to</font>

928
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:05,239
train the employees to say hey it's okay

929
00:42:02,779 --> 00:42:06,979
to go ask somebody a question and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

930
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:13,909
that they know who to escalate that too

931
00:42:06,979 --> 00:42:15,678
if there's an issue so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we grabbed a few</font>

932
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:16,819
other badges because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into a room</font>

933
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:19,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually made their own</font>

934
00:42:16,819 --> 00:42:21,829
employee badges there in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room so we</font>

935
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:24,979
we got in there with the under the door

936
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:27,109
tool and grabbed a bunch of badges think

937
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:28,848
we got like six or seven a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

938
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:32,659
were terminated employees that they

939
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:34,999
hadn't disabled the badge yet so we went

940
00:42:32,659 --> 00:42:37,429
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> location and I was</font>

941
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:39,109
wearing one it was an Indian employee

942
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:44,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I was walking around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with this</font>

943
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:44,469
badge and still no one said anything so

944
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:55,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this one this was another sweet and</font>

945
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,769
I I like the big buildings because

946
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:59,719
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can go after but</font>

947
00:42:57,769 --> 00:43:02,269
there's also a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of free space but</font>

948
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:05,630
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are tasked with going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into a</font>

949
00:43:02,269 --> 00:43:07,999
single suite with a single entry and

950
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:09,739
it's small and so they know everyone

951
00:43:07,999 --> 00:43:11,890
going in and out because they you know

952
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:15,829
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know if a face that is</font>

953
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:19,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">new so those are quite a bit of a</font>

954
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:22,849
challenge and so another co-worker and

955
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:27,979
myself were tasked with getting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

956
00:43:22,849 --> 00:43:29,569
place and realized he went up saying we

957
00:43:27,979 --> 00:43:31,968
found out who the vendor was that

958
00:43:29,569 --> 00:43:35,449
services their printers so he's a you

959
00:43:31,969 --> 00:43:38,209
know hey I'm here to pick up<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tool we</font>

960
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:40,309
service your printer yesterday and I

961
00:43:38,209 --> 00:43:42,589
left the screwdriver can I go grab it

962
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:45,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">and she knew right away something was up</font>

963
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:47,808
so she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'll escort you so he</font>

964
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:51,319
walks back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first printer he sees</font>

965
00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:53,390
and looks around like oh maybe it's in

966
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:55,069
the truck or something she's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like okay</font>

967
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:56,598
and come back with me to the front door

968
00:43:55,069 --> 00:43:58,609
you know it's like he wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

969
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:02,390
anywhere with this so we waited until

970
00:43:58,609 --> 00:44:03,769
after hours and we were like okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

971
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,419
just take the elevator with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the elevator</font>

972
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:08,058
didn't work unless you had a badge after

973
00:44:05,419 --> 00:44:10,640
hours so we got into the stairway and

974
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:13,609
made our way up and they had the the

975
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:16,279
cava style block which like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> for near</font>

976

978
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:26,270

979
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:28,670
common patterns that we know of and I'm

980

985
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:45,410

00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:50,540
monitor so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> in their cubicles</font>

988
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:52,670
you know seeing passwords and stuff

989
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:54,170
written on post-its hidden underneath

990
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:56,000
keyboards always look underneath

991
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:57,350
keyboards because people think Oh

992
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,820
nobody's ever going to look here I'm

993
00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:01,640
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write my password down because</font>

994
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:04,670
it's not on my screen it still just as

995
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:06,549
bad so don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so we were finding</font>

996
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:09,140
all these passwords we were getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

997
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:12,740
picking locks and getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into sensitive</font>

998
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:15,109
files it was financial data so we were

999
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:19,430
there for probably a good hour hour and

1000
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:21,830
a half just walking around and so we're

1001
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:25,390
like okay where's the security guard

1002
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:28,520
something's up so we go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1003
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:32,089
double blast doors which was there the

1004
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:37,820
main<font color="#E5E5E5"> entrance and I had a coat hanger</font>

1005
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:39,890
and I had some tissues and so there was

1006
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:42,140
a physical gap in the door and they had

1007
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:44,210
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> request to exit sensor on the other</font>

1008
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:46,670
side so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you're leaving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1009
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:50,180
building it picks up on your motion and

1010
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:52,160
it will unlock<font color="#CCCCCC"> the door for you so I get</font>

1011
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:54,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">this coat hanger and I'm sitting you're</font>

1012
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:57,710
tying is like Starbucks napkins or

1013
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:59,780
something like that just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see you know</font>

1014
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:02,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">what ridiculous thing can we open this</font>

1015
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:04,280
door with so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting here and I have</font>

1016
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:06,710
it tied and I'm sticking out of the door

1017
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:09,050
and the camera is<font color="#E5E5E5"> right behind me and</font>

1018
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:11,990
I'm looking at the camera with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1019
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:13,880
hanger going like this up and down the

1020
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:16,520
door with this stupid hanger with

1021
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:18,680
tissues tied to it it didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work i</font>

1022
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:20,590
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the angle the degree of this</font>

1023
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:24,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">sensor was too far out to pick it up</font>

1024
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:26,780
more like still no one is coming more

1025
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,279
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how stupid can we look now</font>

1026
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:30,200
like what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do to get their</font>

1027
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention so we are literally</font>

1028
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,819
doing jumping jacks at the camera like

1029
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:37,339
this and you know like doing stupid

1030
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:39,440
dance news which I won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do because I</font>

1031
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:43,578
can't dance<font color="#E5E5E5"> and their stupid dance moves</font>

1032
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:45,349
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy never came and so we reported</font>

1033
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:46,869
that to the clients like you know we

1034
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:49,670
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have just started hauling</font>

1035
00:46:46,869 --> 00:46:51,920
computers out the door we could have

1036
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:53,900
done whatever we wanted to no one was

1037
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,780
coming is like we literally did jumping

1038
00:46:53,900 --> 00:47:00,700
jacks in front of the camera and no one

1039
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:06,320
came so it was a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of concern because</font>

1040
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:09,290
companies put so much so much faith in a

1041
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:14,810
security guard to protect their physical

1042
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:16,400
security for you know everything I don't

1043
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:18,140
understand that I'm an ethic there's the

1044
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,210
maybe like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a false sense of security</font>

1045
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:24,770
like oh we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> security guards we're</font>

1046
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:26,630
good like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aria let me show you so how do</font>

1047
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:29,509
you fix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I mean there's you add more</font>

1048
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:33,530
security guards<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an option plan</font>

1049
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:35,359
expensive option but you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> train the</font>

1050
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:37,700
security guards a lot of times they come

1051
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:39,890
in from<font color="#CCCCCC"> different companies you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can have</font>

1052
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:41,868
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> do specific things for your company</font>

1053
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:44,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can you know set up different</font>

1054
00:47:41,869 --> 00:47:46,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">roles just make sure that they are</font>

1055
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:49,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">checking things like they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to</font>

1056
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:51,859
and that they know how to follow up so

1057
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:54,109
on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that security awareness</font>

1058
00:47:51,859 --> 00:47:56,619
training for the employees you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know do</font>

1059
00:47:54,109 --> 00:48:00,109
something beyond just a boring

1060
00:47:56,619 --> 00:48:01,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">PowerPoint or you know where you sit</font>

1061
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:03,290
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like 25 minutes you've got to</font>

1062
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:05,750
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> your yearly security awareness</font>

1063
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:07,670
training takes 25 minutes and you won't

1064
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember anything you read because you</font>

1065
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:10,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">just want to make sure you click the</font>

1066
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:13,160
right box so that you can get back to

1067
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:15,859
work that's not really very effective

1068
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:20,720
somewhat effective but usually it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1069
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:22,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">very effective so when we go and do</font>

1070
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,980
assessments like this then we show them

1071
00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:27,260
hey here's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> real world example of what</font>

1072
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:30,109
some you know malicious attacker

1073
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:33,319
malicious user can do with unauthorized

1074
00:48:30,109 --> 00:48:34,910
access but you guys are doing yearly

1075
00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:37,160
security awareness training let's figure

1076
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:39,470
out how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to switch it up how to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1077
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,868
part of the culture where you know try

1078
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:44,058
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get people excited about it and one</font>

1079
00:48:41,869 --> 00:48:48,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing I like to recommend is incentivize</font>

1080
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:50,299
so if have a person<font color="#CCCCCC"> that regularly goes</font>

1081
00:48:48,349 --> 00:48:52,789
in somewhere they're not supposed to and

1082
00:48:50,299 --> 00:48:54,079
see if an employee calls them out if

1083
00:48:52,789 --> 00:48:55,519
they do give them a gift card or

1084
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,559
something and then give them some

1085
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:59,629
recognition on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next team call or</font>

1086
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:03,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like hey it kudos to so-and-so</font>

1087
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:04,969
for catching our<font color="#CCCCCC"> red team guy that</font>

1088
00:49:03,499 --> 00:49:06,799
wasn't wearing his badge and wasn't

1089
00:49:04,969 --> 00:49:08,689
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be there and then you know</font>

1090
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:10,759
you can hopefully try to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1091
00:49:08,689 --> 00:49:13,189
something that's fun and more

1092
00:49:10,759 --> 00:49:19,339
interactive than just a you know a click

1093
00:49:13,189 --> 00:49:21,009
through a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tests when they just</font>

1094
00:49:19,339 --> 00:49:23,449
don't buy it like I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier</font>

1095
00:49:21,009 --> 00:49:26,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you get them the fake letter and</font>

1096
00:49:23,449 --> 00:49:29,809
they're like okay you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't work at the</font>

1097
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:32,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">White House you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even a</font>

1098
00:49:29,809 --> 00:49:35,719
real person on this thing you're coming

1099
00:49:32,749 --> 00:49:37,910

1100
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:39,859
you're like okay just let you know I'm

1101
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:43,729
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to comply with it you asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me to</font>

1102
00:49:39,859 --> 00:49:45,920
do here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real letter can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you please</font>

1103
00:49:43,729 --> 00:49:48,109
call the point of<font color="#CCCCCC"> contact on there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1104
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,269
sometimes you know once the adrenaline

1105
00:49:48,109 --> 00:49:53,029
have settled down then they start oh

1106
00:49:50,269 --> 00:49:55,609
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should call this number and they</font>

1107
00:49:53,029 --> 00:49:58,880
do or you say can I please make a phone

1108
00:49:55,609 --> 00:50:04,808
call so I can call your point of contact

1109
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:04,809
and have them you know do whatever yeah

1110
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:17,039
yeah well it's both because it's like

1111
00:50:14,509 --> 00:50:18,720
especially if it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> early on because</font>

1112
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:20,910
you're like oh man I you know I know I'm

1113
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,470
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this and this person gave me a</font>

1114
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:23,819
dirty look so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure i get</font>

1115
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:25,618
their credential you know something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1116
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:29,609
that which is awful it's not good to

1117
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:32,039
single anybody out but it happens so

1118
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:34,619
yeah it's it's kind of disappointing

1119
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:36,450
because that is a really fun part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1120
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:38,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">job but at the same time it's exciting</font>

1121
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:40,379
because hey that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome these guys</font>

1122
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:42,690
are actually doing what they're supposed

1123
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:46,049
to do that's why we're here in the first

1124
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:48,329
place not to embarrass anybody or make

1125
00:50:46,049 --> 00:50:50,849
people look bad we're there to help

1126
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:52,619
teach to improve their security posture

1127
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:55,799
and so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that happens</font>

1128
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:57,119
you know two things one<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah awesome</font>

1129
00:50:55,799 --> 00:50:59,250
that you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're supposed</font>

1130
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,720
to do to this is going to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1131
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:02,759
short report that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get</font>

1132
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:08,399
through quickly so it's less paperwork

1133
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:21,539
too so there's good in bed was there

1134
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:26,130
another yeah that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

1135
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:28,559
question and before you do that make

1136
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:30,869
sure you check<font color="#CCCCCC"> state laws because that's</font>

1137
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:34,589
a big thing you can't just record

1138
00:51:30,869 --> 00:51:36,869
someone camera audio you know without

1139
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:39,359
their consent and a lot of places are

1140
00:51:36,869 --> 00:51:42,210
like pencil places like Pennsylvania are

1141
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:44,910
super strict about that so always check

1142
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:46,680
and if it's a certain situation where it

1143
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:48,750
might be required<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the client</font>

1144
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:51,328
requests it make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get it in</font>

1145
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:53,160
writing and that it follows local laws

1146
00:51:51,329 --> 00:51:55,019
and it's not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh I think</font>

1147
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:58,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone is you know you don't turn into</font>

1148
00:51:55,019 --> 00:52:00,450
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> private investigator because that's a</font>

1149
00:51:58,019 --> 00:52:03,750
whole legal perspective you want to stay

1150
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:06,529
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of so yeah I'll avoid that we do</font>

1151
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:10,940
take pictures now we do take video

1152
00:52:06,529 --> 00:52:13,730
sometimes if we're bypassing something

1153
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:16,559
you know like when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do the can of the</font>

1154
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:18,539
compressed air<font color="#CCCCCC"> upside down and you know</font>

1155
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through and it trips to the</font>

1156
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:22,589
request to exit sensor if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1157
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,500
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a client or if they have a</font>

1158
00:52:22,589 --> 00:52:28,470
door so there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security room that has</font>

1159
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:31,500
had dimple locks that they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in</font>

1160
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:33,959
and they had the strike plate and a few

1161
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,540
other things and the biometric reader

1162
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:40,110
like oh yeah you you know good<font color="#E5E5E5"> luck and</font>

1163
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:46,320
we're like okay so i get a shove not

1164
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:47,910
they actually might have it with me so

1165
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,590
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is one of my physical</font>

1166
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:52,319
injury kits it's just some pieces<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

1167
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:54,990
put together so this little<font color="#CCCCCC"> shove knife</font>

1168
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:56,790
got me past like several hundred dollars

1169
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:58,470
worth of equipment and about five

1170
00:52:56,790 --> 00:53:01,020
seconds because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had the physical</font>

1171
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:02,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">gasps that they didn't consider and the</font>

1172
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:05,700
strike plate was installed incorrectly

1173
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:09,630
so without<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know trying to pick a</font>

1174
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:12,240
dimple lock which is awful or trying to

1175
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:15,030
bypass any of their<font color="#E5E5E5"> readers we just you</font>

1176
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:22,439
know click the door open and we were in

1177
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:25,050
so so yeah there are ways to do that was

1178
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:29,850
there another hand up I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going crazy</font>

1179
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:31,500
okay cool so yeah again when they're not

1180
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:34,980
buying it and you guys said just come

1181
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:39,750
clean comply and then eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1182
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:41,940
will work themselves out yep<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is off</font>

1183
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:45,870
you're going to watch it<font color="#CCCCCC"> over yeah bug</font>

1184
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:49,680
out exit strategy so yeah apologies for

1185
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:50,850
those weak weak stomachs and you're

1186
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,399
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just keep watching you're not</font>

1187
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:56,009
going to hear anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say from this</font>

1188
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:59,040
so revisit the scope so when you're

1189
00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:01,260
finished take some time and go back and

1190
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:04,470
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what were the main objectives</font>

1191
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:07,260
that the client requested did I attempt

1192
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:08,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">to achieve those if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not you know spend</font>

1193
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:13,500
some more time and go back and do what

1194
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:15,630
they ask notes anything like that like

1195
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,580
so we all the passwords of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

1196
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:19,470
saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> on post-its anything like that will</font>

1197
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:22,400
document take pictures of because you

1198
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:25,890
need something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show in the report</font>

1199
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,870
make sure you clean up so if if you do

1200
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:31,650
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a filing cabinet you get stuff</font>

1201
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:33,540
out or whatever it may be make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1202
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:36,000
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're finished documenting you put</font>

1203
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:38,460
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> back as close to possible as they</font>

1204
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,510
were before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> touch anything if you</font>

1205
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:41,130
can't let's say you get

1206
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:43,800
physical access to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Machine and you</font>

1207
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:45,780
get a reverse shell and you can't clean

1208
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">it up make sure you document that</font>

1209
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,080
machine and let the client know because

1210
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,360
you don't want you know the code for

1211
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:56,009
meterpreter shell just you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know hanging</font>

1212
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:57,870
around on the machine so just make notes

1213
00:54:56,010 --> 00:55:01,250
of things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you alter anything you</font>

1214
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:08,400
change make notes and let them know and

1215
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:10,050
then exit the building so and again

1216
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,900
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> you be concerned about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

1217
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:15,600
recorded or seen so if it's strictly a

1218
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:17,070
covert assessment and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're the whole</font>

1219
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:21,210
point is to get in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1220
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:22,590
without anyone noticing you keep that in

1221
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:24,360
mind to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know pay attention where</font>

1222
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:27,420
cameras are your techniques things like

1223
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,950
that and is there anything else that

1224
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:33,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">needs to be done before you leave as I</font>

1225
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:37,290
mentioned earlier and again I already

1226
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:38,730
talked about the annual training and you

1227
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:41,040
don't have to be paranoid all the time

1228
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:44,040
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like someone's out to get you</font>

1229
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,960
and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> steal your wallet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but maybe</font>

1230
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:48,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do maybe there's a healthy level of</font>

1231
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:52,080
that that's required you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1232
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:54,330
diligent and to to be aware so just

1233
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:57,480
stress that importance to your clients

1234
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:59,640
or to your customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry let them</font>

1235
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,940
know hey this is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy this stuff can</font>

1236
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:07,049
happen here's what you can do it's okay

1237
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:09,210
to go ask questions so what had we were

1238
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:13,650
doing a security awareness training in

1239
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:16,110
Washington and there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the main</font>

1240
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:17,910
guys there as we were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

1241
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:20,130
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and showing how easy it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

1242
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:21,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">in how easy it was to get in their</font>

1243
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:23,640
building because we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and then we</font>

1244
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:26,220
use that for their security awareness

1245
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:28,470
training for them to say okay this is

1246
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:31,230
why it matters here's an example in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1247
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:33,359
building the guy literally literally

1248
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:35,700
raised his hand and said so if I see

1249
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:37,020
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm not sure if they're</font>

1250
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:40,080
supposed to be here I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to</font>

1251
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:42,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">go ask them and I was like yeah you go</font>

1252
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:46,110
ask them<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you do are you can I</font>

1253
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:48,120
see your badge I don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a badge okay</font>

1254
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:50,010
well then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to come with me they</font>

1255
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:52,470
need to know who to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> or where to</font>

1256
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:53,349
take that person so make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

1257
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:55,868
measures are

1258
00:56:53,349 --> 00:56:57,190
place and just let them know that even

1259
00:56:55,869 --> 00:56:59,529
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not a confrontational person</font>

1260
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:03,009
most people hate confrontation they'll

1261
00:56:59,529 --> 00:57:06,339
avoid it at all measure it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1262
00:57:03,009 --> 00:57:10,390
you know for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sake</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of security to ask</font>

1263
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:11,670
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question it's not you know most of</font>

1264
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:15,220
time you're not going to get some

1265
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:20,950
ridiculous response from someone just

1266
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:23,470
from asking them a question yeah hackers

1267
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:25,509
don't care how hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network is if</font>

1268
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:28,359
they can just walk in and plug in and

1269
00:57:25,509 --> 00:57:30,339
gain passwords it's game over so that's

1270
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:33,940
why this physical stuff is just as

1271
00:57:30,339 --> 00:57:35,140
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninnum of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slime</font>

1272
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:38,109
configurations<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go through this</font>

1273
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:40,479
stuff real quick a few things are can

1274
00:57:38,109 --> 00:57:42,819
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug in USB either like the microSD</font>

1275
00:57:40,479 --> 00:57:46,029
cards to execute payloads if someone has

1276
00:57:42,819 --> 00:57:51,700
physical access do you need that enabled

1277
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:53,619
if not disable it sensitive data should

1278
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:56,529
always be put away again don't write

1279
00:57:53,619 --> 00:57:58,599
passwords and stuff stick them on your

1280
00:57:56,529 --> 00:58:00,130
desk if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you print out something from the</font>

1281
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:01,569
printer make sure you're getting it or

1282
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:03,999
when you're done with things make sure

1283
00:58:01,569 --> 00:58:06,940
they're locked properly or shredded if

1284
00:58:03,999 --> 00:58:10,089
no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know</font>

1285
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:15,579
proper procedures that should be made

1286
00:58:10,089 --> 00:58:18,249
just commonplace security vendors like I

1287
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:20,229
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can tailor what they do just</font>

1288
00:58:18,249 --> 00:58:24,308
let them know these are our main risks

1289
00:58:20,229 --> 00:58:25,779
no one gets in this room whoever is

1290
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:27,369
attempting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this room if they</font>

1291
00:58:25,779 --> 00:58:33,279
don't obviously have access or they're

1292
00:58:27,369 --> 00:58:35,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">not familiar approach them and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> verify so</font>

1293
00:58:33,279 --> 00:58:37,180
they often make a huge difference in

1294
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:39,460
your physical security and as I

1295
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:43,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned they usually are the physical</font>

1296
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:46,690
security program and again that the

1297
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:48,460
importance has to be stressed on what

1298
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:52,269
their purpose is there and how much

1299
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:55,690
rests on their shoulders require<font color="#CCCCCC"> Badgers</font>

1300
00:58:52,269 --> 00:58:57,098
to be visible<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all times employees</font>

1301
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:59,529
need to understand security starts with

1302
00:58:57,099 --> 00:59:01,930
them you shouldn't put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all on the</font>

1303
00:58:59,529 --> 00:59:04,809
security guards unless you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> several</font>

1304
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:07,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">security guards at patrolling the place</font>

1305
00:59:04,809 --> 00:59:10,240
if that's even in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> budget</font>

1306
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:12,550
so destruction and shredder bin should

1307
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:14,529
always be secure with a real lock not a

1308
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:16,350
master lock because you know you can

1309
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:19,650
look at one of those and they pop open

1310
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:25,870
so if it's something that is important

1311
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:27,580
spend the money on a good walk and it

1312
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:30,970
doesn't matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great your electronic</font>

1313
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:34,960
controls are if you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just bypass so</font>

1314
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:41,560
you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a</font>

1315
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:43,150
gate so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah use common sense when</font>

1316
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're installing these things like the</font>

1317
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:46,570
strike plate i mentioned earlier that we

1318
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:48,670
bypass make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that they're being</font>

1319
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:49,930
installed properly if your maintenance

1320
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:52,990
people aren't familiar with that

1321
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:54,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology that technology hire someone</font>

1322
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:59,529
to come train them or install it for you

1323
00:59:54,970 --> 01:00:01,000
so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's basically the talk went</font>

1324
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:15,670
over a lot of stuff and I think we're

1325
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:16,240
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time but yet mmhmm yeah and it</font>

1326
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:19,030
depends

1327
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:21,279
one we went to a place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there with a</font>

1328
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:22,870

1339
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:51,730

1340
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:53,290
depends on the individual so it's uh but

1341
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:56,050
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> it comes down to basic things</font>

like know what you're talking about gain

1343
