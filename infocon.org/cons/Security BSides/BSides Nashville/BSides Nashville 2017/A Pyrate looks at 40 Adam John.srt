187
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:24,649
I didn't really realize I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did a huge</font>

188
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:29,209
massive breakdown I had well not mental

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,940
secondary well I was sure she<font color="#CCCCCC"> air</font>

199
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">another day centre that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fine that</font>

200
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,630
didn't work because global catalog

201
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,780
couldn't replicate because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> acting</font>

202
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:07,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">director issue that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't cleanly do</font>

203
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,170
and I actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> still remember a dear</font>

204
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,490
friend of mine named Chris when I was

205
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:15,189
doing he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

206
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:18,230
do that it's fine what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen</font>

207
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,580
and so you know in post mortem I

208
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,990
realized what happened my management was

209
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:27,080
actually very supportive because as a

210
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:32,180
person goes back up and after 23 hour

211
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:34,100
day and but they're like let's take you

213
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:40,340
because the world is not only<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ology</font>

00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:55,050
of view but you know they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

466
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,140
have it and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just an issue I'm</font>

00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:31,830
and actually do message up for you like

474
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:34,230
fortify actually becomes more less a

475
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:37,679
real when a fortified wave doesn't do

476
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:38,940
mobile web but you know web applications

477

more you know actually on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a server side</font>

481
