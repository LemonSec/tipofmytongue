00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:45,460
time and I lived in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> super shitty house</font>

342
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:47,289
through the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nowhere</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in Ohio</font>

343
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:51,700
now I live in a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> house in the</font>

344
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:53,799
middle of nowhere Ohio and I realized

345
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,789
for the first time something<font color="#E5E5E5"> was wrong</font>

346
00:17:53,799 --> 00:18:00,580
with me something more than the obvious

347
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:04,450
I was progressively getting sadder and

348
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:06,639
sadder throughout the day and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

349
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,179
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> shower and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just recently gotten</font>

350
00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:11,570
out getting ready for bed at night

351
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:13,759
and I like broke down started bawling my

352
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,289
eyes out on the floor of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bathroom my</font>

353
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,749
husband ran in he thought something was

354
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:19,970
super wrong that like I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaving him</font>

355
00:18:17,749 --> 00:18:23,720
or if I dying or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> yell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> super</font>

356
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:25,549
serious about a half an hour later I was

357
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:30,019
finally calmed down enough to actually

358
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:32,059
speak this gift is probably the best

359
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:35,769
representation I can give of how I was

360
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:38,360
feeling on the inside I mindless static

361
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:44,330
it's physically hurt to try and speak

362
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:45,678
and this is exactly how I felt I don't

363
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:50,809
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the word triggered and what</font>

364
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:52,159
some making fun of people but I can tell

365
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:54,350
you the thing that tipped me over the

366
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:57,860
edge or triggered me was that my shower

367
00:18:54,350 --> 00:19:00,049
curtain was dirty now I felt so

368
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,189
incredibly stupid and immature because

369
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:03,590
that's not something that you should

370
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:08,539
break down and hit like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a like a</font>

371
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:10,580
physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> breakdown about right so</font>

374
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:19,009
to cleanliness right I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have much</font>

375
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:21,019
control you know not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into too much</font>

376
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:22,549
personal detail but I didn't have much

377
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:27,230
control over the things that are

378
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:29,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening in my life and even when I</font>

379
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,190
realized something<font color="#CCCCCC"> was wrong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't</font>

381
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:38,419
and I figured you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know at the ripe age</font>

382
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:44,029
of 25 I had been through so much I could

392
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,918
conferences or whatever I realized that

393
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:11,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of people and then suspects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seem</font>

394
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,409
to struggle with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same kind of things</font>

395
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:14,409
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't like to talk about it</font>

396
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,970
and not only that you're struggling<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

397
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,439
it but you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know tackle</font>

398
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:25,490
everything on your own like I did for a

399
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,020
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or so it's my goal to try</font>

400
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,540
and make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as public as possible and</font>

401
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,830
without stigma to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

402
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:38,299
whoever about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it whether it be a</font>

403
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:39,678
professional or one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we</font>

404
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:42,170
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to admit anything wrong with</font>

405
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:46,970
us what's the first step of almost any

406
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:50,480
12-step program yeah admit you have a

407
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,620
problem acceptance right but not only do

408
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,510
you have to admit<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have a</font>

409
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,620
problem you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> admit to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself</font>

410
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:58,400
that you need to do something about it

411
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,600
otherwise you're not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get any</font>

412
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,910
further you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to spiral</font>

413
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:07,459
deeper down into whatever problems that

414
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:09,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're currently having so not only do</font>

421
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:30,290
are here because you have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> his boy</font>

422
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:32,690
would that stop the insults I community

423
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:35,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">is different than you know any other</font>

424
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:40,220
you're you're driven passionate

425
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:43,820
opinionated and and when you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

426
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:45,559
that together with you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> even with</font>

427
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,450
some of the professions that we do like

428
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:50,059
incident response or when you're dealing

429
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:52,340
with child trafficking you know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

430
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,540
the professions that are out there have

431
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,270
to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a lot of these sensitive</font>

432
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:58,220
subjects that tack on extra extra stress

433
00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:04,250
from all the other normal stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

434
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:06,650
we do it also makes it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

435
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:08,390
professions that we're in we're driven

436
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,309
to those because we have the ability to

437
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:13,280
stand or sit behind a keyboard for hours

438
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:14,360
on end without any human interaction so

439
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font>

440
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,639
research I was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

441
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,130
several months I've read a lot of

442
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,830
medical journals that were probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

443
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:26,960
over my head but I learned a lot of

444
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:30,939
really interesting stuff

445
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,529
so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started searching</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for you know</font>

446
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:35,690
stuff to talk about first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font>

447
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:38,779
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I googled mental health issues and</font>

448
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:40,610
STEM fields and there were six million

449
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:44,779
articles that came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up on Google four</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">million had to do with women but seventy</font>

00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:54,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little interesting I</font>

know the sexes are different when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

456
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:05,830
or depression while men go towards like

457
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:05,830
substance abuse or antisocial disorders

458
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:12,860
the hypothesis I was trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prove is</font>

459
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,689
that or try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> find somebody else that</font>

460
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:18,289
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually done the scientific</font>

461
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:21,669
research to prove is that it seemed like

462
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:25,990
people in STEM fields had a higher

463
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:29,000
tendency to have mental health problems

464
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:30,380
you know if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> back in bachelor</font>

465
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,820
history there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of</font>

466
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:37,909
extremely smart extremely creative

467
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:41,240
people that struggle a lot with a range

468
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:43,789
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mental health problems one that I</font>

469
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,070
found was a Savannah IQ interaction

470
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:48,529
hypothesis and it talks about two things

471
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:52,129
one thing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first thing I talked about</font>

472
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:53,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">was that the higher intelligence that</font>

473
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,000
you have the more likely are to be

474
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:58,429
either bipolar or depressed so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

475
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,890
the honorees quote from the huge long

476
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:04,730
medical paper some scenery of a couple

477
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:07,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">sentences the finding of an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> association</font>

478
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:09,590
between progressively increasing risk of

479
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:11,090
bipolar disorder and higher arithmetic

480
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:14,209
intellectual performance is rather

481
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:16,520
surprising explained that the arithmetic

482
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,470
test requires not only mathematical

483
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,480
skill but rapid information processing

484
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:23,299
for the purpose of successfully

485
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,190
completing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> timed exam high scorers</font>

486
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:27,168
with such rapid processing power may

487
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:30,620
also share tendency to experience mania

488
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:33,260
which is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the halves of manic</font>

489
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:37,178
depression which is a state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of high</font>

490
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:37,179
focus and high cycle motor activity

491
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:46,678
that the second part of that hypothesis

492
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:49,049
talks about how people of higher

493
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:53,820
intelligence are more likely to

494
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:56,850
self-medicate and they they did a lot of

495
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,439
scientific<font color="#CCCCCC"> research and let back you</font>

496
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,488
know through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> years looking at</font>

497
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:04,499
different things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know with</font>

498
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:06,720
medicating with foods prescription drugs

499
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:09,570
non prescription drugs that kind of

500
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:13,169
stuff it<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of shows you how I leave</font>

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> watch mr. robot all right good if</font>

502

you haven't I'm not going to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

503
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:20,159
any spoilers but it shows how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

504
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:21,960
research that they kind of put in to

505
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:26,539
that show because the main character

506
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:32,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">Elliot self-prescribed a lot he takes a</font>

507
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:35,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">Pacific set of specific mom measurement</font>

508
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:38,789
of morphine and then like counteracts it

509
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:41,330
with suboxone and and does his own well

510
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:43,259
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't recommend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing any of that</font>

511
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:45,539
that's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's what they do in</font>

512
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:49,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">the TV show and that's a good that's a</font>

513
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:53,059
good gist of at least half of that paper

514
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:55,889
so let's move on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some more statistics</font>

515
00:25:53,059 --> 00:26:01,499
not only does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this of an IQ interaction</font>

516
00:25:55,889 --> 00:26:03,149
hypothesis talking that's me like I'll

517
00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:08,179
order another beer just to pick off

518
00:26:03,149 --> 00:26:11,758
morally both the University<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Berkeley</font>

519
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:13,619
did a study that showed that 42 to 48

520
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,869
percent of stem graduates suffer from

521
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:19,039
depression that's compared to seven

522
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:19,039
percent of the rest of the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font>

523
00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:27,238
this makes sense when you look at the

524
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:32,249
google results not that you guys aren't

525
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:34,379
having problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you you</font>

526
00:26:32,249 --> 00:26:35,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">just you just aren't talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about them</font>

527
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:40,619
or you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not talking you're not getting</font>

00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:45,450

us right if you look around and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we think</font>

rocking it they're super happy all the

544
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:34,620
time but that might not know that that

545
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:38,360
might not necessarily be true this is

546
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:41,969
definitely me I'm one of the one in 25

547
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:46,039
that's that's had some some part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

548

inner self completely screw up a major

00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:54,360
activity in my life<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found that the US</font>

Preventive Services Task Force

554
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:08,370
thought all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right well the US</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

555
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:10,889
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling us that and all right</font>

556
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:13,500
so is it just everybody in the US should

557
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:14,939
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> screened like why is it just white</font>

558
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,669
why do they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we all need</font>

559
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:20,220
screen is it is it our diet is that our

560
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:24,870
government is it you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it is</font>

561
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:28,019
that I mean in the grand scheme of

562
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:30,090
things we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good right other</font>

do that you might avoid normal social

618

social situations like using a public

back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like what they considered their</font>

or at home or whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> on e making eye</font>

629
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:13,710
contact initiating conversations dating

630
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:18,300
dating is really fun when you have

631
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:20,570
anxiety attending parties their social

632
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,470
gathering going to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> or school</font>

633
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:27,720
entering a room where people are already

634
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:29,160
seated returning items to store so I

635
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,770
don't know how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationships are</font>

636
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,600
ruined because of anxiety and not just

00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,670
romantic relationships right but like

638
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,070
friendships or anything that's above

639
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:44,070
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a business circling and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Aram a</font>

640
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:47,220
relationship I over invest myself I will

641
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:49,020
overthink things I'll push people away

642
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:53,430
because in my mind I<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like they're</font>

643
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:56,129
already gone I'm being too needy I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

644

00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:09,300
but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't make any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difference it's</font>

649
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:10,560
still there and that's a that's a common

650
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:14,490
theme for people with anxiety is

651
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:17,100
overthinking and being around people so

<font color="#E5E5E5">it is to get a good sample of people</font>

853
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,960
answering survey questions I still

854
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:58,190
wanted to put it out there just to see

855
00:41:53,960 --> 00:42:00,070
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could come up with this was one</font>

856
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:03,580
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the questions that I thought the</font>

857
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:05,540
responses were interesting on the

858
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:07,549
several people pointed out the fact that

859
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:11,180
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of messed up the question format</font>

860
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:13,010
because I had asked see what it was do

861
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,810
you participate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> any activities to</font>

862
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:16,820
reduce doll or improve the stress or

863
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:19,940
feelings you're having such as alcohol

864
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:25,730
prescription drugs other<font color="#E5E5E5"> drugs exercise</font>

865
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:28,130
meditation or other I had put it out

866
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:29,510
there as a multiple choice question when

867
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:32,660
it should have been a multiple answer

868
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:35,360
question because when you cope you might

869
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,950
do more than one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things and</font>

870
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:40,040
that was definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case a lot of</font>

871
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:44,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">people put in the other category all all</font>

872
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:46,160
of the above and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

873
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:49,000
represented here that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely more</font>

874
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:51,799
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the total amount here I</font>

875
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:56,770
think my favorite out of the other

876
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,770
category were pretend to be a Vulcan

879
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:15,229
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different coping mechanisms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

880
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:16,340
can deal with and I think ninety percent

881
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:19,250
of the people that answered the survey

882
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:22,580
were in infosec or some related branch

883
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:24,500
of IT and you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sevilla IQ</font>

884
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:28,000
hypothesis working here there's a lot of

00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:31,280
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> using drugs and alcohol to cope I</font>

everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font>

891
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:41,270
to kind of give him an idea of where I

892
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:41,819
wanted to go and see if he could give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

any good feed

895
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:48,779
is that there are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that you</font>

896
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:54,509
can do to majorly improve the chemicals

900
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:13,170

901
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:16,920
medical mental health professional he

902
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:20,130
said that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> he told the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> patients so</font>

903
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,449
I used my mom as a sounding board for a

904
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,829
lot of research that I do a lot of the

and tired and withdrawn behavior and at

915
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:50,489
the time they committed her and started

916
00:44:48,509 --> 00:44:52,380
giving her shock treatments because

917
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:53,819

Museum and there they had and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

924
00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:20,369
call it an insane asylum but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was it</font>

925
00:45:18,269 --> 00:45:23,549
was basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a huge halfway house</font>

926
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:26,249
that you know if you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have money</font>

927
00:45:23,549 --> 00:45:29,369
to go to a nursing home or you didn't

928
00:45:26,249 --> 00:45:31,410
have parents or you were really sick or

929
00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:33,809
poor everybody would just go here this

930
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:35,339
huge farm and you would work on it a lot

931
00:45:33,809 --> 00:45:38,160
of times they had mentally insane people

932
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:40,349
there and they would send them to like

933
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:44,930
this building that was just locked down

934
00:45:40,349 --> 00:45:47,160
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> overlooked this nice hog pen and</font>

935
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:48,649
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> they go with it right there</font>

936
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:52,190
was no other ways that

937
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:54,140
that they let them cope there was a sign

938
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:55,579
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> building it was a quote from one</font>

939
00:45:54,140 --> 00:46:00,379
of the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that used to work there is</font>

940
00:45:55,579 --> 00:46:02,960
like Anna during roar one something

941
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:05,599
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> they let the crazies out to play</font>

942
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:09,319
today and it made<font color="#E5E5E5"> a marked improvement</font>

943
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,910
on their general well-being and just the

944
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:13,849
way that they talked about was really

945
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:16,879
super interesting so now we have way

946
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:18,349
better ways of coping right people talk

947
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,609
about safe spaces when they make<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun of</font>

948
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:24,260
Millennials but we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need we don't</font>

949
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:25,308
really need safe spaces right there are

950
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:29,089
a couple people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do but they're</font>

951
00:46:25,309 --> 00:46:31,039
probably created on the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us but</font>

952
00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:33,410
it's nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go somewhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can</font>

953
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:35,240
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to somebody openly about what</font>

954
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:39,470
you're experiencing or what you're doing

955
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:41,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">day to day and not have them judge you</font>

956
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,939
back right or<font color="#E5E5E5"> spread the rumors or</font>

957
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:46,970
whatever it can feel really good to

958
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:48,559
externalize your feelings a lot of the

959
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,808
coping that I did without knowing it was

960
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,880
coping when I was younger was right I

961
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:55,730
would either write down what was on my

962
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:58,029
mind or I would write stories or I would

963
00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:00,890
just write anything and it was really

964
00:46:58,029 --> 00:47:02,329
therapeutic and it would help me<font color="#E5E5E5"> cope</font>

965
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:08,029
without even knowing that's what I was

966
00:47:02,329 --> 00:47:11,270
doing so back yeah so back then you

967
00:47:08,029 --> 00:47:14,270
couldn't really talk about mental health

968
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:15,859
issues it was really taboo just like you

969
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:19,849
couldn't you couldn't talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mental</font>

970
00:47:15,859 --> 00:47:24,319
health divorce teen pregnancy I've had

971
00:47:19,849 --> 00:47:25,700
all three and it's not it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as taboo</font>

972
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:30,950
to talk about anymore you can ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

973
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:32,839
help through<font color="#CCCCCC"> psychologists therapists</font>

974
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:34,549
whatever and something else that I

975
00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:36,740
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is if you do happen</font>

976
00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:38,690
to be interested or want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to a</font>

977

00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:47,630
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> people throughout this whole</font>

980
00:47:43,279 --> 00:47:48,980
thing that will find the therapist but

981
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:50,960
they don't like talking to they don't

982

985
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:01,180
which is great especially for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

986
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:01,180
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like to go to the house</font>

the use of antidepressants and it's an

estimated one in 10 adults now taking

00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:20,840
them so I don't want to don't ever want

993
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:22,730
to devalue anybody suffering but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

also don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to throw medication at</font>

995
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:25,700
something where you might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,260

your life so the event one of the things

999
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:35,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we talked about increase your</font>

1000
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,760
dopamine levels by you know

participating in the activity<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

naturally not without<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking any</font>

1003
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:45,950
medication so when I was prescribed a

1004
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:49,160
medication for the first time I talked

1005
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:50,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">to my doctor i was given zoloft and this</font>

1006
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:53,960
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the explanation that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he had</font>

1007
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,250
given me that it's a simple it's a

simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> chemical imbalance in my brain</font>

that we could interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> interact and</font>

1010
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:02,660
correct with this simple chemical you

1011
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:05,720
should take a pill every day which in my

1012
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:07,970
mind made complete sense you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's</font>

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just something chemical that</font>

they're interacting with with another

1015
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:14,090
chemical and everything would be fine if

1016
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:15,590
I took it so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found out throughout my</font>

00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:18,740
research<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's not necessarily a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">these medications work and I understand</font>

1021
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:29,990
science is hard studies also pointed out

1022
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,230
that issues arise not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only from the</font>

00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:36,529
chemical imbalances in the brain but

you're taking causing it like as a side

1028

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this they said we did not dispute</font>

1031
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:58,550
the possibility that neurotransmitters

00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:00,529
and other brain chemicals play

1033
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:03,320
significant role on the ideology of

1034
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:05,180
depression however<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're also concerned</font>

that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chemical chemical</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> imbalance</font>

1038
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:12,640
maybe given greater crayons by both

1039
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:15,040
consumers and practitioners and

1040
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,359
supported by some research and or may be

1041
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:20,080
understood in an overly simplistic

1042
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:22,120
manner but really what what kind of

1043
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:24,400
medical knowledge unless you're in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1044
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:27,130
medical field do we get that isn't in an

1045
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:30,130
overly simplistic manner I really think

1046
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:33,400
it's a way for the doctors to to explain

1047
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:34,600
it without saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't know because</font>

1048
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:38,890
you don't ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to hear that when</font>

1049
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:40,660
you go into the doctor I started taking

1050
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:43,569
zoloft about six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the end</font>

1051
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:48,009
of my divorce and or the end of my

1052
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:50,710
marriage I adore took way longer and it

1053
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:54,100
was great I wasn't sad anymore I had a

1054
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:57,700
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of energy and it kind of also</font>

1055
00:50:54,100 --> 00:51:00,040
made me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a zombie now medication works</font>

1056
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:01,569
differently for everybody just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1057
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,310
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chemicals on the</font>

1058
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:04,300
different genetics that you have and

1059
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,940
everything going on in your life

1060
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:09,220
everything works with somebody a

1061
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:10,510
different way so one<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know zoloft</font>

1062
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:14,350
didn't work for me it might for somebody

1063
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:17,620
else that kind of thing but it made it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1064
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:19,450
stayed on it for a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years it made</font>

1065
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:22,690
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy to propel myself through</font>

1066
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:25,540
all of that the really stressful and

1067
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:27,910
tough times of my life all in all in six

1068
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:33,130
months I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> divorced a new job</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

1069
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:37,420
moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> with three kids so not having</font>

1070
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:39,550
emotions was great if any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've ever</font>

1071
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:42,850
watched The Magicians there's an episode

1072
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:44,320
that they use a spell to take all the

1073
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:51,220
emotions out so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make sounder</font>

1074
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:52,960
decisions pretty much like so after

1075
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:55,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">those major stresses in my life had that</font>

1076
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,870
died down I realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1077
00:51:55,030 --> 00:52:02,790
better if I started feeling some emotion

1078
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:05,680
again so I talked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my doctor again and</font>

1079
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:07,660
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also threw a bit of</font>

1080
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,370
self-reflection realized that I might

1081
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:11,799
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been going down the same path just</font>

1082
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:13,990
in a different way and I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> filming my</font>

1083
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:16,870
you know that hole in my life with way

1084
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:18,770
on healthier things so I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1085
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:21,259
the doctor and talked to him and

1086
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:24,620
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm on wellbutrin was the occasional</font>

1087
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:26,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">xanax when I start freaking out I'm not</font>

1088
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:27,529
saying everybody should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> medicated but</font>

1089
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:30,920
I'm pretty sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a lot of people</font>

1090
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:41,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that cope and weigh on healthier ways so</font>

1091
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:42,500
medication<font color="#CCCCCC"> is definitely an option so</font>

1092
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:45,080
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've covered a bunch of my</font>

1093
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:47,870
personal baggage we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about how</font>

1094
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:49,819
we help others on how we treat others

1095
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:55,670
that might be in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> lives that struggle</font>

1096
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:57,200
with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stuff I try and talk</font>

1097
00:52:55,670 --> 00:53:00,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the stuff as openly as possible</font>

1098
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:02,330
because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care like I don't mind</font>

1099
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:08,000
talking with it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> helping anybody that</font>

1100
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:10,190
I can and when I have an anxiety attack

1101
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,880
now I can verbalize it more than I used

1102
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:15,470
to be able to the two most common things

1103
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've heard kind of negative things</font>

talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get this or they'll get the</font>

1108
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:33,560
response that it's their fault I get

1109
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:36,859
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot and truly I so much going for</font>

1110
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:39,140
me I'm a published author I have you

00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:46,359
employed I'm fairly healthy like what

1113
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:48,950
right do I have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be depressed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever but</font>

1114
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:50,990
you know what hearing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I've</font>

1115
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:52,669
caught myself saying that to other

1116
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:53,810
people too you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if they open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up to</font>

1117
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,460
me about how they're feeling I'll say

1118
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:58,310
both ever but we love<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you're great</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody loves you well that's not it's</font>

1120
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:04,700
not bad to hear it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily</font>

1121
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:08,149
help or 2 i'll get maybe try singing

1122
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:11,629
happier thoughts I only wish that was

1123
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:13,340
possible you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just will yourself to</font>

1124
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:16,460
be better if you have a chemical

1125
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:19,130
imbalance<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be really easy to put a</font>

1126
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:22,210
happy face on on the outside but that's

1127
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:24,800
not changing anything on the inside a

1128
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:26,720
good majority of mental<font color="#CCCCCC"> health issues</font>

1129
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,590
come with those physical symptoms and if

1130
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,730
we treated them like physical symptoms I

1131
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:34,820
think we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> further in life</font>

1132
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:38,330
a lot of times we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even see that</font>

1133
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:42,080
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff ourselves we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some you</font>

1134
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:44,569
know good support system so let's cover

1135
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:47,240
the dues days first sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font>

1136
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:50,950
have to listen it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> no more than</font>

1137
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,950
that listening and good communication I

1138
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:58,940
you know talk having signals right so i

1139
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:04,070
have a subset of people that I can talk

1140
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:06,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">to or you know give them a signal if I'm</font>

1141
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:08,330
struggling right it's like you can use a

1142
00:55:06,619 --> 00:55:12,619
safe word for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your mental health i</font>

1143
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:17,200
leased a pineapple or whatever right and

1144
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:20,540
they'll know what to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help me um</font>

1145
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:23,529
might happen a lot of conferences but

1146
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:25,810
towards the end so it's not now sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1147
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:29,770
personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a combination of</font>

1148
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:33,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">traveling you know I work I work at home</font>

1149
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:34,970
alone all day long every day I have

1150
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:38,600
really no interaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> with people and</font>

1151
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:41,299
then you're thrown into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> three day</font>

1152
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,650
conference with you know a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font>

1153
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:45,080
hundred a couple hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand</font>

1154
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:49,930
whatever people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's a that's a</font>

1155
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:52,850
huge shock right the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of brain and</font>

1156
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:54,080
mixed with lack of sleep because you

1157
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:58,520
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the party all night sleep a couple</font>

1158
00:55:54,080 --> 00:56:02,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">hours and then repeat bad diet a lot of</font>

1159
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:03,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">times before I would forget to take my</font>

1160
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:06,800
medicine<font color="#E5E5E5"> and forget to take my vitamins</font>

1161
00:56:03,859 --> 00:56:08,029
and not exercise when I travel and I

1162
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:11,930
don't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mistake anymore I</font>

1163
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:13,369
sometimes skip the exercising and you

1164
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:16,399
know trade that off for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

1165
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:19,130
more sleep but I no longer forget to

1166
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:21,109
take my vitamins my medication because

1167
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:25,670
that just makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen so much</font>

1168
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:27,470
quicker secondly another thing you have

1169
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:30,619
to understand is that interacting with

1170
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:33,500
others is difficult and they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1171
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:36,550
not feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like going out the thought of</font>

1172
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:38,930
crowds in closed spaces dirty restrooms

1173
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:43,100
loud noise whatever the case may be

1174
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:45,589
whatever they're struggling with it is

1175
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:47,910
difficult to even fathom sometimes

1176
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:50,460
being crazy takes a huge toll on your

1177
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:52,560
social<font color="#E5E5E5"> life and sometimes there's</font>

1178
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:55,280
nothing you can do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help but having</font>

1179
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:57,750
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> open communication with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them and</font>

1180
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:02,280
knowing what to do when you can help

1181
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:04,080
really makes a difference there's a

1182
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:08,400
great article that a friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine sent</font>

1183
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:10,920
me we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about his anxiety</font>

1184
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,180
problems that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was dealing with and</font>

1185
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,070
it's called this is how you love someone

1186
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:17,549
thing this is how you love someone with

1187
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:19,380
anxiety a lot of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> points were spot on</font>

1188
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:21,380
but like in different ways for each of

1189
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:24,980
us because we both have different

1190
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:28,380
different ways of it affects our lives

1191
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:30,330
my favorite quote was silence kills

1192
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:32,490
anyone with anxiety it creates problems

1193
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:33,779
in our mind that<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even there it</font>

1194
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:36,240
ends<font color="#CCCCCC"> an apology's that aren't even</font>

1195
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:39,590
needed and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> part pretty much</font>

1196
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:42,029
describes me to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tee they talk about</font>

1197
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:44,550
texting like if you if you text the

1198
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:45,750
person and<font color="#E5E5E5"> earth you know somebody text</font>

1199
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:47,160
me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they they don't respond</font>

1200
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:48,630
especially like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've recently opened</font>

1201
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:53,279
up about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something as opposed to just</font>

1202
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:55,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">sending memes you know the thoughts just</font>

1203
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">spiral and the denied at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the time you</font>

1204
00:57:55,230 --> 00:58:01,109
realize that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all logical just like</font>

1205
00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:03,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with OCD in the</font>

1206
00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:04,980
studies and observing them they realize

1207
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:06,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that none of it was logical and none of</font>

1208
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:09,180
it was it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not based on any fact</font>

1209
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:15,420
whatsoever they knew it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was stupid but</font>

1210
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:17,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">it doesn't matter it still happens and</font>

1211
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:19,560
the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the the phrase it's</font>

1212
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:21,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay or asking how i can help can never</font>

1213
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:27,180
be used enough and nothing beats<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1214
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:28,680
blanket fort not only have<font color="#E5E5E5"> i gotten both</font>

1215
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:30,930
the positive and negative reactions

1216
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:34,190
about mental health but almost everyone

1217
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:36,720
I've talked to in the last few years

1218
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:39,060
when they talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it people have been</font>

1219
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:42,509
surprised you know they're funny they're

1220
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:44,369
outgoing you know they they have all

1221
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:46,020
this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> together and people are</font>

1222
00:58:44,369 --> 00:58:48,330
surprised when they when they open up to

1223
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:52,200
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or they've been shamed</font>

1224
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:54,750
into thinking it's their fault so while

1225
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,830
it's not even it's not even easy to talk

1226
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:56,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the beginning you have all</font>

up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like force it to go away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so i</font>

1269
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:15,270
their family just mess around whatever

1270
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:20,490

1271
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:22,830
internet friends so there's so many so

1272
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:25,100
many or resources that you have you have

1273
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:30,600
resources in here your resources

1274
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:32,700
nationwide that you can use I think

1275
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:35,850
going back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the survey I didn't I</font>

1276
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:37,529
didn't want to like spam you with like a

1277
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:39,990
million survey results because I figure

1278
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:42,000
that would be super boring but i think

1279
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:42,540
the saddest part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the survey were 22</font>

1280
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,610
of the question

1281
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:47,700
one of them was have you ever felt like

1282
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:50,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">you weren't worth much as a person over</font>

1283
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:52,710
fifty percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people answered yes and</font>

1284
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:58,140
over forty percent said they thought

1285
01:02:52,710 --> 01:03:00,030
their life was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a worthwhile I feel like</font>

1286
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:03,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">having more of an open dialogues about</font>

1287
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:07,950
this would kill it as a tablet thing to

1288
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:12,840
talk about so I almost got all the way

1289
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:14,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the end to even if you don't like</font>
