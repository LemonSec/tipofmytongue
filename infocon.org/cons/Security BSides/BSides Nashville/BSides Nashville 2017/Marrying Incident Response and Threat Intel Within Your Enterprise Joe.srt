that these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are their research on that</font>

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,180
and so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would do personally is</font>

9
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">classy didn't going on and I'm seeing a</font>

wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to partner up with</font>

12
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,680
attorneys people will look for is here

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,660
the awareness program needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> teach people</font>

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,690
people with this room very few hours I

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,459
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be you know a lot</font>

16
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,360
of all time of yours if you're redlining

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,030
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> 24-7 forget about to stop</font>

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,489
taking seriously put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that together</font>

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:01:01,800
resistance is going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the compliment</font>

20
00:00:50,489 --> 00:01:04,080
why absolutely and let's shift gears for

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,280
a moment and actually talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,740
ransomware so here you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,360
see this chances are either you're on

24
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,820
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bbc's website looking at the blog</font>

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,250
post that I found this on or you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,110
infected with tattoo ransomware with

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,119
that being said bin let's go through

28
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:25,890
this a little bit so out of curiosity

29
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,619
right here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the right we have the</font>

30
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,920
contents of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> yarra file yarra being yet</font>

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,960
another regular expression analyzer

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,180
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data here by a show of</font>

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,780
hands who thinks this is actual threat

34
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,659
intelligence anyone sorry it's a little

35
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,680
blurry let me read it to you a little

36
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:49,350
bit so right<font color="#CCCCCC"> here we see description</font>

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:52,470
winrar SFX module it's in full word

38
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,589
ASCII form then we have some lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

39
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">manual ah the ID below indicates</font>

40
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,820
application support for Windows 10 a few

41
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:04,949
other things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that then condition we</font>

42
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:06,779
have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> un 16 file size and some</font>

43
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,690
conditions at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom those are</font>

44
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:14,209
strings from binaries so given that

45
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,209
information is this threat intelligence

46
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:29,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">mozingo that's where you work where you</font>

47
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:32,280
work so right exactly so I to caveat a

48
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,280
caveat what Stephen said it is Intel but

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,480
it depends on your environment it

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,130
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're going to do with</font>

51
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,420
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you just have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this great that's a</font>

52
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,310
nice piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of intelligence but unless</font>

53
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,000
you're actively scanning for it in your

54
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,890
environment it's really useless you want

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,920
to talk a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it right</font>

56
00:02:46,890 --> 00:03:05,488
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to pull it over your cigars</font>

57
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:11,208
done things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well if your</font>

58
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:11,209
environment is an exam people text<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

59
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:23,910
not intelligent but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not something</font>

60
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:30,780
that's how do what we kind of earlier

61
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:38,720
start seeing a lot of noise<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what you</font>

62
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:44,040
mean to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say is it lacks context hey</font>

63
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:46,140
slightly rehearsed Oh slightly<font color="#E5E5E5"> wit with</font>

64
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,519
that being said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that goes to the age-old</font>

65
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,440
example like when you go through sans

66
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,790
training for like security<font color="#E5E5E5"> 504 for the</font>

67
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">incident handling class the example they</font>

68
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,670
give you is hey you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this linux</font>

69
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,900
server and here's these attempts at

70
00:03:53,670 --> 00:04:01,828
exploiting I is is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> an incident know</font>

71
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:05,610
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISS windows and you're on</font>

72
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:10,730
a Linux box so no it's all about the

73
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:13,410
context so moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this is a jigsaw</font>

74
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:16,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">thanks student for the the pictures from</font>

75
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:19,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">your company you know I'm yet to see</font>

76
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,720
them I hear they're pretty good but

77
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,669
anyway out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this inning given the data</font>

78
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:42,960
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen is this threat</font>

79
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:44,940
intelligence absolutely so again this is

80
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,120
intelligence but<font color="#E5E5E5"> until you apply it</font>

81
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:51,240
within your organization within your

82
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,460
enterprise to get the context associated

83
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,580
with it again you'll see application

84
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,320
data and a registry key what lacks the

85
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:04,560
directory application data and

86
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:07,590
registries yeah so if you're seeing

87
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,479
stuff with this you know any XD file

88
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:15,239
that's another thing you're you know

89
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:16,440
come on all sorts of fun stuff and with

90
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,060
this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can kind of see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

91
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,200
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pose us Firefox and dropbox</font>

92
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:25,770
with FR<font color="#CCCCCC"> FX and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dr p box but with this</font>

93
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:28,530
what could you do with it very simply

94
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:31,229
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> check the existence of the</font>

95
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,659
registry keys via something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Yara</font>

96
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:35,400
like sticks your sim may have that

97
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:37,380
capability as well you could write<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

98
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,560
own regular expressions and not even us

99
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,320
tiara if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a level you can use otx</font>

100
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,000
which we will talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in a little bit</font>

101
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:50,159
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can watch for connections to the sea</font>

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,800
to server the BTC dot block or I owe you

103
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:56,250
can monitor for files called Bitcoin

104
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,310
blackmailer exe with the Firefox logo on

105
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,360
them by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way and at that point when</font>

106
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,919
you have that and you're actively

107
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,349
monitoring your environment you're doing

108
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:09,260
the checks then do you have threat

109
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:14,300
intelligence better right

110
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:17,539
anything to add been so here's just an

111
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,580
example of the yarra yarra rules github

112
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,170
if you're actually going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use your</font>

113
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,300
rules this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good place to go</font>

114
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:25,760
to get some that's where the petrol one

115
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,280
came from they've got all sorts of

116
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,370
malware and other exploits there so if

117
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,229
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scan with it and actually</font>

118
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:35,960
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data and interpret the results</font>

119
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:42,910
and act upon the results then this is a

120
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:45,159
good place to go so kick us off here

121
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:48,980
incorporating with the incident or spa

122
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,840
well I accept earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep what you have</font>

123
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">any strange things look at an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attack</font>

124
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:59,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">your fire the perfect day would be to</font>

125
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,350
incorporate<font color="#CCCCCC"> that into a good cure their</font>

126
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,890
awareness training things like that

127
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:11,660
don't work I agree it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gimmick</font>

128
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:20,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">for training so there's any hope we take</font>

129
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:23,570
the trends things like ASAP have enough

130
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:27,580
coffee yet I take my<font color="#CCCCCC"> hate for you sick</font>

131
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:32,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know it's so cold enough it'll</font>

132
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:35,780
probably be proactive and

133
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">information-sharing you might see</font>

134
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:43,460
something come across your environment

135
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:48,110
that would likely impact a<font color="#CCCCCC"> org attack of</font>

136
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:51,469
carbon<font color="#E5E5E5"> tax out that may be a competitor</font>

137
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,180
or something that somebody's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

138
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:57,700
directly affect you both be professional

139
00:07:53,180 --> 00:08:00,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">heritage you give them a heads up yeah</font>

140
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,539
you think like that that goes include

141
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,960
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Intel's and sherry possible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> threat</font>

142
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:08,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">on this but you know I think most</font>

143
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,150
organizations aren't really ready to do

144
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,409

in the respect that human error will

<font color="#E5E5E5">not necessarily acting upon of course</font>

206
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,189
harden your your cloud services your

207
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:21,170
cloud instances but you should

208
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,210
definitely integrate that into your your

209
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,760
threat landscape and your incident

210
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,680
response plan so what happens when you

211
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,560
have an AWS instance that all of a

212
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,660
sudden starts firing outbound UDP port

213

80 packets what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do who do you</font>

call what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are your actions what does</font>

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:41,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">that indicate could it have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,240
prevented<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you had proper threat</font>

217
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:49,790
intelligence and the answer honestly to

218
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:51,950
that is maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's with this there's</font>

219
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,650
there's just as much art as there a

220
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:57,110
science as there is philosophy and then

221
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:58,480
anytime incident response comes up we've

222
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,400
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about business continuity</font>

223
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,980
disaster recovery contingency planning

224
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:07,939
and continuity of operations simply upon

225
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:10,760
the premise of a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things are the</font>

226
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:13,880
same so here's another theoretical for

227
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,160
you you're watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> the news you see</font>

228
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:25,130
there's a tornado coming is that threat

229
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:29,569
intelligence towards you with with your

230
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:35,380
mother-in-law<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a bicycle with her</font>

231
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:35,380
flying monkeys so

232
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:51,410
exactly it's fuzzy so to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of refine</font>

233
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:55,490
that a little bit the sirens go off you

234
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:58,850
see on TV there's an ef5 tornado a mile

235
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:04,930
and a half from your data center is that

236
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:07,040
actionable threat intelligence towards

237
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:15,130
and it's your mother-in-law and her

238
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:17,689
sister with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flying monkey and scream</font>

239
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:25,670
with malware on<font color="#CCCCCC"> flash drive screaming</font>

240
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:28,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll get you my pretty so the exactly if</font>

241
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:29,870
you have a warm<font color="#CCCCCC"> side or a hot site call</font>

242
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,400
them up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and be like hey there's an ef5</font>

243
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,840
headed towards our data center you might

244
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,040
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to head to the site you know</font>

245
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,810
especially if it's a warm side at the

246
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:43,459
top side they're already there but if

247
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:47,030
it's a warm actually actually actually

248
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:49,610
you know what let's adjust this for 2017

249
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:52,040
let's be realistic for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a second all</font>

250
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:54,740
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be real with you it's</font>

251
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">very rare that i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just candid what</font>

252
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:59,060
you're supposed to do is go outside and

253
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:01,250
take a picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and put it on</font>

256
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:14,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do and then send an email to the</font>

257
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:15,319
fire department urgently telling them

258
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:20,209
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need their</font>

259
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:24,020
assistance later so extra<font color="#E5E5E5"> extra credit</font>

260
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:25,850
if you know the reference there but

261
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,920
either way you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to actually</font>

262
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">incorporate this with your training in</font>

263
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,420
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> culture so when you're talking</font>

264
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,690
about this is going to amplify your

265
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,490
proactive stance and this is very much

266
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:40,990
towards the incident response

267
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:43,370
perspective get your employees engaged

268
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:46,550
to skip to that bottom point you need to

269
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:47,540
management commitment if if your

270
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,819
employees know that manage

271
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,649
is not committed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

272
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,389
security program your training program

273
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:56,180
your Incident Response program why

274
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:57,440
should they be that's the exact opinion

275
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,469
most of them are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take you're</font>

276
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,779
going to have some that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

277
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:04,100
without deviation continue forth but if

278
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:07,959
you have management<font color="#E5E5E5"> commitment it's</font>

279
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,959
going to be a better program all around

280
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:26,180
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can challenge them about to get real</font>

281
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:29,800
serious but you know I see this isn't

282
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:32,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">your ideas about to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go addressing issues</font>

283
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,609
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to at least do something</font>

284
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:41,209
and if not we'll then at that point it's

285
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:42,709
outside it's time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull out the dawn</font>

291
00:15:56,329 --> 00:16:02,449
other types of attacks it helps malware

292

sensitive data I mean credential

294
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:11,750

within my organization clicks a fish I

298
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,769

00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:27,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get punished unless it's a recurring</font>

304
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:33,920

305
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:35,750
in terms of what to do do we want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

310
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:47,689
that non-punitive policy your employees

311
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,730
are more apt to actually report it to

312
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:53,719
you and from the incident<font color="#E5E5E5"> response</font>

313
00:16:49,730 --> 00:17:16,790
perspective patient zero is known to use

314
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:19,040
that analogy if you are if I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

318
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:27,230
girls are getting bored to death in box

319
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:30,020
because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not seeing that much</font>

320
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:32,330
berkeley<font color="#CCCCCC"> put is actually spam or</font>

321
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,740
phishing attacks you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that did</font>

322
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:39,649
you know that they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very engaged</font>

323
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:42,590
and go back to increases easy as well

324
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,570
and also with that proactive stance you

325
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:47,418
have built it dared wait for<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

326
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:51,590
at and say hi well we have a business

327
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:53,650
continuity plan for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dogs and things</font>

328
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:56,360
like that a few months ago when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

329
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:58,640
hotness cooperation<font color="#E5E5E5"> your key Dolph and</font>

330
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,090
everything under the Sun all right well

331
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,620
don't think oh yeah well we've gotten to

332
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:08,840
supper<font color="#E5E5E5"> without a back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> equation for wins</font>

333
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:10,939
it doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be safe and start</font>

334
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,040
maybe it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that I'm here to your</font>

335
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,299
tabletop that beside and like that they

336
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:22,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">just want to go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pop up or</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">literally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pressure of people time and</font>

338
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:29,000
the final point I have on the slide in

339
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:31,370
terms of training people one thing I'm

340
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,020
actually working with in terms of trying

341
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:35,899
to increase awareness and have a

342
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:39,650
successful awareness programs i found

343
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:41,780
that training people to protect their

344
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:45,559
children online is an excellent way to

345
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:47,690
hit a<font color="#E5E5E5"> home because that that parental</font>

346
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:49,879
instinct kicks in it's like you don't

347
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,530
mess<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my kids you know I don't have</font>

348
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">kids but if I did if you mess with them</font>

349
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:56,600
then you might meet negan and I might

350
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:59,270
bring Lucille that's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> how I am my</font>

351
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,969
niece I do the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if someone</font>

352
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:03,980
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you train people at work how</font>

353
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,480
to protect their children online they're

354
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,220
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take that home they're going to</font>

355
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,320
find applicability for it there

356
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about it it's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to resonate</font>

357
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,500
with them and then they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

358

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,039
actually have a file you could upload

427
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,809
that as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

428
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:50,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular file to upload but if you did</font>

429
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:52,250
you could upload it it'll analyze it and

430
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,440
i'll tell you paying this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is or it isn't</font>

431
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:57,230
and it's not a definitive answers is

432
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:00,890
this known or if this unknown it could

433
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:11,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">still be malware and show is no or it</font>

434
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:14,590
could be legit and show is yes it's true

435
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,590
it's true

436
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:58,800
come on man there we go oh yeah never

437
00:24:41,170 --> 00:25:03,000
again they have 3.5 million domains<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

438
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,000
hard to see on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this screen I apologize</font>

439

domo arigato they're throwing us under

440
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:49,540
the bus first try yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the</font>

441
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:52,080
real<font color="#E5E5E5"> Delta now yeah so here's another</font>

442
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:55,960
place when talking threat intelligence

443
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:58,870
this is a tool i do want to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hit</font>

444
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:02,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level illness no okay this is</font>

445
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:03,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">otx this is an alien vault product open</font>

446
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:07,600
thread exchange it is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of</font>

447
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:12,850
threat intelligence again it's need a

448
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:15,459
feed but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about it is if you</font>

449
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:17,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">just read it you might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be smarter for</font>

450
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,120
reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but it's still not threat</font>

451
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,860
intelligence you have to apply it and

452
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,350
without<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting into the whole</font>

453
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,939
alienvault ecosystem there's the whole

454
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:26,889
thing that goes in with their sim system

455
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:30,220
that works with this but either way

456
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:31,660
here's a delta ticket thing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found</font>

457
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">it ironic that it's here it's not the</font>

458
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,430
same one but here's some pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

459
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:41,919
that actually feed into it to help you

460
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:42,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">out so here we see there's the reference</font>

461
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,400
that

462
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:48,340
talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a vba macro dot</font>

463
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,700
doc surprise surprise think back to that

464
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:54,639
slide it's one of the number one vectors

465
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:58,870
from here within the summary we see we

466
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:02,010
have one URL 15 IP addresses for domains

467
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:06,790
and email address and a host name so

468
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:13,300
given that information let's send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font>

469
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:20,230
the jury again is this threat

470
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:21,700
intelligence<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok good good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if</font>

471
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,920
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> were if this were a course you all</font>

472
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:28,270
day passes we're good we're good so

473
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:29,400
finals week next week so but with it we

474
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:33,910
see that there's a different URL

475
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:35,800
associated with it so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this actually</font>

476
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:39,760
came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> from me searching</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Delta with 2</font>

477
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:42,550
a's that's where it came from so with

478
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,040
this what could<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do to actually use</font>

479
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:48,070
this at threat intelligence you could

480
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:50,170
set up monitoring rules perhaps looking

481
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:54,129
for incoming emails from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Delta with 2</font>

482
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:56,980
a's<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm you could block it you could</font>

483
00:27:54,130 --> 00:28:00,550
watch for traffic to or from these IP

484
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:02,110
addresses same thing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the URLs the</font>

00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:16,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">hostname you can watch out for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

486
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:18,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">this stuff or um with this right now</font>

487
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:23,949
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing one way or another if</font>

488
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:26,370
it's in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will say yeah either way</font>

489
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,370
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I</font>

490
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:44,630
gen me right and in some organizations

491
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:47,060
if you have the the team and the talent

492
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:49,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know getting that file and</font>

493
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:51,409
actually reversing it and getting even

494
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,240
more actionable information out of it to

495
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:55,970
create<font color="#CCCCCC"> a yarra file for that specific</font>

496
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,860
document or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> styx file whatever you</font>

497
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:00,170
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything any regular expression to</font>

498
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:02,000
look for things like magic numbers

499
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:04,790
contained within it the hash the file

500
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,410
size various characteristics<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

501
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:09,010
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but the thing is not every</font>

502
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:10,970
organization has that capability and

503
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:12,770
downloading the<font color="#CCCCCC"> files can be very tricky</font>

504
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:14,930
because it's one flight of the hand and

505
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:17,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">you click it well you're executing it so</font>

506
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:20,540
you would need a dedicated system to

507
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:22,430
actually get it there to actually let it

508
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,930
let it do its thing you could detonate

509
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:26,000
it if you have the capability as well

510
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:28,580
when I say capability I'm referring more

511
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,380
of the talent internally as opposed to

512
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:36,169
the ability to double-click and let

513
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:41,150
something run budget talent pretty much

514
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:49,550
in line budgets by talent so but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

515
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:51,740
just one example so so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a</font>

516
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:58,180
little bit about this doohickey here

517
00:29:51,740 --> 00:30:00,830
anybody ever heard of digital shadows so

518
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:03,740
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just skip the marketing marketing</font>

519
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:11,120
data here and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know do you want to</font>

520
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:19,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell us in essence what they do research</font>

521
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:22,580
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the monitoring for data dump or</font>

522
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:26,510
things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> exploits anything that</font>

00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:36,410
discuss packet forms of Arctic leases

525
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:41,199
things like that for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me it's other days</font>

526
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:45,090
that beyond<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working at</font>

527

our<font color="#E5E5E5"> facilities</font>

528
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:52,449
like that as well you know let's say

529
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:55,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you find data on here what data are</font>

530
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:57,610
they finding on there then all right so

531
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:59,830
who would have had access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this data</font>

532
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:02,469
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you started</font>

533
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:05,289
rolling into may be working<font color="#E5E5E5"> more towards</font>

attribution you Velma education park I

535
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:11,529
think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was initially the time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font>

00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:14,200
trying somebody from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the report things</font>

537
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:19,179
like that but I think sometimes that

540
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:33,190
stateside this is true as well yeah

541
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:37,480
things like that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had extra data or</font>

of what occurred within this I mean it

548
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:58,240
is also the data is it's just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that was it an insider threat you know</font>

553
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,510
that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those things that I</font>
