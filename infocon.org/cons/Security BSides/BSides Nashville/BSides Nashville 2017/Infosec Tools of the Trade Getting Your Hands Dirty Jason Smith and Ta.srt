<font color="#CCCCCC">entry-level people I so talk I would</font>

should be so this is for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that</font>

47
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,380
are new it is basically the greenest of

48
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:56,269
green talks minus the whole well if

63
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,390
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> because like my sophomore year</font>

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,609
of college which kind of you know

65
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:42,200
sparked my interest and you know how to

66
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:45,349
computers talk to each other and kind of

67
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">learning about packet captures but that</font>

68
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:48,768
didn't really keep my interest i was in

69
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,810
physics so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really hold all that</font>

70
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:53,599
information until after<font color="#E5E5E5"> i graduated and</font>

73
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,390

74
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,090
me to do they just knew they needed a

75
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:04,309

76
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,480
first year of work was kind of find what

00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:51,469
slightly different way that you can kind

144
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:53,689
of take it away and maybe show some

145
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:55,219
other people we like to mentor a lot of

146
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:57,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">people up in bowling green and here in</font>

147
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:59,719
Nashville and try to pull in different

148
00:06:57,739 --> 00:07:01,099
people if they are interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

149
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,419
high schoolers who think where there's

150
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:04,429
not really anything I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what to</font>

151
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:06,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">do in college</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just know i hack to go</font>

152
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:08,268
or like well you know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

153
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:10,909
alternatives and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do while</font>

154
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:14,360
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> college which you know we go into in</font>

155
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:16,610
this talk and not targeted people who

156
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,639
are like oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right way to</font>

157
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:21,889
teach people<font color="#E5E5E5"> love you know that can be</font>

158
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,319
told afterwards you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we can fix this</font>

159
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:25,879
up as needed after but for the most part

160
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,919
if you're like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not advanced</font>

161
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,379
enough it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably because you are to</font>

162
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,729
advance and the talk probably isn't

163
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:39,409
geared for you yep so please now number

164
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:43,008
you know so yeah so what we're talking

165
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:44,779
about today is operations in security we

166
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:47,869
won't really talk much about compliance

167
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:50,209
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> administration but for the sake of</font>

168
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:53,149
knowing compliance is really why we all

169
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:55,009
have jobs there are laws made that say

170
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:58,449
the companies have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the security</font>

171
00:07:55,009 --> 00:08:00,610
stuff and so what we do is over

172
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:02,020
some guys are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some gals like hey we</font>

173
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,389
should probably actually operational

174
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,340
security and monitor stuff or maybe do

175
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:09,430
some sort of vulnerability testing or

176
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:12,068
pin testing and so those jobs occur but

177
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">rarely were those jobs the laws made so</font>

178
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:16,599
compliance is<font color="#CCCCCC"> its kind of where things</font>

179
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:18,370
start from a legal perspective and where

180
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:20,409
a lot of companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> really get into gear</font>

181
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,330
on getting security<font color="#E5E5E5"> operations going</font>

182
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:23,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">afterwards</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smart like you're auditing</font>

183
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:26,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">groups so you want to be in an auditor</font>

184
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,849
and go in and say hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how is</font>

185
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,770
this company doing with security that

186
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:30,969
would be a compliance job you'd be in an

187
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,010
auditing role so what we talked about

188
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,389
today isn't the limit to security in

189
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,669
case you're interested there are also a

190
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:38,169
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of compliance jobs more than most</font>

191
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:40,870
jobs actually they're more compliance

192
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,458
gigs maybe not here necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you</font>

193
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">know lives in Charleston for instance</font>

194
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:46,959
and in just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization I work with</font>

195
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,510
their they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 auditors in one</font>

196
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,099
office so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of auditing</font>

197
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,360
positions but there's also

198
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,070
administration won't talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

199
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">much they basically keep things going</font>

200
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,990
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not always super technical</font>

201
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,820
they're always super needed so how do

202
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,170
you learn this stuff basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> we always</font>

203
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,660
recommend that you know somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

204
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:06,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">who's trying to learn this stuff or know</font>

205
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,500
what somebody who already does the stuff

206
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,510
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always very productive if you can</font>

207
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,699
go on and not learn the stuff on your

208
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,529
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's easy to fall off the</font>

209
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:16,839
wagon if you're new to it it may seem

210
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:18,279
overly complicated overly technical but

211
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,870
if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody else they may say</font>

212
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,790
oh well this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually how this is</font>

213
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,680
done or you may be able to help them say

214
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:25,449
well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as hard as you think let's</font>

215
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,180
get the result and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can figure out you</font>

216
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:30,519
know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process and things like that we</font>

217
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:33,399
also are trying to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everything</font>

218
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:36,040
we show here is all free it doesn't cost

219
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:38,199
money to learn this stuff there are

220
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,699
costly ways of doing it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> from your</font>

221
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:41,709
house you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for free</font>

222
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:44,079
right so the main goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to talk about</font>

223
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:45,849
the operations team what operations

224
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:47,649
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you wanted to get</font>

225
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,899
started in that role what are things you

226
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:52,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for free at home to kind of get</font>

227
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:56,430
yourself started as an<font color="#CCCCCC"> entry-level</font>

228
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,660
person so first we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about operations</font>

229
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:02,019
mainly we're going to talk red team and

230
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:03,760
blue team stuff red team are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hacker</font>

231
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:08,170
types and blue team or the surveillance

232
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:11,800
types of more detail about those so red

233
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,339
team so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> here basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a job</font>

234
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">description</font>

235
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:16,509
if anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been researching for a</font>

236
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:19,689
job lately you've probably ran through a

237
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:21,970
million job descriptions they all look

238
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:24,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this you can't read that because</font>

239
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:27,339
you zone out and they all<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask for you to</font>

240
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">know a million different things and it's</font>

241
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:30,730
kind of hard to think just<font color="#E5E5E5"> by reading a</font>

242
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,800
job<font color="#CCCCCC"> description like what would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

243
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,360
actual day today look like like what

244
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,040
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> this person actually do because</font>

245
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,199
they really just want you to do

246
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything right the process is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

247
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:42,339
for no matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> what level of experience</font>

248
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are generally if you're looking for</font>

249
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:46,029
a new job you come across a bunch of

250
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff and if you are timid you're</font>

251
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:49,959
probably like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

252
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,059
of this stuff this is I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like maybe</font>

253
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:56,199
I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be farther and that's where a</font>

254
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:58,600
lot of oh what's the syndrome<font color="#CCCCCC"> impostor</font>

255
00:10:56,199 --> 00:11:00,279
syndrome village and earlier yes where a

256
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,249
lot of that comes from is that you have

257
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:05,459
big listings like this and they seem

258
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:09,699
impossibly hard to actually get to learn

259
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:12,628
but in reality the real job what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

260
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:15,309
pen tester do lots of different stuff

261
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:17,290
mainly you test for vulnerabilities you

262
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:19,269
try to exploit them you try to help

263
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,519
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how to resolve</font>

264
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:23,379
those issues that you found works

265
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,439
portable so you're helping companies

266
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:28,480
basically protect their environment you

267
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:31,360
do that there's also social engineering

268
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,980
so everyone's heard of you know fake

269
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,740
calling trying to get passwords from

270
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,839
people or sending phishing emails so

271
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,019
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> lots of social engineering</font>

272
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,879
events that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do as a pin tester</font>

273
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,439
you make malware of course because

274
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it exploits to</font>

275
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:48,370
exploit things so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of like</font>

276
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:49,899
if you like coding and you know if

277
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,249
you're really into figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how</font>

278
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:53,470
exploits were can you light coating

279
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:55,569
probably a job you'll really enjoy and

280
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,550
you do lots of reporting about half the

281
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:59,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">time and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a pen testing job</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

282
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do your test and then you're going to</font>

283
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,089
spend a solid amount of time writing

284
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:09,040
reports you hate technical writing

285
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:12,429
there's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> warning so blue team I love</font>

286
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,079
network security monitoring obviously we

287
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:16,269
do network security monitoring which is

288
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,829
neo monitoring network traffic going to

289
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:19,929
and from different<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts and different</font>

290
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:22,179
networks and all kinds of good stuff bad

291
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:24,829
guys good guys we do host monitoring

292
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:27,770
which is usually a subset of

293
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:30,050
when's once we find bad stuff host minor

294
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">is you know going through the actual you</font>

295
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">know host device or something like that</font>

296
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,450
maybe pulling logs or maybe you already

297
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:38,660
send them to some other searching tool a

298
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:41,360
lot of surveillance type stuff we track

299
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:44,600
bad guys and we track good guys alike

300
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:48,500
friendly detection or friendly acid

301
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,690
detection and also tracking bad guys we

302
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,640
analyze malware sometimes so there are

303
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:54,740
dedicated people to analyzing malware

304
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,180
they're dedicated people for network

305
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,620
security monitoring their dedicated

306
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,930
people for basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> each one of these</font>

307
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:02,570
things and the same can go for red team

308
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,880
work as well that in some some gigs you

309
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,370
know you may be dedicated more towards

310
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,500
one aspect of those and in blue team

311
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,840
gigs you may be dedicated when in one

312
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,000
aspect of these and some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just</font>

313
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,900
so you know jack of all trades<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do a</font>

314
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,630
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different things so so infosec is</font>

315
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,579
actually quite easy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun right to you</font>

316
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,010
there's like 10 things at most you can

317
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,200
do red team and blue team right well

318
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:29,480
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a few different things</font>

319
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,850
there are a lot of tools involved it's

320
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">not just five tools for one and five</font>

321
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,410
tools for the other and and it may look

322
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,330
like you have to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this stuff</font>

323
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:41,510
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just that job description</font>

324
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:46,250
all over again so it may be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

325
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:48,770
rough but in reality you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

326
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,990
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't too bad so essentially</font>

327
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:53,000
when you start out things are mile wide

328
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,980
and an inch deep<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially if you don't</font>

329
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a focus on what you like lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

330
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">people don't already know what they like</font>

331
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,620
I mean you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been in Red Team Blue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Team</font>

332
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">an administration I'm still figuring out</font>

333
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,520
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so all right and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

334
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,810
that's the idea is that if you if you

335
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,880
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a career out of this that's what</font>

336
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,770
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing the good news is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once</font>

337
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,360
you get past this learning curve right

338
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,400
here which is pretty difficult to do

339
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,770
it's like you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning more stuff</font>

340
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,689
than ever quicker than ever and it's a

341
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:19,640
more impact than ever and these jobs

342
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,980
start to look more obvious than ever and

343
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,900
things aren't so bad and before you know

344
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,060
it a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years later you're already</font>

345
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,130
coasting up here at the top and it's

346
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,079
kind of easy street and then some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

347
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,120
will go a little bit farther and they go

348
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,700
crazy about analyzing malware and and

349
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,680
maybe if you're a Red Team person you

350
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,360
you're actually doing all these bug

351
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,819
bounties and all kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font>

352
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,529
so you can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as fun as you want as</font>

353
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,820
difficult as you want but know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

354
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:45,800
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a learning curve no matter what</font>

355
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:50,089
you do and you'll get past it it's just

356
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,769
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of time so before we go forward</font>

357
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:54,529
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tools and</font>

358
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:55,730
we just want to warn everybody you know

359
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:56,930
if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up these tools and</font>

360
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">place them at home we highly recommend</font>

361
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:01,099
it but we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> advise a lot of caution</font>

362
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,720
please don't do this on public networks

363
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,980
or anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't belong to you</font>

364
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,209
or anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you do not have</font>

365
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:09,470
explicit permission to test highly legal

366
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:10,930
usually we feel like nobody can see us

367
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,760
on the internet I'm behind my computer

368
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:16,189
false a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are watching with</font>

369
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,620
blue team tools and you can't quite do

370
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,600
it yeah a lot of legislation is in place

371
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">and a lot of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fear this idea of</font>

372
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,430
hackers are going to get me because

373
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,950
people are getting God all the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

374
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:31,130
caution be careful so all those tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

375
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:32,870
mentioned just<font color="#CCCCCC"> forget about I mean in</font>

376
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:35,240
reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll come across what you need</font>

377
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,279
as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have but there are some</font>

378
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,380
concepts more that that you should

379
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,149
really try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into from our</font>

380
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">perspective at least it was this is this</font>

381
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:47,779
is what helped us it's what we still use

382
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:49,420
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some prereqs I think that a</font>

383
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:51,680
person who is an information security

384
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:55,420
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be pretty well-versed at the</font>

385
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,229
command line at a linux distro of choice

386
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:00,019
specifically we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to talk about a</font>

387
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:02,600
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tools few different isos</font>

388
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:04,550
that will create these virtual machines

389
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,160
growing aware of what those are we'll

390
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:09,740
talk about those<font color="#CCCCCC"> failure briefly but</font>

391
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,510
look at these tools look them up these

392
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">are free things that you can download</font>

393
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:17,000
and they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you going again these</font>

394
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:18,769
are some links to how to really get

395
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,260
practice at the command line even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

396
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,970
don't even have it set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> just yet and</font>

397
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,649
and basically these aren't specifically

398
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,779
related to<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec directly they're</font>

399
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:29,209
related to all things idea especially

400
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:31,189
like coding or anything like that but

401
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:34,550
they will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very very valuable in</font>

402
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:36,260
infosec so virtual machines if you want

403
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:38,420
to set up a lab at home highly recommend

404
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,949
virtual machines does everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

405
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,589
anyone not<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what virtual machines</font>

406
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:44,479
are never heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them well that's a</font>

407
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:46,490
loaded question it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of questions</font>

408
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,100
all knows a virtual machines are this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

409
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,820
where Mary out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">zarna</font>

411
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,880
virtual machines if you're fairly new

412
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:56,870
virtual machines<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're basically just</font>

413
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">running machines within machines yeah we</font>

414
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't really yeah it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious keep into</font>

415
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,410
that always do it y'all get all right

416
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,209
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a host machine that you know</font>

417
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:07,339
some some guy on a host the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font>

418
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,560
like hey I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have this windows vm</font>

419
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:11,810
virtual machine up because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

420
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,490
some zany things against this windows vm

421
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:16,129
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> window is more likely to be</font>

422
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">vulnerable to whatever and so they spin</font>

423
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,630
up over a virtual machine and maybe they

424
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,190
have this attacker vm as well to test

425
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,810
against they don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have multiple</font>

426
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:27,680
machines to do this they do it all

427
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:29,870
within their main host device a few

428
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:33,350
flavors of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux that will get you going</font>

429
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:36,949
is go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> download just a basic</font>

430
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:39,050
ubuntu desktop and so you'll download an

431
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,270
iso and you'll make a vm again<font color="#CCCCCC"> google</font>

432
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,070
all that but it'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a basic way to get</font>

433
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,410
to a terminal an actual terminal that

434
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can mess around with after you get</font>

435
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,760
kind of familiar with that how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

436
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,560
install this stuff download cali and

437
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,240
security onion if you're unsure if you

438
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,280
wanted red or blue<font color="#CCCCCC"> team go ahead and</font>

439
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,020
start and try doing both things like

440
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out that you know a few is like</font>

441
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that commonly use tools here and if you</font>

442
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:03,470
commonly used tool to there and get

443
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">going eventually you'll feel very</font>

444
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:09,710
comfortable at the terminal this is it's

445
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:11,000
pretty pretty important here I it seems

446
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,010
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said you know a whole fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> e-gift</font>

447
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's great you literally have unlimited</font>

448
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:18,290
power<font color="#E5E5E5"> to terminal and so you have people</font>

449
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">like we can't you do this in Excel well</font>

450
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:23,470
no you can't do all this stuff in Excel

451
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:26,450
right I heard some some<font color="#CCCCCC"> facepalms good</font>

452
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:28,400
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux you'll use grep said not and</font>

453
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,840
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other stuff but a lot of grip</font>

454
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,240
setting off and you'll script those

455
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,939
together and in the end you'll say hey I

456
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,340
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unlimited power</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to some degree</font>

457
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:40,160
like where if you learn these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

458
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:43,580
to the extent you can literally do

459
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,410
anything so<font color="#CCCCCC"> give any questions on that</font>

460
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,240
right yeah any questions all we want to

461
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:50,960
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it to where we can open up</font>

462
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:53,680
questions in the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay no</font>

463
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,780
questions that's good everyone gets it

464
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:59,390
so networking before you get started it

465
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:03,250
is a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a good idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

466
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:03,250
how networks function how they work

467
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:10,260
so just understanding the basics playing

468
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,670
around there's so much hardware

469
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,250
available you can literally go to

470
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:16,770
goodwill and<font color="#CCCCCC"> by routers goodwill ebay</font>

471
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:20,130
there's so many resources available a

472
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:22,110
lot of schools there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

473
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that donate have you need some hardware</font>

474
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,290
and please just reach out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

want to play<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your will on basic</font>

476
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,760
network yeah we're loaning it or

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,210
set up at home so you can play around

479
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,610
and you know monitor<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own traffic</font>

480
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">but for now you can download Wireshark</font>

481
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,510
on your pc if you don't start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

482
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">demons or anything on your windows box</font>

483
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,020
on whatever box you have you can

484
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,820
download Wireshark and start monitoring

485
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,040
your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic and will show you just</font>

486
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,240
an example of what that looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like if</font>

487
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,700
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to learn more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

488
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,490
Wireshark get practical pack analysis

489
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:56,340
version 3 there's the author right back

490
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:58,320
there yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away one of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">basics</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of security monitoring and the</font>

494
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,500
advanced stuff and security monitoring

495
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,630
and the command line stuff and security

496
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,610
monitoring that it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our security book</font>

497
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,890
I ever read no joke it's not technically

498
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:16,050
a security book so but<font color="#E5E5E5"> now it literally</font>

499
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">has tons of security examples regular</font>

500
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:20,909
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing it fits everybody I was on</font>

501
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,010
a cruise not long ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and reading this</font>

502
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,480
like if it's that good that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do it on</font>

503
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:29,310
a cruise like man I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read that</font>

504
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:34,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">book I highly recommend it right thank</font>

505
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:35,669
you so full packet captures and we

506
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,250
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the full recordings of</font>

507
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:40,470
things getting all this network traffic

508
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,420
basically we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these tools that</font>

509
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,370
just gathered up and again wireshark can

510
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,380
do it there are command line tools that

511
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,939
can do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can automate it you can do</font>

512
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,830
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds of stuff but in the end it's</font>

513
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,450
pulling mostly the same thing which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

514
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,330
full recording of everything you do on a

515
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,770
network there are tools when the network

516
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,870
traffic is too much that you make

517
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:59,970
metadata out of this stuff or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

518
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:02,040
disconnection records out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like</font>

519
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:04,170
a full recording of a phone call versus

520
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:07,070
just your little connection things that

521
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:09,150
I guess your phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> records email using</font>

522
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:12,480
and then there are things that alleges

523
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:14,730
interesting stuff this is Wireshark this

524
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,130
is what it looks like generally this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

525
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:20,190
meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an intimidating screenshot</font>

526
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">although once you have the one thing</font>

527
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,910
yeah it's less intimidating than TCP w

528
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like that but once you get to</font>

529
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:28,710
learning Wireshark there's all kinds of

530
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,389
statistical tools things like that now

531
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,730
you can get it to do basically whatever

532
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,320
you want to attack it right and again<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

533
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much information they're</font>

534
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,240
tools that just pull metadata from that

535
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,560
data so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a better view of what</font>

536
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,680
you're actually searching will describe

537
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,090
those a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit in this blue team bit</font>

538
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:49,410
blue team work it's basically

539
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:51,840
surveillance mostly here is security

540
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:54,810
onion<font color="#CCCCCC"> scaredy n is basically a big</font>

541
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,780
wrapped up I so a linux distribution

542
00:21:54,810 --> 00:22:00,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">with all of these blue team tools when i</font>

543
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,040
showed you<font color="#E5E5E5"> little graph basically on one</font>

544
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,330
side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that graph we're a bunch of</font>

545
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,889
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are including in security</font>

546
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,720
onion so you don't have to really

547
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,970
install any of this stuff there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

548
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,650
challenge to getting it running you can

549
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,870
get security any and running in a vm you

550
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:15,300
can do this all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools are open</font>

551
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:17,370
source within the security onion you can

552
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,810
you basically reach out and ask for help

553
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,070
on something there's a bug or whatever

554
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,720
you're probably gonna get the tool

555
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,790
author who comes back directly to you

556
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,570
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like hey you didn't try this come</font>

557
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:29,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">on but sometimes they'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very helpful</font>

558
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:32,070
it has a lot of graphical tools a lot of

559
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,080
command<font color="#E5E5E5"> line tools you can basically do</font>

560
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:37,710
everything that you'll do in blue team

561
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:40,050
work you'll do here here's an example of

562
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,850
pulling some of that metadata so right

563
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">here it looks like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of texts to pay</font>

564
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:48,689
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what's actually on here</font>

565
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:51,540
that laser works those work not there so

566
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:55,350
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you they say I'm pulling all of the</font>

567
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:58,500
images that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this person browse to on</font>

568
00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:00,540
this low cost us a calm<font color="#E5E5E5"> and photobucket</font>

569
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,270
com we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically I just said hey</font>

570
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:06,090
print everything out but then just show

571
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:08,129
me the JPEGs and you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top</font>

572
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:10,169
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> here this grep jpg getting out the</font>

573
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:12,420
grip said knock I just said hey show me

574
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:13,800
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> JPEG there at the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this and so</font>

575
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,620
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the files of this person</font>

576
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the silk output here</font>

577
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,909
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make any sense in this context</font>

578
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,880
but this is an example of all those

579
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:26,400
connection records that in huge networks

580
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,290
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can easily pull stats on who is you</font>

581
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the busiest talkers what guys</font>

582
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,850
talking out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> China</font>

583
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,950
but you know any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

584
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,750
want so again that's metadata that's

585
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,880
basically pulled from the full packet

586
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:40,880
capture so you all of these things in

587
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,460
wireshark but you have to really filter

588
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,500
it down on the slide is the faster way

589
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,679
to do it on like large networks large

590
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:51,710
captures this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of network</font>

591
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:53,450
minor<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just put a pcap in and out came</font>

592
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,830
all these pictures<font color="#CCCCCC"> and credentials and</font>

593
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:57,049
all kinds of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you can see the</font>

594
00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:00,470
tab at the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little cough and I</font>

595
00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:03,110
built if it wheels on it and hasn't

596
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:08,230
worked yet but then it hasn't killed me

597
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:08,229
yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll fill it he will talk later</font>

598
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,040
network security monitoring is

599
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,890
collection detection analysis to wrap it

600
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">up in a really summarized way collection</font>

601
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:20,059
you collect all this stuff detection

602
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,830
there are a lot of tools to bring out

603
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:24,710
alerts and things like that and then

604
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:26,720
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do human you know</font>

605
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:31,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">hands-on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and interpret that for</font>

606
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,660
other people the whole process here

607
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,940
there are a lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> tools used</font>

608
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:37,160
to these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> specifically like things</font>

609
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,740
like sword suricata they alert on stuff

610
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,450
you say this is what a signature of what

611
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,980
something bad looks like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

612
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at all your data all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time and</font>

613
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">say oh I found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that signature here's an</font>

614
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,910
alert for it maybe she'll check it out

615
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,830
bro<font color="#E5E5E5"> again data about data but can be</font>

616
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,600
used for detection as well and then

617
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,918
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are all kinds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

618
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,780
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> graphical tools that you can</font>

619
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:58,390
parse through all this data<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show</font>

620
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:01,010
you some examples in just a little bit

621
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:02,870
when we do a Red Team Blue<font color="#E5E5E5"> team example</font>

622
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:04,700
again those are all packaged into

623
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,129
security onion so you don't have to

624
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,679
download<font color="#CCCCCC"> and install them all turnin red</font>

625
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:12,500
team tools so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a different set of</font>

626
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,770
tools some tools we share with blue team

627
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:17,419
but we have a specific operating system

628
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,860
we use which is called kali linux<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

629
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:21,919
sure a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people heard of kali linux</font>

630
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:24,860
like security onion<font color="#E5E5E5"> kali linux is just</font>

631
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:27,740
pre packaged with all of the common send

632
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:32,270
testing tools they're all built in again

633
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:34,460
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> more warning please please please do</font>

634
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:37,070
this in a lab environment don't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

635
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,960
testing your bank online even if you

636
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,850
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you haven't written you don't</font>

637
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,810
always have written from all parties

638
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:45,290
either you

639
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:47,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">may have someone at you know or cousins</font>

640
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:48,920
company and he's like oh yeah you could

641
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,560
do that here no it doesn't you need

642
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,690
approval right even if you are in an

643
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,399
engagement with a client and they've

644
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,530
given you a range of ips and they're

645
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,840
like yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want you to you know test</font>

646
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:02,000
these ranges and you've compromised that

647
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,980
you can go to a whole other subnet no

648
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,870
you can't they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you</font>

649
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,600
permission don't do that so it's just

650
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:10,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">easier to learn the stuff on your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

651
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,860
museums and stuff the same goes with the

652
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,360
blue team monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you really</font>

653
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,550
don't want to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what your friends and</font>

654
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,500
family are browsing to on the internet

655
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:20,330
and when you accidentally start

656
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,730
monitoring them like hey this is not

657
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:25,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it it's harmless and passive it's</font>

658
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:28,610
not so harmless to you because you're

659
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:31,850
like oh yeah I now know they owe me<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

660
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:33,949
personally again these are yet some

661
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:36,320
examples there are many warnings out

662
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,420
there you can't possibly do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

663
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,389
without seeing these warnings heat all

664
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:43,580
of them I mean you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> aaron schwartz</font>

665
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:45,590
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the best example of you know a</font>

666
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,330
hacker anything like that but he is a

667
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:50,629
good example where the law really

668
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:51,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">hammered down on a guy based on tons of</font>

669
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:54,290
you know tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different laws they</font>

670
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,580
tried to put on him in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end they went</font>

671
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">through a bunch of legal proceedings</font>

672
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,480
thought it was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be nice and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fine</font>

673
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:02,180
he tried to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a plea agreement they</font>

674
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,660
said no so he hanged himself he's dead

675
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:07,250
now and and all because he he<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

676
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">even doing the stuff that we're talking</font>

677
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">about today which in a minute will be</font>

678
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:14,870
like physically or not physically

679
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,160
attacking somebody but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

680
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:18,439
they perceive it that way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

681
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">to in the end they will crash down on</font>

682
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,240
you very hard and again people are paid

683
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:24,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">to watch this stuff so what is a great</font>

684
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,930
way for you to set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> something at home</font>

685
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,060
and practice well we highly recommend

686
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:30,620
you want to be a red team person knowing

687
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:33,139
the blue team side as well so

688
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:36,560
downloading both<font color="#E5E5E5"> cali and security onion</font>

689
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:39,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit able to is basically just</font>

690
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:41,360
another operating system that is already

691
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,310
vulnerable you just have to turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

692
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,709
and you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an operating system that</font>

693
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:48,290
has a bunch of vulnerable software<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready</font>

694
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:50,930
for you to attack you don't have to do

695
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:53,030
anything just turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so you can you</font>

696
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:55,430
know try try tacking it from your cali

697
00:27:53,030 --> 00:28:00,320
box try monitoring your attack

698
00:27:55,430 --> 00:28:02,300
with your security onion box so typical

699
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,159
pen testing methodology there's

700
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,440
generally you know I've heard different

701
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,880
methodologies but in summary what you're

702
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,070
going to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with is doing you know a</font>

703
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,720
discovery or a mapping of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host that</font>

704
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,070
you're wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compromise so you're</font>

705
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,980
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a networks can</font>

706
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:17,629
see which hosts<font color="#E5E5E5"> are out there you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

707
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,390
what services and ports are available

708
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:21,950
for you to you know attack you're going

709
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:24,800
to do an assessment on them so you'll do

710
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:27,980
some sort of you can do manually

711
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:30,260
vulnerability scan or you could run

712
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,390
scanners or lots of free scanners

713
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:33,800
available then once you find with

714
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:35,750
vulnerable you want to exploit it and

715
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools already on kali</font>

716
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:40,880
linux with exploits ready for you to

717
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:45,770
fire away and then once you've done that

718
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:47,330
you pretty much rinse<font color="#E5E5E5"> and repeat so the</font>

719
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:49,220
discovery phase what is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovery</font>

720
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:51,439
phase again you're mapping what's

721
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:53,600
available let's say you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a pen test</font>

722
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,910
you know they've given you an IP range

723
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,760
you're going to first want to say who's

724
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:00,350
home you know what's out there what's

725
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,960
available for me to attack so you're

726
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:04,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to run probably an nmap scan in</font>

727
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,540
math is one of the most common tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

728
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:09,620
know of<font color="#E5E5E5"> o stands for a network mapper so</font>

729
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,810
basically what you see in this slide

730
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,310
we're scanning a range and we're seeing

731
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:15,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there for hosts that report back</font>

732
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:17,780
and say we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> live on the network</font>

733
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,990
returned on we're home it's basically

734
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:22,730
just rattling some windows see you know

735
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:24,680
who is actually home in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

736
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:26,390
peeking through and<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen what you can do</font>

737
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,240
there are more invasive things that you

738
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:31,430
can do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> test this but this is just a</font>

739
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">very basic thing if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on your home</font>

740
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:35,930
network and salt trusted and you have

741
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,580
everyone's permission you know scanning

742
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:39,590
your home network is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

743
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:43,909
reveal what hosts are actually up in

744
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:45,320
most cases so here we did another in

745
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:48,200
maps can where we basically just said

746
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,570
hey we see that this one host is up scan

747
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,570
the toes tell us what services are

748
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:55,100
turned on what's running in<font color="#E5E5E5"> map can go</font>

749
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:57,350
so far as to guess what version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

750
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:02,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">service is running we highlighted this</font>

751
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:04,399
ftp service at the top VSS PT<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two</font>

752
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,900
point three point four so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of</font>

753
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,210
follow through in our sample so just

754
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,600
note there that you know we scanned that

755
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">ho</font>

756
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,350
we saw that that service was open and

757
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:14,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's an older version of that ftp</font>

758
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:16,389
server if you solve this amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

759
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:18,500
services on a device in your house

760
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:22,100
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be suspicious as oil</font>

761
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:24,530
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again a venerable host that</font>

762
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:27,070
we've set up and so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was made for the</font>

763
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:30,230
purpose of doing some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

764
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:32,120
investigation on and testing again so

765
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">now we've discovered what's there we've</font>

766
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:36,100
mapped it out we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's home we know</font>

767
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:39,800
what's running let's do an assessment

768
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:42,379
open boss is a vulnerability scanner and

769
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,659
you can basically just sign up<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's on</font>

770
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,430
kali linux of course I you can put in

771
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:49,370
the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address and it will run through</font>

772
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:52,220
and do kind of an invasive assessment

773
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:54,320
for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> never mind the cartoons but</font>

774
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:57,410
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> let that fool you it's removing</font>

775
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,200
bedroom a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> use tools like</font>

776
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:02,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">nests and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few other tools like that many</font>

777
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">of those have gotten very very</font>

778
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,189
commercial over time because they're all

779
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:10,459
quite good but open boss is<font color="#CCCCCC"> still</font>

780
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:12,740
completely free the cartoons may seem

781
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:15,770
like it's light-hearted but it is very

782
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:18,320
serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> and will very much help you out</font>

783
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:21,200
on compromising house so here's a result

784
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:24,740
from this scan for that host I think you

785
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,870
can simply highlight the there should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

786
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,940
a finding for the ftp server on here but

787
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:31,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically you know it spits out a result</font>

788
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:32,990
saying hey here's what here's what open

789
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:35,300
boss found these are the services that

790
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:38,390
we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> are running here's how severe</font>

791
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:40,970
this exploit is it gives you a guess at

792
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:44,570
how likely they think their test was to

793
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:47,750
be accurate<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we found them where's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

794
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:49,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">at it's about a little bit lower okay</font>

795
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,660
it's kind of in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mid screen but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

796
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,850
says hey we think there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety-nine</font>

797
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:55,700
percent chance that this is actually a

798
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:57,409
legitimate thing that we can exploit if

799
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,960
you click into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> again it tells you</font>

800
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:02,570
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we found it's this version</font>

801
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,310
and it's affected there's an exploit

802
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,350
available there's references at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

803
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:08,899
bottom you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go study about why that</font>

804
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:11,840
was vulnerable we do each<font color="#CCCCCC"> time a totally</font>

805
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:13,550
they won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense at first but over</font>

806
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,899
time these things will make<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and</font>

807
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:17,450
more sense you'll see that they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

808
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,309
and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> common it's like oh well you</font>

809
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:21,679
know some sort of

810
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:26,090
you know this vulnerability you know

811
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:29,210
figure out what the terminology is and

812
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:31,158
you can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave it at all okay</font>

813
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:33,049
well basically we're moving on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

814
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:35,840
exploitation phase so now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found our</font>

815
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:37,418
vulnerability and now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to exploit</font>

816
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,240
it we know that it's vulnerable

817
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:43,820
metasploit is their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> premature</font>

818
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">metasploit okay so metasploit this is</font>

819
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,749
NSF console which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like the</font>

820
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:51,980
interface to<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit on the command</font>

821
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:53,539
line there we go so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we power</font>

822
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,399
it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we say hey let's search</font>

823
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:57,080
through your database and tell me if you

824
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:58,758
already have an exploit built for me

825
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,860
because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to create</font>

826
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:02,119
malware yet I'm just starting tell me if

827
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a next point in here so we</font>

828
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:06,259
searched through and sure enough there's

829
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,240
a an exploit already saved in its

830
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:10,159
database ready all you have to do is

831
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,080
tailor it to your host that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

832
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,360
attack so summarize<font color="#CCCCCC"> meta sports and</font>

833
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,460
exploitation framework that ranking kick

834
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,110
up and chances are it's probably going

835
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for most things that</font>

836
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:22,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">open boss is going to report back to you</font>

837
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:23,450
socially it's like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high risk you know</font>

838
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">none of your numbers and chances</font>

839
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,499
vulnerable you're probably to find

840
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:29,629
something in in<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit for it even</font>

841
00:33:27,499 --> 00:33:31,309
if it's a pretty modern<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will be able</font>

842
00:33:29,629 --> 00:33:38,360
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find it online or be able to load it</font>

843
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:40,340
in now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> exploit it so here we go we've</font>

844
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,258
selected our exploit we tailor it to fit

845
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,299
the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're attacking it</font>

846
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:46,399
runs the exploit we see some stp

847
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:48,019
commands and then bottom line we see

848
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,809
that we have a command shell session

849
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:53,570
opened between their hosts and ours so

850
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:56,299
we have command line access to that host

851
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:58,460
we run the ID command and it tells us

852
00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:01,070
that we have the privilege of root user

853
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:05,559
so we have root level access on that box

854
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:10,190
so basically you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want for that box</font>

855
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:13,069
so victory so yeah celebration right but

856
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:16,250
but not so fast because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not so easy</font>

857
00:34:13,069 --> 00:34:17,779
if you are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad guy and you're</font>

858
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:20,270
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use the all these</font>

859
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:23,260
tricks for money and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll Rob</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

860
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:26,000
basically because just the exploit alone

861
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:29,349
which was about three lines you typed

862
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,149
about three lines still made 14 events

863
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:33,999
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> attack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blue team guy</font>

864
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:37,009
or gal who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is watch</font>

865
00:34:33,998 --> 00:34:39,709
suddenly like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I see what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font>

866
00:34:37,009 --> 00:34:41,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">here we have that honey pot or that</font>

867
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:44,319
vulnerable hosts that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we put out there</font>

868
00:34:41,509 --> 00:34:46,789
on our network somebody compromise that

869
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:49,248
let's let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what's going on here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

870
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:51,980
they were they were also internal which

871
00:34:49,248 --> 00:34:55,038
is would be a fun day for that person

872
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:58,549
they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> love them so let's put the</font>

873
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:01,130
hammer down but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even more so it was only</font>

874
00:34:58,549 --> 00:35:03,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">after you made a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more alerts with</font>

875
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:06,319
your scan your skin was very very very

00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:08,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">loud this is just one page of these I</font>

877
00:35:06,319 --> 00:35:09,769
don't expect you to read everything but

878
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:11,450
your skin look for all kinds of

879
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:12,890
vulnerabilities and as it looks for

880
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:15,200
those a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are very very</font>

881
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:18,410
invasive that that we will see those on

882
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:21,109
the network to the point where just your

883
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:24,558
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> user aging your identifier there's</font>

884
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:27,619
open boss we saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that at least 50,000</font>

885
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:30,319
times so there were there were roughly a

886
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:31,910
hundred thousand alerts in total that we

887
00:35:30,319 --> 00:35:34,788
saw these<font color="#E5E5E5"> they just showed up here so</font>

888
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:36,710
your scan which seemed benign and your

889
00:35:34,789 --> 00:35:38,960
your exploitation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed easy</font>

890
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:41,299
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> generated over a hundred</font>

891
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,519
thousand alerts and someone got probably

892
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:46,460
mad on the blue team they're like oh god

893
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:50,868
this guy using so many alerts we have to

894
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:53,269
close out sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is ridiculous so in</font>

895
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:55,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">conclusion you know it's it didn't seem</font>

896
00:35:53,269 --> 00:35:57,258
<font color="#E5E5E5">all that bad right there there's a lot</font>

897
00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:01,579
to learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's pretty structured once</font>

898
00:35:57,259 --> 00:36:04,400
you once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a focus it's all quite</font>

899
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:07,009
fun once you get used to it at first it

900
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,299
may seem overburdening it may seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

901
00:36:07,009 --> 00:36:10,099
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult especially if you're</font>

902
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:11,960
alone and learning it but you're not

903
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:14,900
alone in learning if you'll reach out to

904
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,789
people like don't feel so so shy that

905
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't reach out to people online or</font>

in person people give talks like this

quite a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> at different conferences</font>

something and reference you to somebody

919
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:46,489
to summarize the blue team stuff is

920
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:47,660
collection<font color="#E5E5E5"> as extras analysis we do</font>

921
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:50,329
surveillance work

922
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:52,160
then we try to detect bad stuff we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

923
00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:54,410
care about monitoring good stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,118
most part<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside of knowing what is a</font>

00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:58,190
critical asset or what is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

926
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:59,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">valuable thing on the network we care</font>

927
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:02,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that stuff because we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

928
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">defend against it anything attacking all</font>

929
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,980
that we do detection based on those

930
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:08,808
alerting that that's what actually

931
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,700
catches the baddies but then you have a

932
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:13,130
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> thousand alerts to go through or</font>

933
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:16,069
we do analysis and we say this was the

934
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:19,039
actual exploitation again 100,000 alerts

935
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:21,500
only 14 of those made up an actual

936
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:23,420
export to compromise the host so it's a

937
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,819
matter verifying that there was a

938
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:27,349
compromise host not just the Santos

939
00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:29,089
because on the internet if you're

940
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:32,089
exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet everyone is</font>

941
00:37:29,089 --> 00:37:34,430
scanning you all the time so red team

942
00:37:32,089 --> 00:37:36,020
people again we're doing the opposite

943
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:37,848
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're doing is to support and</font>

944
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,829
help companies not because we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

945
00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:42,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">just so good about our pin testing tools</font>

946
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:44,270
you know you're wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help the</font>

947
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:46,578
company by testing the resources that

948
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:48,470
they gave you permission to test you're

949
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:49,760
going to do as quietly as possible so

950
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:52,459
that blue team doesn't detect you

951
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,619
because you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make what a</font>

952
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:57,049
legitimate attacker would do you know

953
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:59,000
most attacks you know people have months

954
00:37:57,049 --> 00:38:00,440
and years to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on breaking into</font>

955
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,359
something whereas when you have a pin

956
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,039
test you may just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a week or two to</font>

957
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:07,160
do your<font color="#CCCCCC"> job so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do the best</font>

958
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:10,339
job you can be very thorough you know

959
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,750
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> the methodology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of discovering you</font>

960
00:38:10,339 --> 00:38:14,119
know what what's out there what do they

00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,589
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've tested some companies that you</font>

know we're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey we see you have all</font>

963
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:18,680
this stuff running and they're like we

964
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,930
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about that every company</font>

965
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">Morgan like even that phase is very</font>

966
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,470
important you know what do you see

967
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,839
running and being very<font color="#E5E5E5"> thorough about</font>

968
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:28,788
that doing a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> assessment of it</font>

969
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:30,020
what's vulnerable some companies don't

970
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:32,359
want you to exploit things they just

971
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:34,779
want you to do a really good Filner

972
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:36,890
ability scan and then tell them hey

973
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:38,900
here's what we found here's what's for

974
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:40,190
ball you need to patch these things we

975
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how severe they are</font>

976
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:44,660
or if it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be exploited so maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

977
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:46,609
stop there then other people do<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you</font>

978
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and say we really want to</font>

979
00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:50,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">prove to the guys upstairs that this is</font>

980
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:53,329
bad stuff so make this as bad as you can

981
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:55,640
exploit everything on our network show

982
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:57,700
how bad this could really get and that

983
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:01,009
helps you know usually the security team

984
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:03,080
get funding for more tools

985
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:04,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">your detection you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> giving us go right</font>

986
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,740
you don't figure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out on your own is</font>

987
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,050
like I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to own everybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

988
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:10,879
give you a scope<font color="#CCCCCC"> brand new you stick to</font>

989
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:12,620
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> again it goes about permission even</font>

990
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,540
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have permission don't go too</font>

991
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:19,490
crazy i´m so and I guess lastly the

992
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,840
other stuff here is that you know I

993
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:23,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compliance administration</font>

994
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,800
briefly in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning and even though</font>

995
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,420
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't doing the blinds or</font>

996
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,060
administration<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know a ton of people</font>

997
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:30,560
who are they they do keep everything

998
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:33,170
running they are the ones who are

999
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,810
actually trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce that attack</font>

1000
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:37,520
surface all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time they're keeping</font>

1001
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:40,990
your company legal they're keeping your

1002
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:43,910
security department intact they are

1003
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:46,100
while we talked about operations this

1004
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:47,569
later you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could talk for days on</font>

1005
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,790
compliance and days on administration

1006
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:50,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">really and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the main point is</font>

1007
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:53,270
that everybody's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work together</font>

1008
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,220
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like yeah red team's really</font>

1009
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:57,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool kind of portrayed as the sexier</font>

1010
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:59,839
side of security your hacker and it's so

1011
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:02,870
cool but the blue team is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1012
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,970
important and I've played both roles so

1013
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:07,279
far and I can honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that by being</font>

1014
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:09,620
a red team person it made me much better

1015
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,450
as a blue team person now when I see a

1016
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:13,790
scan I'm like I've any pretension of

1017
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,080
those like you know I kind of have you

1018
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,580
know you can kind of see<font color="#CCCCCC"> both</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> role so</font>

1019
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,200
you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's important</font>

1020
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,600
they're the same coin just two sides of

1021
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:24,049
it and the main goal is to protect data

1022
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:26,690
so so how do you actually get a job

1023
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:29,420
doing this you don't want to go into

1024
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:32,930
interviews and feel very nervous because

1025
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:36,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't know anything you can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> expect</font>

1026
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:38,000
in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases to get a job and then</font>

1027
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:40,370
start learning that's the thing about

1028
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,710
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> security is that there are a</font>

1029
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:45,830
few jobs available to<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are not</font>

1030
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:47,660
are not currently skilled and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1031
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:49,400
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> when a place is hiring it's</font>

1032
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:51,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they have no one or they have no</font>

1033
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,450
one skilled currently so don't expect to

1034
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:55,910
even go to a place if you get that job

1035
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:58,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">and be able to easily learn your key is</font>

1036
00:40:55,910 --> 00:41:00,710
actually taking it and trying to make a

1037
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:03,170
passion out of it and a lot of times

1038
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,760
again that comes to knowing somebody

1039
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,440
else and<font color="#E5E5E5"> train like bring people</font>

1040
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,150
together to maybe learn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you</font>

1041
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,720
because it's so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier to stay on</font>

1042
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:13,850
it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that search they're great</font>

1043
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,919
but they'll get and they'll get you

1044
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:17,750
through the door to an interview but

1045
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,700
don't roll on<font color="#CCCCCC"> isert don't think that you</font>

1046
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:21,860
can say oh well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could either learn</font>

1047
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,169
this on my own for you know weeks and

1048
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:27,020
months at a time or I can do this week

1049
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:28,720
course and be done like it takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

1050
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:31,220
than a week to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1051
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,600
usually people anyway don't have the

1052
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,310
money for those week courses when they

1053
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,950
start out they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually in a job</font>

1054
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:38,299
anyway so good experience to add on to

1055
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:40,009
what he was saying about like you know

1056
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,990
when you're researching jobs you know

1057
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,610
and they they have like 15 to 20 bullets

1058
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:45,740
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went somebody that can do this</font>

1059
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:47,690
business and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I've interviewed for</font>

1060
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:49,549
many roles where I look I may be only

1061
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:51,740
knew like three to five of those bullets

1062
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:53,840
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I felt like a moderately confident I</font>

1063
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:55,430
can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about these things that's okay</font>

1064
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,050
most people just you know a lot of

1065
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,730
people are posting they want a superstar

1066
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:00,080
that can do everything that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

1067
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that can do</font>

1068
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,230
five<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things really well they</font>

1069
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,820
understand I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like our community</font>

1070
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:07,250
knows like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to find</font>

1071
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody that just knows all of it</font>

1072
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,220
there's way too much to know and I do

1073
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:12,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the community is very</font>

1074
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:14,299
understanding so don't let<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hold you</font>

1075
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,830
back from applying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> jobs that are</font>

1076
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,360
interesting to you because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will get</font>

1077
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:18,650
there it just takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get up that</font>

1078
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,470
learning curve and maybe most

1079
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:24,800
importantly it's good to make this a

1080
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:26,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">career if you really jump into and spend</font>

1081
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,400
all this time especially if you're in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1082
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:30,320
job and you have to learn this after

1083
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,510
work and you're spending nice and stuff

1084
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,550
just make it make it a career start

1085
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:37,160
going to you're already<font color="#CCCCCC"> here so it's</font>

1086
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:38,450
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good sign but contribute at</font>

1087
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,120
these sides things like that they always

1088
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:43,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">need help you know if you liked code</font>

1089
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,350
take on a security project that's a

1090
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">great way to get really interested to</font>

1091
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:50,270
get other people interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in you in</font>

1092
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:52,220
the community as well and once you you

1093
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:54,259
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you grow forward maybe either</font>

1094
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:56,029
contribute or start a technical block

1095
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:57,260
maybe nobody will read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you'll</font>

1096
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,820
have been blogging things and actually

1097
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,680
later on down the road you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

1098
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:04,730
look back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and like I remember when I was</font>

1099
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:15,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and it'll be good so</font>

1100
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:18,890
questions anybody yes so yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

1101
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:22,190
they're on lid<font color="#E5E5E5"> pcap specifically that's</font>

1102
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:28,490
a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you think Chris</font>

1103
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:31,190
when I am I looking at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rato</font>

whatever it was a hierarchical ps4

1108
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:48,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would say he doesn't</font>

1109
00:43:40,940 --> 00:44:00,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily matter so much get a</font>

1110
00:43:48,050 --> 00:44:03,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">question so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question was if you're a</font>

1111
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:07,970
hacker and<font color="#E5E5E5"> visible if a blue team person</font>

1112
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:09,319
can they find you based on IP so this

1113
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:11,899
can actually be this will be a fun

1114
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:14,870
political question so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about</font>

1115
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:16,850
Russia things like that so all these

1116
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:18,710
hackers no hacking campaigns here and

1117
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:21,110
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that the other it's quite</font>

1118
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:23,960
challenging sometimes if you're a very

1119
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:25,640
very skilled attacker it'll be it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1120
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:29,030
challenging for a blue team person to

1121
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:31,549
guarantee 100% accuracy that yes this

1122
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:33,950
person is from Russia that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they didn't</font>

1123
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:35,660
like you said he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> scrambled or a lot</font>

1124
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:37,939
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people with it is a crock see around</font>

1125
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:40,370
so I may be in the US like I may be

1126
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:42,890
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and I'm a you know by some</font>

1127
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:44,210
proxy which means i route my traffic

1128
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:46,009
they see through another place and then

1129
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:48,230
through another place and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I attack</font>

1130
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:49,880
from there well from most blue team

1131
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:52,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">burrs perspectives especially if you</font>

1132
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have access to a ton of Intel or a</font>

1133
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:56,419
ton of connections you know outside of

1134
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:57,980
some very large organizations it's going

1135
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:00,140
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be hard for the random person to be</font>

1136
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:01,580
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I bet they actually they were</font>

1137
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,290
here because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to look like</font>

1138
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:07,640
Russia it's going to look like Ukraine

1139
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:10,160
or somewhere like that so yeah right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1140
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:11,540
so yeah it's very hard to confirm its

1141
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,850
the source that you're seeing is

1142
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:16,190
actually that source but the good news

1143
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:18,650
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the blue team perspective is it not</font>

1144
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:20,900
everyone is that smart and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

1145
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:23,750
places as far as like running those down

1146
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:25,820
it's still nothing this like if your

1147
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:28,430
question is actually can actually do

1148
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:31,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">this and make some money by proxying for</font>

1149
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:34,009
Ukraine maybe for a while but I wouldn't

1150
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:35,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">recommend it in a pen testing like</font>

1151
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:37,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">engagement where you know</font>

1152
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:39,569
companies paid you to come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually</font>

1153
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:41,519
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the pen testers will give the</font>

1154
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:43,410
company like like I was testing from my

1155
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,868
house so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just gave them my home IP</font>

1156
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:48,420
address that away the blue team like

1157
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:49,920
usually they won't tell you know the

1158
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,180
blue team people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pin test is</font>

1159
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,069
happening they'll wait and see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they</font>

1160
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,690
catch<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but normally like we'll go</font>

1161
00:45:53,069 --> 00:45:56,308
ahead and give<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody or a P addresses</font>

1162
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:58,559
when they do detect it they have a way

1163
00:45:56,309 --> 00:46:00,630
to say okay well let's confirm<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1164
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:02,400
not a legitimate attack okay yeah we

1165
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:04,650
paid this company to come in you know

1166
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,349
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way they know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was you know</font>

1167
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:14,700
something they they<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not not a</font>

1168
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:16,200
true attack on their environment how

1169
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,379
often would it come up that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1170
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">dealing with production servers in work</font>

1171
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:23,880
so hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is rare that you're</font>

1172
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:26,368
actually doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything in theory yeah</font>

1173
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:30,029
you should not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that very often</font>

1174
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:31,529
but women detection<font color="#E5E5E5"> in perspective you</font>

1175
00:46:30,029 --> 00:46:33,630
should always<font color="#E5E5E5"> be monitoring things in</font>

1176
00:46:31,529 --> 00:46:35,670
production that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for from a pen</font>

1177
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:38,009
testing perspective it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1178
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:40,170
it is you know when you exploit things

1179
00:46:38,009 --> 00:46:42,450
sometimes we take several soon we may

1180
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:44,910
request that they use something that's

1181
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:46,859
in their QA environment so that you know

1182
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:49,078
they'll just you know make a backup copy

1183
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:50,910
and let us attack that it really depends

1184
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:53,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what the resources and how important</font>

1185
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:55,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is you know or we've had companies</font>

1186
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,779
that request hey we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to do a big</font>

1187
00:46:55,499 --> 00:46:59,368
vulnerability scan but<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes that</font>

1188
00:46:57,779 --> 00:47:01,230
can hurt the bandwidth they're really

1189
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:02,549
taking you know take them offline so

1190
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:04,470
they may request to do that at night

1191
00:47:02,549 --> 00:47:09,599
time so that way they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have time to</font>

1192
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:11,609
recover if there's an issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah right</font>

1193
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,739
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things in a pen test they are</font>

1194
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:15,598
very thorough like you know they talk

1195
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:18,269
back and forth they get a very clear

1196
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,099
line of water what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our scope of our</font>

1197
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:22,258
<font color="#E5E5E5">engagement and we do not grow a lot of</font>

1198
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:24,089
that scope but that's a consulting<font color="#CCCCCC"> pin</font>

1199
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:26,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">test company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to that they do this all</font>

1200
00:47:24,089 --> 00:47:28,170
the time there are some companies who

1201
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:30,539
have like one red team guy and maybe

1202
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:32,069
it's a you know this person has like

1203
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:34,140
just started learning or something like

1204
00:47:32,069 --> 00:47:36,029
that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> like hey can you do a</font>

1205
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:37,379
vulnerability test against all of our

1206
00:47:36,029 --> 00:47:39,539
stuff and maybe it's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of old</font>

1207
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:41,430
legacy things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> next thing you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1208
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:43,289
they're bringing down some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1209
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:44,759
network equipment like I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

1210
00:47:43,289 --> 00:47:46,619
this happened of course you don't you

1211
00:47:44,759 --> 00:47:47,760
just started like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really can't be</font>

1212
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:50,070
secular know

1213
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,740
yeah but like yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's on the</font>

1214
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:54,420
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes to know the stuff but</font>

1215
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:56,490
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> it comes down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fight not many</font>

1216
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:58,020
companies have that knowledge so that's

1217
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:59,580
why a lot of times they go to consulting

1218
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:01,530
companies because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean these are</font>

1219
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:12,600
companies that are entirely made up of

1220
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:14,430
people who know the stuff right you know

1221
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,110
we tried to but all of his blue shirts

1222
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:17,730

00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:27,210
clothes I've know what is this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

there's no more questions yeah we will

1234
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:18,570
give away<font color="#E5E5E5"> some stuff yeah okay so I'll</font>

1238
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:31,500
hold it oh how did the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vanna so this is</font>

1239
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:36,590
practical packet analysis by chris

1240
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:36,590
sanders this is version 3 it is flawless

1241
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:43,430
that's right it comes with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a rural</font>

00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology fund card in here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1243
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:48,109
they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones who have pushed this</font>

1244
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:49,760
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> rule technology fund again</font>

1245
00:49:48,109 --> 00:49:52,160
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> already heard me probably before</font>

1246
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the talk but they are an organization a</font>

1247
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,600
nonprofit that goes around and<font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font>

1248
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,640
sure they<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that rural schools</font>

1249
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,170
and rural<font color="#CCCCCC"> areas have the opportunities</font>

1250
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,350
or at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> close to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the opportunities</font>

1251
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:04,970
that more urban schools have a lot of

1252
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:07,009
urban schools have tons of funding

1253
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:09,230
sometimes too much funding that they

1254
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:12,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">they know even know what to do with this</font>

1255
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:15,740
is a means of giving rural areas you

1256
00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:17,420
know 3d printers and you know labs of

1257
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:19,970
Chromebooks and things like that anytime

1258
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:22,040
yeah raspberry PI's if they have a need

1259
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:24,680
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's a need for like a</font>

1260
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,900
dispersed classroom chances are the rule

1261
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,910
technology fund can provide especially

1262
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:30,440
if they reach out there's means of

1263
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:33,080
reaching out to the real technology fund

1264
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:35,150
if you're with a rural school or

1265
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,529
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a means</font>

1266
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:39,619
of recommending you can reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1267
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:43,030
directly to them and they will hopefully

1268
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:46,790
