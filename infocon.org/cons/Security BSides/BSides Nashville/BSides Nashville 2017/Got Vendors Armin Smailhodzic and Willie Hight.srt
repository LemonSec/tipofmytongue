00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:53,140
definitely one that has pretty much

53
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:56,260
captivated the eyes of leadership and of

00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,029

important part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your day so alarming</font>

59
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,510
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I joined information security I</font>

60
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,738
actually started in physics so a

61
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:19,450
bachelor's and<font color="#E5E5E5"> master's in physics</font>

62
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:22,330
there's a teaching<font color="#CCCCCC"> before this so f kind</font>

63
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,768
of bored so I decided hey security looks

64
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:27,040
pretty cool i'll join impersonation

65
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:29,680
security I'm got chains on the

66
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,420
administration compliance side luckily

67
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,400
teaching is just like dealing with

68
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,329
grownups they always bigger and you have

69
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,370
to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to make them</font>

70
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,630
interested in what you're saying so the

71
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,130
best way to make people interested is

72
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,930
hey this is how much money we could

73
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">potentially lose if something happens</font>

74
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,989
with this vendor so start with

75
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:48,970
complected ministration moved over to

76
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:52,590
the sock but still work a lot on the

77
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,590
vendor security side of things

78
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:07,489
the wily here sometimes vendors we think

79
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,909
about vendors we just thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

80
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:13,400
like partners people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually</font>

81
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:17,719
physically show up and physically have

82
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,548
access to your facility there are so

83
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,729
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suppliers now there's a</font>

84
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:24,679
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who are at companies that</font>

85
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:27,520
are mid size too large they uses what we

86
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,949
call<font color="#CCCCCC"> T cards or purchase cards and</font>

87
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,719
they're engaging in vendor relationships

88
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:35,419
without going through the proper process

89
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,949
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they take the card</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

90
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:41,120
get a software as a service agreement

91
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:43,940
and all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden now your data is in</font>

92
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,110
many places that you have an authorized

93
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:50,060
because they have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

94
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:52,280
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of implications to that as</font>

95
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,580
we would be violating our own policies

96
00:04:52,280 --> 00:05:00,020
but we also are if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing with</font>

97
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:02,359
customers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you deal with other like</font>

98
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,880
partners you actually have to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

99
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,620
that your policies your procedures the

100
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,409
things that you adhere to these<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors</font>

101
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:12,560
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> like 82 and you'll find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

102
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:15,349
your vendors have vendors and you have

103
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,860
to ensure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lenders adhere to</font>

104
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:23,659
that and doing that is definitely like

105
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:25,490
not a small feat at all so there's so

106
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:29,330
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> different areas where we could be</font>

107
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:34,159
financially responsible we could have a

108
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:37,310
bad situation where our name is just you

109
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:40,789
know downtrodden<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of how we are</font>

110
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,979
engaging and not actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the</font>

111
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:46,460
vendors to adhere to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff we're not</font>

112
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:48,409
enforcing rules than legal impacts that

113
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,000
are involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but contractual</font>

114
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:51,940
obligations that's again back to the

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,080
customer thing in a human safety

116
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,740
sometimes you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what that's</font>

117
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,690
our greatest

118
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask that too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

119
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,550
last days we consider and think about

120
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:07,400
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go into these engagements</font>

121
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:10,490
because you money is what talks let's

122
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,080
jump into example so how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

123
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:18,139
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your company purchases</font>

124
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:19,460
software from anybody how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

125
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:21,440
know what questions you're asking those

126
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,090
awkward vendors or do you ask them

127
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,880
anything or like Willie said hey here's

128
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:31,460
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pcard let me about 50,000 licenses or</font>

129
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:33,409
whatever this is so if you were talking

130
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,318
to this software wonder what kind of

131
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:37,610
questions you would you ask like motor

132
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:55,639
important questions for you to know

133
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:59,419
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that vendor anybody because I'm</font>

134
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:02,419
tired people and is exceeding to realize

135
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get questions about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our spirit if</font>

136
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:08,169
it's quite a<font color="#CCCCCC"> common see that like the</font>

137
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:10,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea tech question you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

138
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:14,000
organization security questions from

139
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:16,638
<font color="#CCCCCC">arbys night and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really I believe</font>

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,940
that's because like this is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not new</font>

141
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,500
but you know we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> engaging with I</font>

142
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,020
build a relationship other people to

00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:27,650
expand and enhance you know the

144
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:30,979
practices but it what is it was that you

145
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:33,799
know I a company was held responsible

146
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:38,270
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a cell company a</font>

147
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:42,500
business associate did and that had

148
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:45,710
financial implications and that begins

149
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:49,639
to scare people and companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> when they</font>

150
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:53,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay something that I'm</font>

151
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:55,190
attached to could actually ruin my

152
00:07:53,630 --> 00:08:00,009
reputation could actually ruin

153
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:02,300
relationships and possibly even you know

154
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:06,259
have criminal

155
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:11,120
you know consequences to it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

156
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:12,830
of that there's hundreds is not you know

157
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,650
depending on the size of organization

158
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,900
thousands of vendors that pre-exists

159
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,388
this whole process what we call vendor

160
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,770
security today and it's not common for

161
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:24,289
them to ask you about your security

162
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:26,240
policy because it's like oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> just what</font>

163
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:29,030
you're selling work that's what their

164
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,099
focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's like and from a business</font>

166
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:36,019
business and these business leaders said

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,899
hey carbon<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is what we need let's do</font>

their so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to find clever ways to</font>

176
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,680
like build a relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you and</font>

177
00:08:55,459 --> 00:09:00,439
at the same time evaluate you and do it

178
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:09,979
in a manner that's not going to be too

179
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:12,079
imposing alright so as open as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you said</font>

180
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:20,200
you guys don't you security questions

181
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:23,930
aren't really asked of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> larkin and</font>

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:27,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm getting art piece for when we're</font>

doing engaging new customers level

184
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:34,620
it's less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> a percent of the time</font>

185
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:37,510
that I felt awkward hilariously

186
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:42,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">dangerous this software that you sell is</font>

187
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:44,830
it just like off right like<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

188
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,380
to have D like a option for own

189
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:50,140
pregnancy and of options for cloud do

190
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,760
you do you have a maintenance agreements

191
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,400
that comes along with it would you ever

192
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,260
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have access to the facilities or</font>

193
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,640
like the hardware or software<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

194
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:03,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">work so software companies are not</font>

195
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually what that at the vendor but when</font>

196
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,209
we get into engagement where you

197
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,910
actually let's say higher carbon block

198
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,960
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement this they're paying</font>

199
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,490
them for that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need</font>

200
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,740
network access they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need</font>

201
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:18,270
access to your facility and it's like oh

202
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:20,940
you know we think it's a quick install

203
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:24,520
but our customers don't think that way

204
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,960
if it doesn't take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way they have to</font>

205
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">have background checks for our employees</font>

206
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:32,380
so why would we stop when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get a</font>

207
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:35,590
third party in place a software person

208
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:38,020
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> only they're not HP they're</font>

209
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:40,030
not consultants that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

210
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:43,630
work on on behalf it's not augmentation

211
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:46,569
this is software but software comes with

212
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:49,990
people and needs and sometimes those

213
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:52,120
these impose on your territory and so we

214
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:55,330
have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> just as visual to protect</font>

215
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:59,890
just like we do with people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are</font>

216
00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:02,560
directly hire any other questions so

217
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:05,290
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vendor's point of view hardly any</font>

218
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,390
security questions I've ever asked so as

219
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:16,540
a business what what would you like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

220
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:23,890
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about your software</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vendor that</font>

221
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:27,510

222
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,510
then we're losing energy in a

is a public comment and one question get

three months and did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind response</font>

238
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:46,140
requirement yeah sometimes it does just

239
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:53,149
ship and sometimes you work in community

240
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:53,149
rotation yes this record is good

241
00:12:54,050 --> 00:13:02,399
honestly I get a love that vendor but

242
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:05,279
also that vendors settled build interior

<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft us</font>

244
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:12,839
on one side but another thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

245
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:23,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting is changing like two years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> felt</font>

246
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:31,740
very deep but last year half of

247
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:34,829
engagements and this year and then the

248
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:37,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">level pressure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is changing you guys are</font>

249
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:39,628
<font color="#CCCCCC">here Harry noticing our new rules</font>

250
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:42,498
constantly changing is getting warmed up

251
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:46,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was probably four years ago I</font>

252
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:48,629
minute health place for five years the

253
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,850
process happened one year after so that

254
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:56,579
our process is only four years old I

255
00:13:50,850 --> 00:14:00,540
think loud was not a big forerunner our

256
00:13:56,579 --> 00:14:03,209
discussion piece in the beginning it was

257
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,189
more of are you really a network access

258
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:08,518
are you going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need facility access</font>

259
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:10,199
and just talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your actual security</font>

260
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,959
posture like what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> your team look like</font>

261
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:18,449
what is your<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy posture look like</font>

262
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:21,180
for now let's see like 2014-2015 it

263
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:24,149
became more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more of a requirement</font>

264
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:26,219
you know we sometimes do things because

265
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:28,920
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry expanded and in other</font>

266
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:32,069
times we do things because some of the

267
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:37,819
people there you know providing the most

268
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:40,589
income to us that big deal that big

269
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:43,378
relationship that you have they require

270
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:45,839
so you know we weren't required d hi

271
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:49,800
trust factors wouldn't even have been in

272
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,699
a vocabulary but you know anthem and the

273
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,500
different ones that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

274
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:54,508
relationships with that they required

275
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">itself like now we require and now we</font>

276
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:57,529
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to require our vendors to require</font>

277
00:14:55,949 --> 00:15:04,040
and we want them to require there

278
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:06,319
to require and it's not really so it's

279
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:10,719
it's definitely changing and I think

280
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:13,759
many of that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the the intense</font>

281
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:18,860
attention in auditing that's happening

282
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:23,540
from HS age of 80<font color="#CCCCCC"> tesco whatever it's</font>

283
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:27,050
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the big things that we see in</font>

284
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:32,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">the news like no one no one wants to</font>

285
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:39,949
have to work out 10 20 million dollars

286
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:42,829
just to satisfy some sort of like breach

287
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:47,420
and then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rebuild your whole</font>

288
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:49,300
reputation is there that 10 or 12

289
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:52,009
million dollars this is the beginning

290
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:54,910
it's not even talking about all the

291
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:57,949
forensic<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs that you had all of the</font>

292
00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:00,079
work workers that you have you know

293
00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:01,910
working on this internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

294
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,019
corrective actions it's like you can

295
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">that let's say it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten-million-dollar</font>

296
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:07,939
briefs but by the time it's all over and

297
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:09,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm if you look at the past cost and the</font>

298
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:11,480
future costs and all the requirements

299
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:13,899
that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 100 hundred and</font>

300
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:17,449
twenty million dollars if you're not

301
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:20,509
making a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of revenue I could</font>

302
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:22,189
close shop and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> why people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

303
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:25,220
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're asking all these extra</font>

304
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:27,649
questions and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

305
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,029
responsibilities more and more on the

306
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:36,050
people who actually have these

307
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:38,139
relationships so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a set of sample</font>

308
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:40,670
questions that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked our vendors</font>

309
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:42,769
don't lead into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big three questions</font>

310
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,089
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked so one of the key</font>

311
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:47,779
questions that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know is are</font>

315
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:59,540
if you're going to access our data we

316
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:02,089
need to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you some more questions so</font>

321
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,209
a couple of contractors how long is that

322
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:17,860
contract going to last hello so like you

323
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:21,070
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussing earlier if we hosted</font>

324
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:22,958
<font color="#E5E5E5">time if you're hosting it or if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

325
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:24,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">you to come and install it for us how</font>

326
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,050
long is that going to take what kind of

327
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:29,169
background checks do you do on your

328
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:33,850
people what kind of training do you give

329
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:36,520
those people so<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it a</font>

330
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:38,260
software-as-a-service pull any third

331
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,440
party or external software admin access

332
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,450
be required so at that point we'll also

333
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,810
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start including you in our audit</font>

334
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,980
process so every quarter we're like a

335
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,720
cable these are the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

336
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,780
access to this from the external<font color="#CCCCCC"> side</font>

337
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,340
will reach out to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will ask a or any</font>

338
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,770
of these people no longer on this

339
00:17:54,340 --> 00:18:00,010
contract yet so we can remove their

340
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:01,870
access also<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our contract will</font>

341
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,640
actually include hey we need you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let</font>

342
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,800
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when someone has terminated that</font>

343
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,450
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> working for us or on our contract so</font>

344
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:13,000
we can remove all their access

345
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:15,130
immediately also is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've come into a</font>

346
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,900
lot lately people are buying freeware or

347
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">open source software things like that I</font>

348
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,890
can just install this it's free I don't

349
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,410
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you i have this so it's</font>

350
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:25,210
getting in touch with our developers

351
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,620
because well usually developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

352
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:29,320
first people to install tools and try

353
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:31,419
them out so it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey guys you even</font>

354
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,950
if it's free we still need you<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell us</font>

355
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:36,550
as much information as you can about

356
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:38,650
this you install something it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

357
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:41,370
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer have support like centos 05</font>

358
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:43,750
that last week<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a week before like hey</font>

359
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,379
you hope you might still have this why

360
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,490
like we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about this until</font>

361
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,170
we're looking through the network maybe

362
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:52,210
doing like an internal tentacle there's

363
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:55,570
like 15 of these servers out here for

364
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:59,200
some reason and our little<font color="#E5E5E5"> group was</font>

365
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:01,270
identified that even though it's it's

366
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">like freeware open source and sometimes</font>

367
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:06,610
it's just that if you're doing it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

368
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:09,460
small<font color="#E5E5E5"> level but they're like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Enterprise</font>

369
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">inversions and it's like yeah I was free</font>

370
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:14,669
until

371
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:18,570
and now it's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for you by the</font>

372
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:20,240
way we're taking you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to court so yeah</font>

373
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,590
that's another reason why you just want

374
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,970
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys toss on your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> teeth and</font>

375
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:29,158
ensure it is what it is and obviously

376
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:31,890
will you support any customers of ours

377
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:33,269
with the software at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

378
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">to also include our customer</font>

379
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:37,500
requirements so if all our customers

380
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:40,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay everything you do from now on you</font>

381
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,340
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push high trust a software</font>

382
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,559
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not going to like</font>

383
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,000
well I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we're going to be a</font>

384
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">hydro certified as a software</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> company</font>

385
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,590
but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to push that</font>

386
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:50,850
down the line as we said earlier and

387
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:53,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're not usually the first thing we</font>

388
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:56,668
ask is so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have software that</font>

389
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:58,799
already met our requirements are you

390
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:01,230
just going out there because my friend

391
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,809
told me I should use this so we can work

392
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,340
on the same project later or do we

393
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:06,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">already have a tool in place that does</font>

394
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,970
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need except for that one</font>

395
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,470
functionality way now the toolbar is

396
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:14,309
purple and you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it to look</font>

397
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:15,690
different so we asked people that and

398
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:17,010
then if they're like well we have

399
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">something similar than we need them to</font>

400
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,940
state a business case then we start

401
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,460
including their manager and their VPS

402
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,809
and as soon as you really as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

403
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,830
start including people's<font color="#E5E5E5"> higher-ups</font>

404
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:27,750
they're like oh we don't really need

405
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:31,490
this software anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more we'll just</font>

406
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,490
you know we'll do what you have this

407
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:45,210
yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this process here and then</font>

408
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:48,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll I think we'll get to on another</font>

409
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:51,059
screen this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a security</font>

410
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:54,720
function it's like you're integrating a

411
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:57,269
lot of pieces altogether as a securement

412
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,120
like beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we start with the</font>

413
00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:01,919
money as we end<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the money is but</font>

414
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,939
then you got privacy in law<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this this</font>

415
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> legal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is information security</font>

416
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:13,070
it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different roles</font>

417
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,070
involved in this evaluation

418
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:21,310
all I follow to make security<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

419
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:25,330
under BTW what they call business

420
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:27,600
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> IT a min real well so we all</font>

421
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:33,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there but the roller I key is</font>

422
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:35,110
working on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> then our biggest task was</font>

423
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:38,470
just including all the other departments

424
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:41,649
so financial legal procurement acting

425
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:44,620
contracting so financial is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 financial</font>

426
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,820
is the key player and everything as<font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font>

427
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,379

00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:58,290
three key questions that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask so this</font>

573
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:01,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">is what we initiate with with the</font>

574
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:03,360
vendors well in our PP so so the vendors

575
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:06,510
office by require physical access to the

576
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:09,709
facility does vendor software supplier

577
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:13,980
require network access and will this

578
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:17,100
store access review all our stuff all

579
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:19,140
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data so if you answer yes to the</font>

580
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:22,110
first question note see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other ones</font>

581
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,730
will give you a badge but that's only

582
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,889
like you're doing maintenance in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

583
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:30,369
building

584
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:33,039
yeah still comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> with agreed then or we</font>

585
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:36,519
used to have a quiz but they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

586
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:39,999
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore so now it's just agreement</font>

587
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:44,859
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they read and sign it's</font>

588
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:48,279
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Indiana said so we start all</font>

589
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:49,779
our securities with the software intake

590
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,879
and then we have another<font color="#E5E5E5"> intake form and</font>

591
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:55,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we move on to these three questions</font>

592
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:58,238
so based on how these get answered and

593
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:00,460
what type of data they're looking at we

594
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:02,889
give them a pre ranking so the types of

595
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,629
data classifications that we look at our

596
00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:07,570
public restricted confidential and

597
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:09,879
internal data classifications yes so the

598
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:13,119
dead classifications is along the line

599
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:17,349
of the shredded understand what is what

600
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:21,549
like I think it's better to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

601
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:24,009
the data descriptions because everybody

602
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:27,908
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own interpretations of what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PH</font>

603
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:30,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">is or p is you know google has is</font>

604
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:32,669
interpretation and the lesser dictionary

605
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:35,830
has its interpretation at our company

606
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:38,169
member data is considered<font color="#E5E5E5"> pH I so</font>

607
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:43,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything that our customer provides you</font>

608
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:45,489
you know is considered thi and we do

609
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:48,519
that just to protect it at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> highest</font>

610
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:51,789
degree and ensure we're doing our due

611
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:54,340
diligence but these data classifications

612
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:55,899
for us and security professionals if we

613
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,789
have data descriptions that we can see

614
00:31:55,899 --> 00:32:00,849
if it's public is just something that

615
00:31:57,789 --> 00:32:05,080
you know if it's lost its lost there's

616
00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:07,779
no harm in that restricted is usually

617
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:10,809
dealing with the customer data or like

618
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:15,539
your employees like personal information

619
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:19,239

<font color="#CCCCCC">Healthways from from one level to</font>

626
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:38,140
another level that type of information

00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:40,810
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want your competitors to know</font>

628
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:45,760
about and then internal this is the

00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:50,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">stool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information that is like useful to</font>

you procedures processes that you have

631
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:58,180
in place and just internal data like

632
00:32:54,730 --> 00:33:00,280
about the company about a bit about this

633
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:02,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">disease lifetime so these are these are</font>

634
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,340
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we use their like kind</font>

635
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:11,080
of understand how we're going to

636
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:13,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">evaluate example yes so those key</font>

637
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,639
questions they start<font color="#E5E5E5"> off with internal</font>

638
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,560
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoever wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the software or</font>

639
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,200
supplier those three key questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

640
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:23,320
questions start off with in and then

641
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:25,180
this data classification is like this is

642
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:28,270
how data is classified in our

643
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:30,640
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is how we have to</font>

644
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:32,770
evaluate like what type of data is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

645
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,540
to be a part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that engagement so</font>

646
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:36,100
there's an internal questionnaire to

647
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,139
tackling and it's providing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

648
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">information and sometimes you can ask</font>

649
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:42,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">them to say hey is it this that or the</font>

650
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:44,490
other but that's dangerous because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

651
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:48,010
don't know so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> she stacks four</font>

652
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:50,050
elements<font color="#CCCCCC"> but give me examples of what</font>

653
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:52,990
type of data you're going to be dealing

654
00:33:50,050 --> 00:34:03,030
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'll make the call to classify</font>

655
00:33:52,990 --> 00:34:05,980
it in the profile do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide this</font>

656
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:27,610
what will work<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a request for</font>

657
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:29,350
proposal yeah you're talking OS which is

658
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:31,240
it yeah the security required with

659
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:33,909
documented that that would be like

660
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:38,189
spelled out like how we refer to

661
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:38,190
whatever exchange of adversity

662
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:49,190
if not we first went there is no matter

663
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:55,309
what if you in their vice president

664
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:59,839
people call this force<font color="#E5E5E5"> among us about 10</font>

665
00:34:55,309 --> 00:35:01,849
here's a time that my neighbors you know

666
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,589
I make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they understand that I don't</font>

667
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:05,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">think they're done I feel too glad you</font>

671
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,109
modifying out individuals who want to

672
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:24,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">take that this point as a divided into</font>

673
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:26,509
two categories important and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

675
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:30,289
gonna worry about selling information

676
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:33,828
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> me Annette and then it does that</font>

677
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:36,670
is just that intercept a vulnerability

678
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:39,079
assessment and testers I mean get rusev

679
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:45,799
dependent on staff is will allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

680
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:48,799
people in here so it's important to

681
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:50,900
classify that data add important because

682
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:53,809
if you don't understand why they don't

683

you this is restricted data and this is

694
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:34,060
why it's restricted data they suffer the

695

data elements that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you gave me and in</font>

the third<font color="#E5E5E5"> party now we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it ourselves</font>

700
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:47,830
as well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we still have to let them</font>

701
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:50,170
know this is a process this is why<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

702
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:52,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening and it will it has strike up</font>

703
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:53,680
conversations because there's some

704
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,990
people out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there that are not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">islands like whoa welcome to health</font>

709
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:10,000
place its pH I because everything that's

710
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:11,618
cuz we're related yeah that is important

711
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,400
to have those conversations<font color="#E5E5E5"> such as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

712
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:18,250
off on the same page and hopefully never

713
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,020
have a violation yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost we do</font>

714
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:22,510
that internal questionnaire with just a

715
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:24,070
business owners and answer our questions

716
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:30,400
and figure out what the classification

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,790
do pre rankings and post ranking so

719
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:36,040
we'll give it a pre loyal pre medium

720
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:38,859
pretty high pretty critical so free lil

721

726
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,140
depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ranking depends on what</font>

727
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:58,299
type of secondary questionnaire we're

728
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,009
going to send to the vendor so first we

729
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,450
deal with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> business owners figure out</font>

730
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:04,210
what they know about this Avenger how

731
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:05,589
they plan on using them then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find a</font>

732
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:08,020
point of contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the vendor and we</font>

733
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,580
start reaching out to the vendor so we

734
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,230
have a two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> questionnaire so</font>

735
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:14,410
you have one for low and medium it's

736
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:17,170
about 30 questions and also ask for

737
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:18,910
evidence for something<font color="#E5E5E5"> samana high in</font>

738
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,940
critical we bump that up to about 70

739
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:25,180
questions

740
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:27,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> masony are familiar with a cig</font>

745
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:49,450
my opinion it is definitely useful and

746
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:52,880
it is definitely something that you know

747

915
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:16,380
posture that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had and then use a</font>

916
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:20,730
third party to do an independent<font color="#CCCCCC"> review</font>

917
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:22,020
and validate what you say so after all

918
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:23,760
these security assessments after our

919
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:25,320
third party goes in after we have

920
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,460
follow-up conference call so you answer

921
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,560
a couple questions that we're not happy

922
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:31,020
with we jump on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a call with the ask for</font>

923
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,880
clarity if we're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> not happy we'll</font>

924
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,900
ask you to bring in an architect or

925
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,880
something to explain a little more

926
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,110
detail and after that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still not</font>

927
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,700
happy then we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a business</font>

928
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:40,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">owner sign off on the risk</font>

929
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,810
ethics of the risks and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you you'll</font>

930
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,970
find that your company will<font color="#CCCCCC"> engage with</font>

931
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:47,240
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who have no security program they</font>

932
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:50,910
didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any no privacy officer and</font>

933
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:54,270
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even have like a password on</font>

934
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:56,490
their computer it's like and it's like

935
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:59,940
they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with them and</font>

936
00:47:56,490 --> 00:48:03,270
it's like we can't we can say we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

937
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:06,210
recommend because of this risk but what

938
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:07,950
we found around that is like if we're

939
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:10,140
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to engage them on pawn shop so</font>

940
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:12,810
we're going to gauge the running while

941
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:14,520
type people with a hair on fire they're

942
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:16,440
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through our training they're</font>

943
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:19,680
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use our equipment like someone</font>

944
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:22,920
was speaking of earlier and they're

945
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:25,230
going to be our contract it higher and

946
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,490
we're going to monitor them just as hard

947
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:31,579
as we would monitor the person that's

948
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:34,589
asking for it yes we bring them into our

949
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:35,970
processes we bring the visit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> most of</font>

950
00:48:34,589 --> 00:48:40,440
those people and most of those places

951
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:45,140
are so happy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> forego a long security</font>

952
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:49,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">document and join the team basically</font>

958
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:41,310
will be your name but another thing I've

959
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:46,730
learned is like people aren't as

960
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:49,170
malicious as it seems it<font color="#CCCCCC"> did just</font>

961
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:53,970
ignorant like they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know any better</font>

962
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:57,540
and if you have like<font color="#E5E5E5"> information to give</font>

963
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:59,790
them about that it's money talks like if

964
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:03,690
you say hey we could go out a bit of

965
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:06,500
this week we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could be in breach of</font>

966
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:10,589
contract that kind of stuff is

967
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:14,070
translates better than saying oh no this

968
00:50:10,589 --> 00:50:17,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">is you know not some technical talk</font>

969
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:20,040
jargon<font color="#CCCCCC"> all over my belt off sick look if</font>

970
00:50:17,369 --> 00:50:22,079
we do this we're in jeopardy is this

971
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:28,130
that any other you make them aware of it

972
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:28,130
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometime grudgingly go along with it</font>

973
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,930
and then you just a rich ranking so

974
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:36,720
after our valuation third-party phone

975
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:39,450
calls back and forth well we've got a

976
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,399
MTN minimal to no risk so that's you

977

1040
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:21,690
who still has access to the accounts but

everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing in-house is</font>

1042
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:25,980
working but I have vendors that still

1043
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:27,720
have access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my account and they don't</font>

sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are companies in reserve so</font>

1046
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:38,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a vendor and on the</font>

1047
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,480
questionnaire like the one of our

1048
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,920
question assets actually have some

1049
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,680
vendors that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to perform task</font>

1050
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,820
for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well so as soon as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we find</font>

1051
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">that out we actually begin the whole</font>

1052
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:48,780
process with them as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we won't</font>

1053
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:50,490
complete the process was the main vendor

1054
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:53,430
until all is sub members have completed

1055
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:54,779
it so that's our same process we need

1056
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:58,410
training validation you get in the same

1057
00:53:54,780 --> 00:54:01,050
questionnaire so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it can it slow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

1058
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:02,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process but like we said we should</font>

1059
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:05,280
get once you get financial on board

1060
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:08,010
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay with slowing it down it's</font>

1061
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:15,599
rather we wait now and pay exponentially

1062
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:19,770
more later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what's up when he doesn't</font>

1063
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:24,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">be done at karmaloop contract this comes</font>

1064
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:27,720
up that you see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cindy</font>

1066
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:31,348
yeah that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we try to do with our</font>

1067
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:35,279
financial once they get it they kick us

1068
00:54:31,349 --> 00:54:36,750
off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we send out our requirements and</font>

1069
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:46,369
our question is as they're working on

1070
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:49,440
everything else as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> record-keeping</font>

1071
00:54:46,369 --> 00:54:51,990
you do all this work what are you

1072
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:54,510
storing it this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just everyone just</font>

1073
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:56,098
has a filing cabinet so centralized

1074
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:59,160
storage location so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we started using</font>

1075
00:54:56,099 --> 00:55:02,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">sharepoint a couple other tools to just</font>

1076
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:05,250
keep everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> in track also we have a</font>

1077
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">shared email inbox so Willie myself or</font>

1078
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:09,960
anybody else<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's helping us perform</font>

1079
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:12,119
these will send up from one email mr.

1080
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,040
vendor response we all know we got it

1081
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:15,270
and we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just let each other know hey I</font>

1082
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,430
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this one up I'll look at</font>

1083
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:20,099
the questionnaire first once i'm done

1084
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:21,839
i'll post it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the SharePoint site let</font>

1085
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:23,970
you guys go<font color="#E5E5E5"> review without you know what</font>

1086
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:26,250
I thought so it goes through at least

1087
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:27,810
two or three of us internally then if

1088
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:29,580
we're still compete if we still have

1089
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:31,200
questions will engage quarrel as well

1090
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:34,348
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll review the entire question</font>

1091
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,700
again and then we'll come together like

1092
00:55:34,349 --> 00:55:37,530
ok these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues that we have</font>

1093
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the questionnaire what were you</font>

1094
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:41,700
guys able to find what's there

1095
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:44,470
search based on that will engaging

1096
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:47,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">vendor get them on a call start an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email</font>

1097
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:49,689
chain so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the all the data</font>

1098
00:55:47,560 --> 00:56:13,390
ahead of us and are able to just<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

1099
00:55:49,690 --> 00:56:18,220
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other yes so we we from our</font>

1100
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:19,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">stage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we that we delve into what existed</font>

1101
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:24,149
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools that they were already</font>

1102
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:27,549
already were leveraging to handle a

1103
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:29,590
vendor payment and the vendor process<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1104
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:32,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">it accounts payable all that felix sells</font>

1105
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:36,540
forceful so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> tweak</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> salesforce to</font>

1106
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:40,570
basically just have a intake process for

1107
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:42,759
security and that intake process would

1108
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:46,150
deliver a notification out to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1109
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:50,020
various different departments we have of

1110
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:52,000
the GRC tools for us and specific there

1111
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:55,270
in the GRC tool that we want it but they

1112
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,360
would send a VA agreement so we resort

1113
00:56:55,270 --> 00:57:00,490
back to just we go wherever finance is

1114
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:02,620
whatever systems that they're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1115
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:04,810
can use our<font color="#E5E5E5"> sharepoint we use it for</font>

1116
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:06,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">other type of intake things but because</font>

1117
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:08,620
they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and they already have</font>

1118
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:12,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">access to that we wanted to plug into</font>

1119
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:14,589
today resistant so why audit purposes

1120
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:16,240
and organization everything is essential

1121
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:18,340
application we can all go in and play

1122
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:22,890
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add your name at the end of</font>

00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:25,180
it or turn on comments speaking of

1124
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:28,150
audits so we'll do internal external

1125
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:29,680
audit with our vendors for the pinning

1126

all under final<font color="#CCCCCC"> rich</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ranking you have</font>

1128
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:37,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">know at least an annual review every two</font>

1130
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:42,940
risk we started the audit process this

1131
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:45,310
past year we're going every month i will

intake process with the business owner

1135
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:53,230
depending on how they then answer those

1136
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:56,290
questions we can figure out if

1137
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:58,000
aluminum to risk or someone might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

left some information out for there was

00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,590
some sort of change in what they're

going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we have to start</font>

questionnaires people try<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways the real</font>

1142
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:09,730
process and sometimes people will

1143
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,130
unintentionally do it in sometimes they

1144
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:13,540
will intentionally I say hey if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

1145
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:18,580
say no<font color="#CCCCCC"> none of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've never had to</font>

1146
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:21,700
see where his face and so that's what

1147
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:23,770
the auditors floor and for agreeing like

1148
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:25,660
one more slide like annual evidence

1149
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:26,830
gathering so if you say hey next<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1150
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:28,540
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a sock to report ready for</font>

1151
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:30,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">you forgets what make sure we're going</font>

1152
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:32,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ask for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that sought to report want to</font>

1153
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:34,480
keep asking about until we get a copy so

1154
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:36,640
any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of evidence whether we get this</font>

1155
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:39,220
year we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to require of you as</font>

1156
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:41,500
soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you update it again the</font>

1157
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:44,259
mitigation follow through so like I said

1158
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:46,900
will once we engage vendors and we

1159
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:49,780
figure out ways to improve their

1160
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:51,280
security posture will discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them</font>

1161
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:53,560
hey here's the timeline this is what you

1162
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,150
can do to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know you want</font>

1163
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:56,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">continue the relationship with us and</font>

1164
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:59,619
you want to improve your<font color="#CCCCCC"> posture to make</font>

1165
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:01,660
us safer in yourself reviews we start

1166
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:03,220
the process all over again as soon as

1167
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:05,200
they're the<font color="#CCCCCC"> changing scope so like you</font>

1168
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:06,730
were saying maybe we just want my

1169
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rockies issue well next year under</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buy</font>

1170
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">something else the whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> starts</font>

1171
00:59:08,859 --> 00:59:16,330
again and inactive like we said if our

1172
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:18,100
business relationship ends there's a

1173
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:19,690
whole nother set of questionnaire that

1174
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:21,069
could send<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what have you done with</font>

1175
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:23,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">our data are you following what we</font>

1176
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:26,670
signed our contract how can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ensure</font>

1177
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:30,279
to us but you did follow this process

1178
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:32,020
some quick tips always look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for ways</font>

1179
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:34,000
automate automate automate automate when

1180
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:35,800
you can well there's two people and

1181
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,770
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> four thousand vendors automation</font>

1182
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:40,060
is your best<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends try repeatable</font>

1183
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:42,220
processes so we've learned these

1184
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:46,299
question is work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us we adapt them as</font>

1185
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:47,830
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go keep going simplify degrading if</font>

1186
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:49,000
they meet the requirement yes or no if

1187
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:50,920
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> close they still need it</font>

1188
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,869
ninety-five percent depending on the

1189
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:56,380
risk they meet it you don't want to

1190
00:59:52,869 --> 01:00:00,880
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking questions A through Z for</font>

1191
00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:02,530
one small thing we use electronic at the

1192
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,840
station form so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> email them and</font>

1193
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:06,140
there's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> a copy we save it to the</font>

1194
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,839
SharePoint side it's

1195
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:10,879
so I is much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as possible identify all</font>

1196
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:14,000
players like we said finance procurement

1197
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:16,250
legal anyone we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> involved to help</font>

1198
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,470
us in our process the tunnel everyone in

1199
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:20,869
where we'll be best friends with them as

1200
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:23,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">long as possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> integrate into existing</font>

1201
01:00:20,869 --> 01:00:24,670
processes like we said we'd share point

1202
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:26,750
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> finances your share price</font>

1203
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:28,460
whatever everyone else is<font color="#CCCCCC"> using we're</font>

1204

1205
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:32,480
