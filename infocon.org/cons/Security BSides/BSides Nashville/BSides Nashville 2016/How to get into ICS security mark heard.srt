1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,269
coded gap right after the excellent
lines and if you had seconds I know that

2
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:13,799
you're going to struggle and fight off
at now but I mean your camp you know so

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,500
far doze off someone just call my name
is Mark Hurd I work in the ICS security

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,720
group consulting group in Mandya I have
a hearing the final furlong misspent

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,990
youth is controlled chemical sector and
I can think safely categorize myself at

6
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,030
the recovering in user but I've been in
an insecurity while i wanna talk to you

7
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,260
a little bit this afternoon or this year
is this afternoon now about getting into

8
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,890
industrial control system security
there's this quarter and just appreciate

9
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,700
those of you that moved out front
there's still lots of seats and all the

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,430
gravity turned up pretty high back there
but he struggled through that you can

11
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,489
get a little bit of audience
participation we're gonna get you in and

12
00:00:54,489 --> 00:01:00,050
in a moment and that made it may be
important to me but I think think they

13
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,158
have size of you haven't already
realized that I T you know information

14
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,920
technology and operational technology
there's a lot of overlap but they're not

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,140
exactly the same thing and when you if
you're involved here work for a company

16
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,560
and you're you're interested in dinner
enterprise wide security is going to

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,049
include the operational technology plan
for stuff but it isn't necessarily going

18
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,310
to be all the same issues in one run at
the same pace as I take their not

19
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,450
equivalent or ignore they said equal
substitute for each other by the way is

20
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,079
understanding yes widespread these
presentations are gonna be hosted by

21
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,770
IronKey sometimes real sometime real
soon now as far as getting copies like

22
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,149
I'm not sure what that could have been a
way to reach out to me and I cannot

23
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,000
provide you some more detail with just
gonna have some links and such as that

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,079
might be useful to you know the mania
posted their information and where is

25
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,389
the brain hurt in this session is it
gonna be as high as it was in theirs but

26
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,540
getting access to the slide to
understand it's been interesting and

27
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:59,350
useful to you this is a link to a little
video drop will put together that's a

28
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,829
retro encapsulate or that this film with
more another jargon to fill several

29
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:06,330
things go karts and it's kind of
entertaining to watch

30
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,240
about a two-minute videos to really too
big to invade into play here but wanted

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,040
to point of view that process I i dont
have don't have an embedded

32
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,090
we made double back on the company and
played it and depending on how boring

33
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,550
this decision gets it

34
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,800
not seen it in again it's a whole lot of
a whole other jargon disguise with some

35
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,780
fan waving and faith in a sales pitch so
this audience participation part of what

36
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:41,770
what are you doing here what would you
like to get from this session in here

37
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,600
from school that's I was hoping I was
going to ask you to present but you know

38
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,079
it's not a subpoena so school that's
fantastic I was hoping to get folks that

39
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,350
were interested in learning about this
who were actual students not your

40
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,120
students have any other way to get me
any other criteria something that you

41
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,390
don't want to leave here without me
saying something about ICS what is ICS

42
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:24,329
will we will talk about that I see the
need to have every conversation like

43
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:24,780
this

44
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:31,239
open anything else this occurs as you go
along this let's talk about that first

45
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,400
of all I'm talking about ICS a kind of a
broad term and yeah I could wax wax on

46
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,600
for a while and it's a few were from
government a few years ago the last

47
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:46,150
decade you would call this kata kata
different people call it different

48
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,190
things I was going to national problems
and getting some control system security

49
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,890
off the ground is it when you started
trying to put together a discussion

50
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,950
around security best practices are
standards the guys that were in had

51
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,850
already used for treating the PLC
documents and they weren't reading the

52
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:05,290
DTCs documents and the people at DCS is
what reading the SCADA documents and all

53
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,840
he's a really the same thing I mean
industrial control systems is kind of

54
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,150
the catch phrase that

55
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,420
it's kind of been embraced by the six
hundred-pound gorilla which is part of

56
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,880
Homeland Security and it created a group
in the late 2000 called the ICS JWG

57
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,580
terrible Akron man stands for industrial
control systems Joint Working Group is a

58
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,930
place to kind of get all of these
disparities groups in silos and

59
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,970
verticals talking and sharing together
and this this phrase is kind of a kind

60
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,430
of talk right kind of kind of stuff it
in Corinna compass what you might call

61
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:42,949
SCADA PLC systems in my covers building
automation systems covers manufacturing

62
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:47,479
control systems are many industrial
automation and control systems always

63
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:53,370
raises basically Ric guess but that
helped a lot more acronyms here and I'll

64
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,180
try to be careful about that because it
is a huge amount a prism acronym

65
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,039
poisoning in his field you look at the
Strand there's kind of a kind of a

66
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:07,229
hockey stick type of effect here you
notice in their early safe before 2 2010

67
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:12,039
you know kind of relatively flat 10
since 2010 there's a lot of activity why

68
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:21,320
magic word here ok can have it can have
an ICS security talk about saying at

69
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,400
least wants right said if we had a
headache is this drinking game this week

70
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:35,719
it started so what it showed up on the
radar I mean is actual it was on on a

71
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,940
proof of concept I mean it was not
beyond concept of an actual successfully

72
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,810
exploit against the targeted at
industrial control system which got a

73
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,760
lot of the security researchers since
I'm using that term and brought it for

74
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:54,210
that tax and so what used to become a
side conversations security conferences

75
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,669
or maybe even something that was at the
end of a dead-end whole way suddenly got

76
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:01,599
moved up and got to be key knows so you
get a lot more security researchers

77
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:05,460
interested in that security researcher
start looking at things they find stuff

78
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,500
so you see these these bars here things
that are actually discovered

79
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,930
vulnerabilities discovered some
published Mobility's they're actually

80
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,280
exploits the other

81
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,150
reddish color there depending on the
degree of color blindness in India

82
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,250
actual in the Green Party actual mail
the stuff that becomes targeted at

83
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,430
industrial control systems are released
where malware is put together as part of

84
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,580
an industrial control systems attack so
we can have a lost decade of not a whole

85
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,539
lot of progress of attention being put
on it and suddenly now this event occurs

86
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:39,120
ducks and a lot of gas being thrown in
this process now this is this is the

87
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,300
really framing the problem I'm here to
try to do try to address is it think

88
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,470
about the overlap in these two diagrams
ok the industrial control system humans

89
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,450
there are many people that are involved
with the care and feeding and design

90
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:57,469
implementation and so on and so forth
modification creating industrial control

91
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,840
systems engineers technicians operators
lots of people in in many companies all

92
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,489
over the world they're involved in and
industrial control systems the number of

93
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,460
security humans and this is again based
on to cover inside scientific study but

94
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,940
just looking at security related
listings and 2015 people that say that

95
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,380
they are involved in security
professionals on LinkedIn is about

96
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:26,860
$189,000 we got millions with $189,000
overlap a tiny little overlap that

97
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,880
basically points saying that there is
about a thousand people that have been

98
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:38,500
identified as industrial control systems
security professionals that now we hear

99
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,860
from the troubles so the point being is
that the question is is this point five

100
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:49,880
percent really adequate to protect
critical infrastructure really and so

101
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,550
that's that's the need to even even to
consider topic like this said I'd like

102
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,610
to try to recruit you'd like to try to
take your interest you're brought

103
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,530
interest AP news can find out what the
acronym to take the start with this

104
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,349
broad interest and get you more
interested in following up with the next

105
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:11,410
steps in getting into industrial control
so let's consider the first side out of

106
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,380
curiosity how many people would describe
yourselves and your current position is

107
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,150
being involved with the plant for
manufacturing operations the operational

108
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,989
technology side too

109
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:27,560
not meeting ok well if you asked our the
safety radically that you were though

110
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,800
and we'll walk you through what I think
will be useful information on how to get

111
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,980
started down the path of bringing some
bringing more games and industrial

112
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,960
control systems maybe you know somebody
may be back when you were who works with

113
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,870
these folks who acts as a consultant or
design a greater or even even from the

114
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:50,120
vendor side or you know just got out
your brother your neighbor works inside

115
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,750
this and you would like to go back and
see them with some of this information

116
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,350
to gauge their interest and help them
get along or you know someone at this

117
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,440
this this material also be useful to you

118
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:06,200
operational technology is not the same
as industrial technology because it's

119
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,680
it's it's a matter of priority of the
same technologies are deployed their

120
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,530
Windows and Linux PCs that are connected
to systems of systems that do things to

121
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:20,000
that manufacturer protector are run
interlocks they establish some kind of

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,780
automation functionality and if you're
if you're already on the ok side already

123
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,750
familiar with that process he already
got they've got that in the bank you

124
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,770
already know about the safety safety
culture inside your company company you

125
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,160
know the plant process works were used
to using things like pro programmable

126
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,020
logic controllers or remote terminal
units here already used to those and how

127
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,270
they are architected together and maybe
have some kind of exposure some of the

128
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:48,470
protocols such as you may even be more
familiar with things like yourself for

129
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,070
the energy industry or seafood for the
chemical sector that our security

130
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,370
standards that are used by those
industries to help them improve their

131
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,070
surprise their process control security
posture you've already got that kind of

132
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,160
stuff going for you even if you aren't
currently involved but now only now see

133
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,270
opportunity for you to start winning
some more about security and revenue

134
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,360
earnings starting out specifically doing
everything about process control

135
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,070
security there's some general security
stuff to help you kind of think like a

136
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,930
bad guy get past that will live in about
you want to do that question as far as

137
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,229
saying that safety you know you go
through you and your inside your plant

138
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:27,460
culture was safety it you you spend a
lot of time in design and review saying

139
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,600
what what what could go wrong

140
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,889
what if I got the raw material here this
pie plea for this bus to do this part

141
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:36,230
overheated you consider what might go
wrong

142
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,579
well from the security point of view
it's really the same event that we're

143
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:43,709
talking about but I'm thinking about
somebody making it go wrong and using

144
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,930
electronic means to be able to do so
it's really a huge amount of overlap you

145
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,939
already got the right sensibilities
working in operations you just not just

146
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,779
need to start thinking about you get in
touch with a dinner vandal and thinking

147
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,329
about how you can leverage that
information to call some harm and you do

148
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:04,069
that by basically trying to learn to go
in interface learn and talk to the folks

149
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:09,719
that already know what you doin it is
Jason Scott if you see a lot of my

150
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,339
thunder earlier today we talked about
building these relationships and

151
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,880
relationships are key you gotta find the
people who know what it is that you want

152
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,860
and develop relationships develop open
up a channel of communication so that

153
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,949
you can have an information exchange
between can be mutually beneficial when

154
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:31,959
things you need to do is go to security
like this one where the subject matters

155
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:35,439
can be talked to you can also get
there's lots of lots and lots of

156
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:39,389
material that's available online there's
a particular security training which you

157
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:43,920
can go to folks like sounds and red
tiger in SCADA hacker and course I see a

158
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,639
search your tax dollars at work as the
prices prices nice it's free but you do

159
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:55,019
have to go to Idaho Falls to take a
little traveling traveling can be

160
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:00,329
involved but surely really terrific
training there's also some releases the

161
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:08,349
samurai STFU it is a particular Linux
distro this designed like backtrack with

162
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,670
most of the commonly used tools that
could be used to break into hardware and

163
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:15,300
software at the control system level as
well as some of the best tools that

164
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,859
would be taken from Micah backtrack CD
as well as some other things that were

165
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,329
developed by the folks at a utility put
together this particular distribution is

166
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:25,620
like a security testing

167
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,089
function utility I think it's something
but the acronym stands for

168
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:33,260
there are some other things in the
showdown Ohio website you can you can

169
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,880
basically go to learn more about what
some of the issues are but their

170
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,230
operational technologies but the
company's work for the you already

171
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,880
employ security experts the guys that
are already have passes like years ago

172
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,410
the same workplace that you do and go to
the same meetings and town halls of such

173
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:55,339
a to do that are inside your company
that are already security experts so

174
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:57,730
make friends with some find out who they
are

175
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,300
find out he's a networking security
folks are and learn what it is some of

176
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,359
what they do about configurator
configuring switches and firewalls learn

177
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,830
about how security architecture worked
within your company by talking to the

178
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,980
people that are just like you and your
company and just trying to do a good job

179
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,820
to look out for greater president
interest of course this may just may

180
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,730
require developing some new skills and
tastes like you are already are already

181
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,240
interested in caffeine may have to
develop an interesting and other things

182
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,610
that you can do is create and ICS lab
and a lot of times you know the court in

183
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,260
here illustrates you know you can do
anything you want something you don't

184
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:41,000
have to his song birds but probably
inside your company you've got enough

185
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,930
spare parts laying around for your
distro control systems that you can

186
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,729
configure most of a layup with just a
spare parts that you got the wrong

187
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:52,150
around in boxes and yeah you got it he
is someone who needs a spark there gonna

188
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,500
come they're going to take power supply
overlap but in the meantime you can use

189
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,339
it as a party lol just using a few of
these spare parts that you've got and

190
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,529
being created and then you might have to
go to your lender or broker them to

191
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:08,250
donate my license or somethin somethin
and sign out sign an agreement that said

192
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,150
you won't use production but you just
use it inside of a lab environment but

193
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,199
with a little bit of creativity you can
set up your own on-site

194
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:23,590
many companies do this and I can't
recommend it because it gives you a

195
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,940
place to begin learning about how your
system behaves under high traffic

196
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:33,700
situations what happens when you pass
what happens when you you get some kind

197
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,840
of program that you want to introduce
and soak up a lot of CPU how did the

198
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,890
operator consoles gonna hate you find
out kind of a benign environment

199
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:46,870
production to twenty things with ICS
inside of your plant manufacturing areas

200
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,390
live productions can I mean they they
will run with malware songs are

201
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,490
continuing to make make class one
product and I don't want to take the

202
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,980
interruption even to take them out of
the system if they're making production

203
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,310
products are critical portion of
production availability that system into

204
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,930
having a lot more impact to them than
the other security and that's something

205
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,550
that you have to have to take special
care when you're learning about

206
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:16,349
securities never never work on live live
equipment without permission and s

207
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,480
general general good security practice
you know as a security professional you

208
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,760
never never work on somebody else
somebody else's system without explicit

209
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,920
permission that's just the thing being
upfront professional and ethical now you

210
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,839
know that hired you to Pinterest it they
want they want you to break into it

211
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,170
that's different that's different you
know you negotiated their you doing it

212
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:39,310
with their permission but don't use
don't use anything that you learn as a

213
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,770
security professional against

214
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:45,810
gets a system that you have explicit
permission to do that just a general

215
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,530
rule so Stuxnet happened

216
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:53,470
ok that's it I'm not going to talk I'm
not going to talk in detail about sex

217
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:58,390
but you'd have to have a cold water to
throw but there's it was an amazing how

218
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:03,180
can it is a demonstration of what what
you could do with extreme amount of

219
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,250
inside knowledge at a very targeted
attack Stuxnet certainly demonstrated

220
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:12,140
straight so beyond the proof of concept
for your operation what you're stuck

221
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:17,950
think about it again this is like you
you put your head on a step back a

222
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:23,420
little bit said if somebody knew what I
knew about my process my process works

223
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,380
on my system is architected what could
they make it go wrong if somebody had my

224
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,850
prints they had my operational
procedures they had access to the

225
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,800
information that I got what did they
make so what what what would be the

226
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,290
consequences that you might think well
it's too complicated you know I got got

227
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,890
got some process engineering staff had
to design this and nobody understands

228
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:48,620
how it works except for the fact that
it's all mapped out and all his

229
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,030
knowledge about how the process works
got pumped into a configuration of

230
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:57,199
programming inside of the control system
it's always so someone had access and

231
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,110
stole the process files and had them
available to them available and time on

232
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,890
their hands what would they be able to
discover also see some of your testing

233
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,530
on a lab you might actually find and
discover vulnerabilities you can publish

234
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:14,260
and go to your vendor we had to get
remediated and get fame and glory might

235
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,680
be associated with publishing
vulnerability scratch your itch but the

236
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,870
idea is to hold the whole half a month
to really understand some to have that

237
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:25,780
the work you do have spent some time
maybe breaking and understand how to not

238
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:30,450
only take it take it apart and put it
back together and of course we like to

239
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,650
promote finding evil it each and every
opportunity we get the opportunity

240
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:40,370
there's this idea red team the attack
and blue team to defend learn what

241
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:45,610
language of these two environments are
and how they interact together there's

242
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:51,310
that sports all kind of knowledge in
books and that's exactly the scenario

243
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,970
that we're talking about here when they
may be frustrated that I can hear him

244
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,570
listen you tell me how to do this i'ma
take a read books but the fact of the

245
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,110
matter is that they had a lot of
knowledge in books and what you can

246
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,399
learn about Metasploit which can learn
about showdown we can learn about things

247
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,530
like a snore in such there's lots and
lots of stuff that's written about that

248
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,530
whether this publish digitally are
published in the school

249
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:17,649
dead tree versions finding and finally
locating some of these books in the

250
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:33,580
library and study is going to be time
I've heard of it turns out he's world

251
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:41,800
class and you can even convert another
benefit to go to conferences like this

252
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,419
you might actually meet some of the guys
that had input into books are actually

253
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,420
involvement published

254
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,330
DFI or this is something that's
relatively new to the process automation

255
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,960
and process control this digital
forensics and incident response its

256
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,600
well-developed inside the idea there's a
lot of cutting-edge development in some

257
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,610
pretty good discipline tool that have
been developed for it is still pretty

258
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:11,610
new for the ICSI just not what folks are
prepared to do that and you know how did

259
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,889
what happens when you discover that
someone has impacted someone has and

260
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,110
true you got an intrusion on a process
automation system testing present a new

261
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:24,409
new new budget challenges 22 how your
company's going to handle that that if

262
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,510
it really pays off to do your homework
and think about it before then is

263
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:31,920
opposed to finding out afterwards if
your company's relationship with law

264
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,660
enforcement the local on like FBI isn't
in pretty good shape if somebody from

265
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,080
China breaks into your process
automation system you'll have a lot of

266
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,629
scrambling to do as you build that
relationship up so that you can get you

267
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,140
guys can help each other

268
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:51,610
doing that before the incident occurs
this is he here words cannot describe

269
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:55,310
you know that find out what their
capabilities are find out how they can

270
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,450
help you what their expectations would
be for them to help you if they're

271
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,520
counting on you pull on the hard drive
and presenting them to them is forensic

272
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,720
evidence will then the first thing you
need to do shouldn't be format the hard

273
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,660
drive and restore backup because all the
forensic evidence disappear yessir

274
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:23,560
but that there are groups that you can
become involved with us well and we'll

275
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,460
talk about those who opposes the
majority of you probably indicate your

276
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,540
interest is in information technology or
computer science or something from the

277
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,550
from the I T side and you'd like to get
in go the other direction you'd like

278
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:42,770
this you'd like to get into your control
system security but aren't quite sure

279
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:47,889
where to get started here so maybe this
is a sweet spot go too well course

280
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,280
google is your friend but you have to
ask you have to be able to ask questions

281
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,230
to get the information you want you know
this all the information basically been

282
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,780
collected since mankind collecting
information is probably available from

283
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,960
google but the the the real payoff is
when you ask ask the right questions so

284
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,300
you look at look for things like about
the model specification Modbus is one of

285
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,649
these computer protocols that used in
industrial control systems that all

286
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,540
kinds of devices can talk to me that's
one of the kind of the Babylon Fisher

287
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,760
choppers got the ideas you know if you
can talk this one language that

288
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,430
everybody understands our basic I guess
Federation talk there's also the people

289
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:34,040
of the community's made all sorts of
things available resources like it if

290
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,870
you are familiar with Wireshark that's a
good tool to get familiar with and go

291
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,429
and look for some of the peak out some
of the network captures our online that

292
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:45,410
you can get to places like sands and yes
for in some of these other libraries

293
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:49,570
that you can download it and replace
those pcap story Wireshark and just see

294
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,149
what the conversations

295
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:57,710
mob bosses when those protocols Athena
capitulated inside of tcp/ip so it's a

296
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:02,560
tcp/ip packet discard all that stuff on
it but its core it's the same our best

297
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,030
bet that was developed a load of steel
is still largely in clear text and ended

298
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:15,430
exactly the same command format such as
the old 1208 built in 1888 words month 1

299
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,690
stop bit no parity that was the spectra
development

300
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,790
there's are scads and scads YouTube
videos and and and how to use it

301
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:31,879
been made available tapes are i guess i
recordings of presentations like this at

302
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,440
such as you could find that are
available on number different format

303
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:41,090
again going in and asking for a specific
control systems PLC how it's made is

304
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,889
coming they they not only talk about the
chemistry and manufacturing processes

305
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,520
and such but they're actually give you
pictures of some of the some of the

306
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,010
environments in which the hell things
are made so that you can actually learn

307
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:56,280
quite a bit again it's almost
accidentally getting getting educated by

308
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,460
watching videos you know that's kind of
almost futuristic concept but there's a

309
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,930
lot of get information that is freely
available to you if you're on the

310
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:09,270
naughty side you already know how it got
pretty good I T chops and then you may

311
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,470
actually have a network at home where
you can begin to add to that network by

312
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:18,980
making a little I T network you can get
some things like red and he knows a

313
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:27,270
little programmable widgets you can buy
from manufacturers are on TV you can

314
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:32,120
actually go to Ebay and find some appeal
seized and and human human machine

315
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,830
interfaces HMIS this particular case you
can find them occasionally by them

316
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:43,730
basically found by buying them from eBay
and even getting since new equipment has

317
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,950
been superseded or left over from a job

318
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,390
$700 a lot to spend but if you're
already for something that you want to

319
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:55,130
learn about its not me its listen you
pay for a proper security course in with

320
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,670
you you can download generally the CDs
and development tools and such from the

321
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,680
manufacturers and learn a lot from just
getting into these things in your

322
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:08,070
environment down in your basement where
you can begin to play with many of these

323
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:12,030
things they get a read on it comes con
o'grady to be loaded with it with an

324
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:16,300
immature personality and you can do some
surgeons get some things to do some

325
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,590
connection

326
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:22,310
look look get some research to a
specific research on things like open

327
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:26,060
DMP and Modbus be able to get the
personalities that you want to lower on

328
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,950
the device

329
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:31,000
and haven't talked about us pro protocol
and and respond to even very simple

330
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,060
command-line interfaces from a Windows
based laptop again there's a lot of

331
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,129
learning and I'm not going I can't screw
up completely here but it's a lot of

332
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:42,970
tools that are available that are a year
open source or even they might be

333
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:46,150
licensed but they'll run for 10 or 20
minutes at a time it would be suitable

334
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:54,280
for you to learn what the very basics
with ok so you know security learn about

335
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:01,710
you you so many courses are classes you
at the University maybe maybe gotten a

336
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:07,430
CCNA or some other certification from
the icy aside from the IIT side but you

337
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:11,960
you want to learn more about ICS so you
not really quite there yet you've

338
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,310
learned some of the landscape you learn
some of the terminology and I'm gonna

339
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:20,590
give you the the the secret to getting
in behind the closed doors to get the

340
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:30,090
information if you are running late for
donuts universal language of control

341
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:35,169
rooms everywhere and yes I i mean don't
don't underestimate the power of a

342
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:39,750
pastry and this is really I'm saying
this facetiously but really this is

343
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:46,730
about developing this relationship work
for a company in the IDE side and the

344
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:50,440
company's manufacturing something I
think the information you want is

345
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,330
already inside the fence take your
company already employs process control

346
00:25:55,330 --> 00:26:00,300
system experts you just need to find
them and apply them for information now

347
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,840
you can't just drop in and shadow them
to develop a relationship you gotta show

348
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,780
that you're genuinely interested in what
it is that you're doing and learning and

349
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,340
even offered to tell them to share what
you know about your environment with

350
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:17,230
them particularly here in networker are
the networking of the personality that

351
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:21,080
actually interfaces with the process
control systems you got a real strong

352
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,030
basis for you to begin a conversation
and develop a relationship I'm not going

353
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:29,700
take credit that they don't think even
jason is well I've been hearing people

354
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,390
talking like James arlen been talking
about this for years that you find

355
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,840
somebody who knows what you want you
plotting with Pete so often you're done

356
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,590
until they tell them they tell you what
you wanna know if they don't know

357
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,980
they'll probably be very quick to tell
you and give you a pointer to the God

358
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,289
does so maybe you're starting with me
what you think is the lead operator

359
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:52,450
control room but he's not the state will
quickly point she'll tell you what he

360
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:56,539
knows I think especially in exchange for
some pastries but he'll have pointed to

361
00:26:56,539 --> 00:27:00,740
the guy that you need to talk to your
state to really start getting the

362
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:06,669
information systems architectures were
simple simple words toward what the you

363
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:13,779
know why can't you run a beyond a plz
plz why can't you why can't you don't

364
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:17,470
think patches every Tuesday when
Microsoft patches you begin to find that

365
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:21,539
information from the people that are
actually from there within closer to the

366
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:29,149
environment again there's no hiding
information and books and so mangled

367
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:32,789
beyond the may be online or maybe a
linear a couple of linear feet of them

368
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:35,960
in a bookshelf in the state and the
office that the information that you

369
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,960
want about how the system is architected
how it works

370
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,779
generally contained inside a man spend
some time with us as well again this is

371
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:50,210
this is this your your interest in this
is genuine and I think they the guys in

372
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:55,019
the control room can sniff out the face
you know if you just you just killing

373
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:58,860
time you lookin for somethin bullet put
on your accomplishments for the year to

374
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,279
fill out your resume the tech that ok
their sincerity texted her BS detector

375
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:10,260
pretty good because I traffic but the
fact of the matter is if you if you want

376
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,929
to loan you want to learn and to help
their anxious for all the help they can

377
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:14,519
get

378
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:18,840
and particularly the building now lie on
the other side of the department and

379
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,330
really kind of solution the relationship
that we're trying to do this you want to

380
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,418
build anyway that's your company is
counting on you guys to be good stewards

381
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:30,059
of your environment and develop those
relationships company delivers enforcing

382
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:35,980
that's really big picture company motto
go to the conference rooms at such and

383
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,639
see the stuff that's on the walls inside
the conference room better mission

384
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:43,370
statements and the personnel a company
all of this stuff built into that and so

385
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,219
you're building into this is really
really something your company is really

386
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,389
answered

387
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:52,949
another tip is it out yet don't know go
down to go down to Walmart or go to the

388
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:57,419
company's supply and get the get fresh
hardhat and try to enter taken to the

389
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:01,489
control room because that again stands
out here's the news here's somebody that

390
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:05,570
doesn't get out in the plant so they
give you a brand spankin new hard hat

391
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:08,509
with a company logo on it so you might
want to take it out the parking lot

392
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:12,159
kicking around show that little wear and
tear on it just to show that you're

393
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,749
you're you're somebody this live through
few things I i dont man I don't

394
00:29:16,749 --> 00:29:20,049
recommend getting actual incidents you
want to go out stay and help people drop

395
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:26,089
stuff on hard-hit entering way we went
on a well-known engagement recently one

396
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:28,719
of the guys from the red team will
charge they were going to a place we got

397
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:33,589
hit hard to choose it got hard so I went
to Lowes and got out but he just bought

398
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:38,309
the shell didn't get the the hardness
inside so the shells kind of flopping

399
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:42,019
around here is how does this thing stay
on it that damn I miss in the strap so

400
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:45,009
yeah those kind of things that's not the
kind of impression that you want you

401
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:48,669
want you wanna get the actual fully
working PPE and it is covered up a

402
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:54,399
little bit that won't hurt you at all
any questions about in this so far of a

403
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:07,149
kind of slow growth is thinking we get
more questions later ok what are some of

404
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:11,299
the resources that you can get we've
we've talked about some of them thus far

405
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:14,299
but there are some things that you can
do it electronically

406
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:22,429
email this that you can get two critical
that again it may be back drinking from

407
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:27,609
a firehose initially but you can get you
begin to get those emails catalog and

408
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:32,439
then you can search inside of your email
client to pick up the juicy stuff that

409
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,349
you wanna know you wanna know what part
believed or about how specifically about

410
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:42,479
rockwell PLC you can do that without
information there but you you get it

411
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:45,859
from this mailing list of discussions
that are on it you can go out mind that

412
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:47,820
my net for more juicy stuff later on

413
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:53,629
a lot of ICS focus security conferences
and they vary these are the ones he's

414
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:59,210
not as you know so there's not a RSA or
some of the DEFCON and black hat over

415
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:03,010
there so there is some ICS content in
this conference it now you don't really

416
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:08,610
about ICS conferences are all focused on
industrial controls in a varying degree

417
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:13,889
they wrote varying degrees of technical
to get it gets started with I'm gonna

418
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:17,710
have to recommend it sounds crazy but
you know the government is here to help

419
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,360
you

420
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:24,810
ICSE AWG DHS effort is very successful
lot of people that that's the first

421
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:28,669
conference in town and it's a way to
learn the landscape in the community

422
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:33,470
find out what some of the topics are
there some technical stuff but there's a

423
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,850
one-time topics as well

424
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:41,129
the S four top export escort conferences
much more attention to the Propellerhead

425
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:46,330
the four assists and four skaters
scientific security summit and it's a

426
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,520
place where there's a lot of research
that shared a lot a lot of stuff it's

427
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,010
more of a deep dive technically as well
as well as more policy and and general

428
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:59,470
informations well sands ICS summit is a
good cross it's a different

429
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:03,350
cross-sections some of these others it's
got a lot to recommend it but it's also

430
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:07,399
fairly expensive but it is if you
already companies already embraced the

431
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,720
sands offerings may give you a good
place to go for six is in europe that's

432
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,960
kind of a stretch but it's a it's
relatively new conference has great buzz

433
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:24,420
around it is a nonprofit that is focused
on the energy sector the SEC stands for

434
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:30,390
security sector but the its focus on the
energy sector energy secretary has a lot

435
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:36,200
of great content it's more grassroots
and informal terrific community a good

436
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,070
place to be able to go in there some
that are like a security so much and

437
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:47,210
some dinner sponsored like by Joe Joe
Watson so-called wife's car now has more

438
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,750
official sponsors help in the fall and
Atlanta so there's lots of conferences

439
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,169
that are available to you these are good
places to learn

440
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:57,850
good place to get engaged with the
community so don't guess Ill just plan

441
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:01,769
on going and soaking up going and plan
on participating asking questions

442
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:05,220
finding you know any good speakers and
asking him questions in the hallway the

443
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,840
Holy track it's almost worth leaving
leading the house for myself so this is

444
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,879
a great place to learn more about what
you like to do

445
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:17,988
information sharing this information
sharing and Analysis county committees

446
00:33:17,989 --> 00:33:24,759
are very big and the information sharing
and Analysis organizations therefore

447
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:29,889
that the ice axe are pretty well
directed at a particular vertical like

448
00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:34,879
water and chemicals the organizations
are going to be much broader there and

449
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:37,330
matter of fact they're gonna be
organized more like around legal

450
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:40,639
accounting integrators

451
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:47,879
broader in their function functionality
but they are focused the idea of ICSI

452
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:51,459
say industrial control systems I
sacrificed in a few years ago it's

453
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:57,799
operated with Chris blast and got a
number of participants and at both end

454
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:02,559
users and vendors and of course the
thing which is almost goes along with

455
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,889
almost any of these conferences in which
you get the folks that are talking

456
00:34:05,889 --> 00:34:09,359
offline about same stuff they were
talking about online during the

457
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,980
conference and just continuing
conversations over your favorite

458
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:17,469
beverage and the beer I second kind of a
broad nickname it's not you know you

459
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:23,109
don't have to like you don't know what
it is she Asian your secret handshake or

460
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:26,739
anything but the ideas it's very
informal information sharing that is

461
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:30,029
hugely interaction community is huge

462
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,940
sometimes

463
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:45,579
gossip and backbiting can be salvaged
but you just gotta take that as part of

464
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:58,380
this part of any help the community
that's true

465
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:04,859
having experienced some of these like I
said some of the findings in the IRC

466
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,270
channels

467
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:12,060
conferences are going on even perhaps
even now can be pretty savage but again

468
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:16,750
there's a time and a passion here and
nobody is in it just for the loans

469
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:20,319
nobody's that I no obvious just just
want just just joined up because I had

470
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:25,900
access to the passion here is in
evidence of how much people want to care

471
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,410
and they want to make a difference

472
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:32,140
mean it is really is a kind of Captain
America's you really trying to make the

473
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:37,319
world better we're trying not to live
and live in the state we were fifteen

474
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:41,240
years ago which is basically the control
system industry with pretty content to

475
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:46,509
just continue on and that's without the
intervention of this community arguably

476
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:52,190
we wouldn't see the progress we've got
now is that what changess aite no two

477
00:35:52,190 --> 00:36:00,339
different note he moves slower than 90
in 2016 you can buy secure Borgir 2005

478
00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:04,859
you could use in future by design was
broken when you got it and it couldn't

479
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:07,299
get you had to go to extraordinary
measures to get it to a level of

480
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,040
security that you could live with in
2016 you can buy securities gear and

481
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,829
that can happen accidentally we didn't
back into that Microsoft did make that

482
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:19,960
happen although Microsoft is as big and
as and using a lot of this and a lot of

483
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,780
these systems that use critical
infrastructure protection equipment

484
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,640
sands didn't make it happen

485
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,549
the government didn't make it happen the
community people people drawing

486
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:34,940
attention to this and and companies are
willing to say we don't want to can you

487
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:38,530
that's old and busted you know when we
use that kind of equipment configuring

488
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,040
that way we gotta

489
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,140
case a new hotness is we don't want that
to happen again I don't want that to

490
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:47,480
happen on my watch and that kind of that
kind of motion goddess of the state

491
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,490
least now we can say that we can put
motivated by you can buy secure will

492
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:56,290
hear that happened by grassroots type
stuff some of it with the government

493
00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:01,590
hands some of it by industry and
regulation compliance with a driver to

494
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:08,060
face facts and we would have gotten here
I think without the community responding

495
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,299
in this fashion I mentioned some books
he's had some books that are

496
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,370
specifically focused on industrial
control systems security and again don't

497
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:18,700
know if you wanna try to copy this can
take a picture of this fine I'll

498
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:25,700
certainly provide all information not
legible on the presentation help us the

499
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:33,960
countdown to zero day I read that comes
later wrote this book it's Elise is

500
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,140
focused on Stuxnet if you want to know
more about sex and that it's a really

501
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,690
good time as a lot of our studies have
been published

502
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,959
dossier by people like Symantec Ralph
Langner is published a lot of material

503
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,240
on it probably knows as much as anybody
about Stuxnet even even some of the

504
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,759
office of the earlier versions that his
firm has done research on it so it's not

505
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:59,270
all all of these things are are there
certainly I see a security-related but

506
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:05,140
they're not not all out how to text box
type type things that are then published

507
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:09,960
is also some that are coming out shortly
and focus

508
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:19,050
condition posed controls focus on it
that's coming there's also a lot of

509
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:23,550
intelligence resources if you aren't
connected up with ICS service is this is

510
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,990
an area that you're interested in
getting connected up I see a search

511
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:32,029
something that I can just visit the
website you have to actually apply to

512
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,880
get granted access to a portal

513
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:38,610
but getting access to something like
that gives you access to my own ability

514
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:42,360
bulletins are published and some of the
road some of the remediation that have

515
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,970
been taking place at that certainly
worthwhile i SAT portals again you gotta

516
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:50,930
join the ice be accepted by the ISEC be
prepared you may be turned down if you

517
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:56,759
are actually a member of that particular
vertical that his services they want to

518
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,790
be particular about the the people that
share the information we have because

519
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:04,240
they don't want people that frankly are
aren't qualified are really interested

520
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,500
in helping to have access as much
information to the folks that are truly

521
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,300
engaging rolled up and her are dedicated
toward improving their second the

522
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,870
company's operations security posture by
providing and subscribing information

523
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:25,900
partners is now a part of me and him are
now part of fire technically eyesight is

524
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:32,530
a is a intelligence firm that published
or rather consumed a company called

525
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:37,170
critical intelligence it was I see a
specific Intel so they went out I bought

526
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:41,700
this icy US Pacific Intel company to
include part of their offerings in a

527
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,980
fire I included in that part of our eyes
off work they do publish things that are

528
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,980
out in the open to those that are
available

529
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:56,290
yes it is and it's it's it's company is
focused on doing threat intelligence I

530
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:59,640
do training and some other things too
but they're focused on basically

531
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:07,560
leveraging threaten to tell just a
better protection than going to a search

532
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:13,020
for those hashtags ICS Esqueda and feels
easier to use that sort of thing or even

533
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,320
a particular vendor like honeywell
rockwell

534
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:19,380
that may may be able to point you to
some interesting interesting articles

535
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:24,450
things that are published those avenues
as well there's a course google is your

536
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:30,680
friend but again the onus the success
the successful Google Trends person is

537
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,649
gonna get in mine information Google you
by asking questions or are a lot of

538
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:39,460
trial and error getting to the questions
that Google is a tremendous resources

539
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,410
being able to collect information

540
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:47,180
their core standards published and I see
a security then going to the standards

541
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:53,308
and best practices that are already
published a good story the list 882 or

542
00:40:53,309 --> 00:41:00,039
yeah it's it's currently its current
vision think they just underwent request

543
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:04,380
for public comment for it was released
to the public feedback including the

544
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,780
next revision it has a lot of practices
and if you're involved with any kind of

545
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:13,390
government facility may not be a good
idea it's a law that's been dismissed

546
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:18,339
800 is the way that most of those months
of the systems are expected to behave

547
00:41:18,339 --> 00:41:25,558
and be covered by ice a 99 was started
in 2002 by a bunch of vendors and

548
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:32,109
end-users and academics basically this
instrumentation or interpretation

549
00:41:32,109 --> 00:41:35,109
automation Society of America the

550
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,829
have standards that around safety
standards that are around alarm

551
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:45,760
management standards around bache bache
flexible batch controls a lot of

552
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,000
standards at a publishing rather go back
to each and every one of those standards

553
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,020
and adding a security section they
decided to make an overarching security

554
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:58,450
standard ISA 1900 so basically all those
other standard ago it would have a

555
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:03,200
heading it said security and that under
it it would say see ISA 990 this

556
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,020
manufacturing control systems this ICS
is the standard is designed to be able

557
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:12,160
to do work is still underway in this
standard is still developing and if

558
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,558
you're interested in pursuing that I
know that I say would welcome

559
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:20,500
dissipation the kind of stopped hope
that a few years ago and outlined all of

560
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,130
the language in the standards to the IEC
standards so the standard can be used

561
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:28,569
internationally and I guess technically
maybe the better title is the second one

562
00:42:28,569 --> 00:42:34,259
sec 243 but I'm old school I say no
that's what I call it and it is the

563
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,869
reference to reference architecture for
security and side of process automation

564
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:46,529
systems is targeted specifically at the
energy generation systems are energy

565
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:47,790
delivery systems

566
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:52,470
its scope and broadening is currently
fifth revision and they used to be

567
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:57,350
generated over a certain certain level a
certain amount that you have to fall on

568
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:00,770
the standards but they're becoming
they're becoming broader its time goes

569
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:05,259
on and becoming less of a checkbox sort
of standard and more of are you acting

570
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:09,460
responsibly you take care of your assets
that's the thing with CFS he had to the

571
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:15,720
chemical facility anti-terrorism
standards and it was designed and DHS

572
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,730
which are by Congress to secure the
chemical sector and the standard as a

573
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:25,170
result of that ACC and other Kim other
chemical means a lot of input into it

574
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:29,440
it's it's a very good standard but its
core it saying can you demonstrate that

575
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,690
you were in control your process at all
times that's kind of the big

576
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:38,240
over-arching question that all the rest
of standard built around so it's that

577
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,729
there are many others that you can go to
many of these are available very easily

578
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:45,390
on the internet just simply go and and
research some download them and begin

579
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:49,950
learning about what the issues are
inside of a particular or even internal

580
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:55,049
control systems altogether by looking at
those standards there of course training

581
00:43:55,050 --> 00:44:00,050
is available I see a certain mentioned
they offered this epic five-day training

582
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:05,420
course that at the center of it is it is
a live red blue training they divide the

583
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:09,830
class into Red Team Blue team and you
attack and actual plant that got an

584
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:13,200
actual plant in a power plant and
everything there inside the building the

585
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,649
blue team is charged with keeping it
running the red team is charged with

586
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:23,490
whatever make him that they can bring
and it's cool it's a 12 hour long long

587
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:28,120
day in which you know they give you some
instruction up to that up to wednesday

588
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,950
and Wednesday you spend rather
terrifying see the pants experience

589
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:36,939
that's a red pink blue team exercise you
know Thursday that Washington discussion

590
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:43,140
what happened you deconstruct everything
and then they provide some supplemental

591
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,370
training on the fifth day I it's really
it's really completely unique are

592
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:50,359
recommended to you again the cost right
it's it's free you just have to schedule

593
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,360
and get Idaho Falls

594
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:58,709
yes it does

595
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:03,280
they they will offer it sometimes some
people coming in and it's just FBI or

596
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,890
just law enforcement or just energy or
just chemicals are just oil and gas in a

597
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:14,049
can continue training like that but I
can't recommend ICS vendor training and

598
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:17,160
go to a lot of a lot of security
training from people like honey will

599
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:24,279
help them attain a BB and Invensys
there's a sans ICS 14 and ICS 515 port

600
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:29,840
and its associated with the
certification and 5:15 is an a so called

601
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,450
back to defense which really about about
handling about doing it

602
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,690
Intel folding what you can gather from
open source intelligence and and page

603
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:43,070
source intelligence into developing and
staying ahead of the threat and inside

604
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:46,650
your individual company there are
several smaller companies boutiques I

605
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:50,360
companies like red tiger security lofty
perch and so it's Kate a hacker that

606
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:57,510
also offer training of various stripes
that you can only 13 appears the ICS

607
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:05,460
certification there's not it's it's it's
really the emerging field there's not a

608
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,560
lot of certification it won't hurt you
to have a CISSP

609
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:14,680
good number of care practitioners and
control systems space I have a CISSP but

610
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:20,009
CISSP really isn't it really wasn't in
seat and thinking about process control

611
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:23,700
systems and there's really nothing about
process control system specific on that

612
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,460
particular certification want her to
have it and in many cases particularly

613
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:32,840
gonna hang out a shingle on your own it
may help you get that you normally might

614
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:38,560
not be considered for you cuz I S is
associated it's kinda like there's not a

615
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,980
professional engineering license for
security but then everyone is not an

616
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:46,020
engineer BRB practitioners inside of the
industrial control systems base that

617
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,990
aren't engineers that came on this case
say that means our lead engineers who

618
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:54,549
came over from the I T side there's a
recent certification that's a global

619
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:59,460
information industrial control systems
security professional CISSP

620
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:08,130
it was developed by GIAC the training
courses the ICS for 10 classes and

621
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:14,680
offers that ensures that I T
practitioners know the basics of ICS ICS

622
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:19,180
people know the basics of security so
it's a noble effort it's constantly

623
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:22,930
being refine and it doesn't say this
person is an expert but it says that are

624
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:29,180
minimally qualified to work with that
said I'm gonna go ahead and look into

625
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:33,190
that if you'd like to learn more about
them and bring more games to your to

626
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:40,480
your ICS so here's again the obligatory
auditory screening links

627
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,480
talk about some of the things we talked
about here about so the government

628
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,900
standards some of the training sites
that there's an excellent library it

629
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:54,080
skated this case a hacker Joel Engle put
together there's lots of emailing list

630
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,779
different different publications that
you can you can follow a course it's

631
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:02,830
constantly changing but this this this
list of links may be a good starting

632
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:52,790
point so still here for you don't do it
actual pen test on the system you do

633
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:55,810
depend tests to prove that you can get
access to the system

634
00:48:55,810 --> 00:49:00,390
ok and that doesn't mean that you get
when you get access to our unnecessary

635
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:05,240
in map against 65,000 to see people
words ok that's that's you just proved

636
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,879
you you get you get a you get a shell
you get a command prompt on the system

637
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,600
from external and that's all you gotta
get this screenshot showing that you get

638
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,589
that far because I don't want to impact
the system occasionally we get the

639
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:22,500
opportunity of going in and doing a
penetration test on a line it's down ok

640
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,160
you got maybe a generation plant before
units in that unit it down for servicing

641
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,750
the ICS is still a lot though and I go
in and I say ok you've got a very

642
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:35,240
specific target here if you can get here
what can you tell me what can you could

643
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:41,209
you look at you actual tree just just to
be able to do that and it has to be

644
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:45,260
orchestrated very very careful like you
said it will be laid out very carefully

645
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:50,050
and even with companies that come in to
a pen test where there's an ICS

646
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:51,420
somewhere in the operation

647
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,770
generally the aidid apartments going up
inside this range of IP addresses don't

648
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:59,540
bother ok don't tell me that you can get
there are you know maybe that's all they

649
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:03,900
want to know can you even see these IP
addresses and that's all that allowed to

650
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,440
do that companies that don't do that
sometimes get a nasty surprise investors

651
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,980
so yeah I got the tunnel then I found a
false account yet you get something

652
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:18,910
happening to you don't want to have
happen it's very rare that you get to

653
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:23,690
work on a live system working on live
system that's it's inert or got a

654
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:27,540
portion of the process down maybe to
shut down for pressure vessel inspection

655
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:31,259
or something but even then they probably
got in Iraq shining and other important

656
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,300
things that they're doing that

657
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:38,030
supporting the shut down operations at
don't want you to assist her to take it

658
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:41,940
down to reboot if they got a life you
know I mention about getting a lap this

659
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:46,030
is another nice if you got a lab
environment then yeah let them run amok

660
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:50,260
you know laptops in and do the torture
testing the pain of death and all that

661
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:55,250
stuff that's another good reason to have
a lab is it you can get a referral test

662
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:58,470
of the environment of course the
challenges the lab isn't a full-scale

663
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:01,330
system and it doesn't have all the
controllers and all the HMO highs and

664
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:04,200
all the activity all the alarms are
going home because it's not making

665
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:10,140
products it's a tiny subset but you can
still learn a lot from that that I like

666
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:10,960
what you think

667
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:15,400
that the stakes are high and you don't
want to run the stories that there's

668
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,930
there's all kinds of stuff about medical
systems inside of hospitals and process

669
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:25,460
control systems that that fell prey to
an end maps came just simply because the

670
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:29,070
networks these devices were never
counting on talking to somebody

671
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:35,720
sixty-five thousand times in the
briefest amount of time they just have

672
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:40,149
nobody ever intended to do that and
another dirty little secret we're

673
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:46,060
talking about these networks these ICs
networks even though they may run on a

674
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:50,320
Gigabit Ethernet or something like that
that their heart they're still these

675
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:54,360
little protocols and they're based on
the network that has made some basic

676
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:58,680
assumptions that no one everyone
everyone on this network belongs and no

677
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:03,930
one who doesn't won't ever be connected
this network whenever these protocols

678
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:08,330
like Modbus and such go back to the days
of eight bits one-stop yet no parenting

679
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:16,040
9600 baud all clear text into packets
are still just like that and you gotta

680
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,090
be careful about this environment and
not break those assumptions because

681
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:22,090
they're just not prepared to take that
kind of track

682
00:52:44,859 --> 00:53:01,900
patching is really hard so hard so hard
proposition alright

683
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,410
even the people of patch will have to
concede they've incurred more downtime

684
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:09,670
from patching than they did from the
Malheur you know that they had you know

685
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:12,670
one contractor attack on their system
that will never change that statistic

686
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:18,140
does con if you've not Petra system
since 2009 Conficker is every bit the

687
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:34,029
threat to you right now as it was in
2009 you could just because just because

688
00:53:34,029 --> 00:53:37,619
you're running Windows XP Service Pack 2
is it was shipped it mean that you can't

689
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:40,950
patch the system you may not be able to
patch it while it's running have to go

690
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:44,319
to your vendor and get a point release
or something like that that has all the

691
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,170
patches rolled up in it but you can take
a shot now I mean all of the systems

692
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:53,400
they run for long periods of time but
not tell you then need to be up a

693
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:58,950
hundred percent the time are you know 59
99 1999 but even asking to give you a

694
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:03,210
window of a day or so per year that you
could apply cash the I can't patch

695
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:06,970
scenario is is a hard one to defend
because the patches after all fix

696
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:14,069
problems they do some of them exist to
prevent an exploit the same exact exist

697
00:54:14,069 --> 00:54:18,460
to prevent a divide by zero and you're
just one bad programming stroke away

698
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:24,749
from pressure system by yourself so
fixing problems are not passing because

699
00:54:24,749 --> 00:54:29,730
I don't incur the downtime is getting
tougher and tougher with hope but you're

700
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:32,630
right there's a lot of that there were a
lot of work allison's on behalf of the

701
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:36,739
operating technology environment I
didn't need to patch the wall full of

702
00:54:36,739 --> 00:54:39,950
instruments are replaced this digital
computer place with a digital control

703
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:45,359
system i didnt eating stinking badges in
a lot of that mindset still around but

704
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:49,480
frankly the run till it rusts doesn't
work with computers are well

705
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,869
fact of the matter is it's a moving
target

706
00:54:52,869 --> 00:54:58,819
you're constantly dealing with the fact
that software I mean basic redmond tell

707
00:54:58,819 --> 00:54:59,480
you

708
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:03,720
Microsoft Windows attached if you're
running on patch windows I don't want to

709
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:08,910
run something window but it's not really
went down oh it says windows on it when

710
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:14,899
you boot up if not passionate and
Redmond OR tell you that we manufacture

711
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:20,400
told you you should stop running
something like a virgin see you know

712
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,400
when symantec has you don't you know
we're giving away

713
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:27,710
pcAnywhere version 13 because you know
all the other ones are old and busted

714
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:30,839
and you should not around them and where
they're giving away the current version

715
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:36,910
you should probably and so that the run
till its robust mentality I just don't

716
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:39,549
think it's going to travel into this
decade

717
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:57,999
really really hard this is hard you know
respectfully though you gotta think

718
00:55:57,999 --> 00:56:03,279
about this in a broader term ok yeah you
put the system in planning a run in

719
00:56:03,279 --> 00:56:07,529
prison for thirty years twenty thirty
years that's that's not actually working

720
00:56:07,529 --> 00:56:12,200
too well you know matter of fact keeping
the hardware that you bought in 2004

721
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,828
running right now it's kind of a
challenge you know a lot of stuff if you

722
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:16,769
were to power at all

723
00:56:16,769 --> 00:56:21,828
power back on you know it's been running
continuously since 2004 but it's you

724
00:56:21,829 --> 00:56:28,249
know one power cycle way from being
planned and the viability of being able

725
00:56:28,249 --> 00:56:32,598
to do that is somewhat difficult in this
day and age again you can buy security

726
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:38,970
equipment in the state yes you that
doesn't mean that you're not going to

727
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:43,930
great frustrations for us as security
practitioners is people use in 2016

728
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:49,230
dollars to buy 20 2005 technology there
willfully deliberately behind the old

729
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:53,989
and busted stuff because it's what
they've already got and when I can't use

730
00:56:53,989 --> 00:56:57,089
the manufacturer to make anymore they go
to Ebay and the junk dealers to get to

731
00:56:57,089 --> 00:57:02,619
buy up all the spares the forklift
upgrade is a real problem that you

732
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,869
describe but there's a lot of room
between

733
00:57:04,869 --> 00:57:09,819
edging ever and forth with and what
we're trying to get people do is get off

734
00:57:09,819 --> 00:57:14,180
at that one position and start migrating
toward the other by picking strategic

735
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:18,220
security architectures and making
evergreen programs working with the

736
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:21,450
vendors that will work with them and
frankly vendor will let you patch it

737
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:25,109
won't let you have great respectfully
you should probably be looking for

738
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:29,680
vendors I mean you know the fighting of
the shortest world's shortest

739
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:35,589
motivational speech I'm actively seeking
to replace you gotta be willing to say

740
00:57:35,589 --> 00:57:56,140
that and mean to get some traction here
now the question frankly even most of

741
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:00,410
the modern hot off the shelf stuff that
you could buy in 2016 the latest

742
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:05,640
versions of peoples like honeywell
invents us their their control system

743
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:09,779
not down to the controllers but at the
DHA my future and workstations servers

744
00:58:09,779 --> 00:58:15,660
they look a lot like I T networks are
used Cisco switch fabrics they use

745
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:22,029
windows and Red Hat Linux Enterprise
they look a lot like the same kind of

746
00:58:22,029 --> 00:58:25,609
gear that I T is it just doesn't fall
into the same domains it doesn't fall

747
00:58:25,609 --> 00:58:27,999
under the same currently eating it

748
00:58:27,999 --> 00:58:36,609
absolute absolute with care with care of
it yes you don't mean and again that

749
00:58:36,609 --> 00:58:40,359
just get you down you know to the to the
top layers of the control system not

750
00:58:40,359 --> 00:58:43,759
down to the controllers you get down to
the later one would think about where

751
00:58:43,759 --> 00:58:46,960
the controllers are and later 0 with the
instrumentation and chill buses are

752
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:51,569
those who work there at all this is not
a protocol where they're not just simply

753
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:56,349
not the equipment design for the
environment there's one last when I

754
00:58:56,349 --> 00:59:00,079
leave you with basically if this is you
got the bug you want to do this here

755
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,910
inside of OT this give you sum up to
give you maybe some action points

756
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:06,839
things that you could do basically would
get home next week

757
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,720
and in three months and then within six
months as an action plan for how you

758
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:17,509
might put the wheels on your on your
desires and import and that I'll take

759
00:59:17,510 --> 01:00:24,090
one more question whether it's in the
next three months find out who inside

760
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:27,930
that organization responsible for
securing ICS if there was an intrusion

761
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:31,810
the ICS went down because the contract
or something like that who who would use

762
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:36,180
phones and finding those people who were
responsible inside the organization

763
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:40,310
would be the next conversation I would
invite this kind of gal

764
01:00:53,440 --> 01:02:12,369
but there's like a GIC SP or some other
certification or went to one of these

765
01:02:12,369 --> 01:02:16,910
classes went to red tiger security class
are often you lofty perch class or even

766
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:19,910
the DHS class on their own

767
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:25,510
can I add that bullet that that's helped
her recognition to the going to like

768
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:29,680
ICICI WJ and learning how to interact
with during his community and he's got

769
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,730
here they came into that came in to help
me

770
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:37,930
the community helped you a lot known I
know they were very well behaved have

771
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:57,440
known you may not be the guy but if you
know some guy yeah by all means let's

772
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,970
let's let's have some conversations and
there they got to look at a time I'm

773
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:05,368
here for the rest of day I'll talk about
this to whatever whatever links that you

774
01:03:05,369 --> 01:03:07,770
want to thank you very very much
