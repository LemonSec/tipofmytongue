1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,740
good morning everyone

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,010
morning besides national my name is Jeff
man I have no security evangelist

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:16,670
strategist product manager few other
things they give me new titles a tenable

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,779
network security every month or so I am
here today to talk about part of the

5
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,100
Jedi mind trick and hopefully you're
here because you want to know what that

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,130
means is my information in case you
wanna get in touch with me and that's

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:38,050
what I used to look like in my younger
days I was cool ones that are not cool

8
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:46,489
now but you you you be the judge what
we're gonna talk about today is first of

9
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:52,669
all I want to disqualify her job I feel
a little bit of my background kind of

10
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,670
talked very briefly about what's going
on and security today

11
00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:01,449
information security cyber security
whatever you wanna call it give you some

12
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:06,658
impressions are some of my ideas about
what I think is missing what we could be

13
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,920
doing better is unity I have to credit
Jason up pretty well this morning where

14
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,790
gave half my part so if you liked with
Jason had the same hopefully this will

15
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:27,640
be an expansion talk about what we can
do in terms of next time so what makes

16
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:34,780
me a Jedi and let me start by asking
does everybody know what it means the

17
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,869
idea of the Jedi Mind Trick or somebody
not know what we have some younger

18
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:41,869
people in the audience who once

19
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:49,469
not only tell it so anybody seen any
version of the movie star wars the

20
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:55,908
reboot of the older ones the idea of the
Jedi mind trick is a scene in the

21
00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:05,560
original reaches episode for discussion
where one of the Jedi Masters is trying

22
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,400
to get somewhere and I have to get some
get past the guards are storm troopers

23
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,660
and then just kind of do little headway
and say these are not the droids you're

24
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,120
looking for and so they were able to get
past the idea of the Jedi mind trick is

25
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,349
you're putting the idea you're putting
your recording what you want people to

26
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:29,859
do what what decision you want them to
make kind of planting that seed in their

27
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,660
head

28
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,500
not necessarily with magic but with
techniques and tricks of the trade so

29
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:43,690
anyway the art of Jedi mind for a long
time ago I began my career

30
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:51,069
33 some-odd years ago working for the
DoD I was there for about 12 years I'm

31
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:55,768
actually classically trained as a crypt
analysts became an information security

32
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:01,560
analyst we call it information security
back in those days was inserted at the

33
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,510
beginning of this whole internet
security pen testing Google hacking red

34
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,340
teaming routine thing twenty-some-odd
years ago and was developing

35
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:16,000
methodologies and testing and doing it
for the government but decided it would

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,389
be a whole lot more fun to do it in the
private sector's about twenty years ago

37
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:23,799
I came out into the commercial world and
started out again doing pen testing

38
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,079
particularly vulnerable assessments and
back in those days it was trying to

39
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:32,209
convince companies look at your gonna be
on the internet you really need to have

40
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:35,919
a firewall and you need to have this
need to have that then you need to have

41
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:41,680
a program in point somewhere along the
lines I fell in the PC I V out there

42
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,050
happen to be PCI QSA we have 12

43
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:51,910
ISA close enough and then another one
there I call it PCI purgatory ended up

44
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,490
being there for ten years and terrible
actually saved me they they hired me

45
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:02,130
about two and a half years ago to be a
PCR subject matter experts to help

46
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,420
tenable products and solutions

47
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:14,510
be able to market a better sell a better
solve the problems better and my biggest

48
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:18,730
challenges actually trying to get my
message about his insecurities sometimes

49
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:24,650
my own company that's a different story
true confession this is where I used to

50
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:31,590
work I have a standing offer if anybody
wants to ask me about my opinion of

51
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:39,789
Snowdon you're welcome to do so tonight
the beers all night but you know buy me

52
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,910
a beer or buy me a drink

53
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:48,840
answer your questions about what I think
about that agency for doing this the

54
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:55,119
whole idea of privacy that's my teaser
to come to the party later when I

55
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:03,100
started out in cryptography almost
thirty years ago gasoline it's been 30

56
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:10,220
years I really AM oh I did manual
cryptanalysis manual cryptography paper

57
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:16,790
systems the things that you see in
museums today you see an old movies but

58
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:22,270
the most secure form of encryption that
in this in the world cannot be broken as

59
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:30,070
a one-time as long as you use it
correctly as long as you only use it as

60
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:35,050
long as you keep the key protected it
cannot be broken

61
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:41,870
that's a familiar theme to you in terms
of cryptography encryption systems today

62
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,910
of course you get into the

63
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:51,050
the bits and bytes in the random there's
thousands of billions and billions and

64
00:05:51,050 --> 00:06:01,680
billions of combinations nobody breaks
crypto these days back wars and of

65
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:09,050
course in terms of cryptography there's
two ends to it and where there's the

66
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,210
whatever you're trying to protect a trip
that has to be encrypted and sooner or

67
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,260
later gotta be decrypted those are the
two weeks where you want to target shirt

68
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:25,909
at don't try to break something the
middle anyway from a recognized this is

69
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,910
going to be audience participation today
what's the movie

70
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:39,940
imitation game and I know what that
thing is that they're looking at make it

71
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,200
easier to put things in context when I
started working for the NSA back in the

72
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:51,060
mid-nineteen eighties it was still a
secret that USA and the UK and allies

73
00:06:51,060 --> 00:07:06,320
new out a break that why would you think
that is the answer quite frankly quite

74
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,440
simply is still countries that were
using it in the mid-eighties thinking

75
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,630
that they had it wasn't it wasn't
revealed that we knew how to break that

76
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:23,570
system I want to say hey that's how old
I am my career in the private sector as

77
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,710
I said I've done a lot of interesting
vulnerability assessment certain

78
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,409
security architecture work basically
have gone into companies try to help

79
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,880
them be more sure

80
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,890
advisers it's been a little bit of a
culture shock for me actually working

81
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:42,830
for a vendor for the last couple of
years but spent most of my career right

82
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,700
way to say it next couple having less
than positive things to say about

83
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,560
vendors in fact I used to have the
attitude

84
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,560
vendors lot they're trying to sell you
something

85
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:59,160
the harsh reality of this industry often
times its companies don't have access to

86
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,460
security experts to consultants to
advisers they turned to the vendors and

87
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,109
of course the vendors magically said
what you need is what I happen to be

88
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,780
sellers

89
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,630
being the exception because I happen to
believe in our products and I think what

90
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,510
our products and you are actually very
helpful and provide a lot of useful

91
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:26,960
information products or animal has me
going around doing talk like this being

92
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,760
sort of a company spokesperson security
evangelist really trying to share and

93
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,900
give back to the community that
something terrible founders really

94
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,000
believe that you know we're in this
together this is this is a community and

95
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,660
there's a large problem has been solved
so people like me go out and about

96
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:54,050
security and in the last year year and a
half going out giving these talks to

97
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,560
security in a bid to lots of different
lots of different conferences and events

98
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:07,150
and not just security other industry
conferences I started noticing the

99
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:13,390
formulation of this talk a lot of smart
people a lot of people given talks fell

100
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:18,080
all the bad things that are going on and
security have lots of great information

101
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,180
to share but at the same time and is
you've even dated a little bit there's

102
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,300
been a lot of really nasty breaches

103
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:33,479
made it to the press and as a as a as a
seasoned veteran veteran security

104
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,370
professional I've been doing
soul-searching and asking myself why is

105
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,209
this why why why was the loving these
major breaches large companies companies

106
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:44,420
that should know better

107
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:51,229
companies that your shot governments
companies are you know better you think

108
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:59,269
that they have their act together and
one of the conclusions that I came to is

109
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:04,040
especially going all these conferences
hearing all these talks about really

110
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:10,829
smart people talking about how stupid
these people are what was Jason was

111
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:18,399
working on the network network guys guys
had been hella pers everybody seems to

112
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,850
have somebody the point management say
they just don't understand it like I do

113
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:33,940
my part was continued to sound like a
copycat from Jays were a season that

114
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,610
turns are onto something you need a
sense of realism you know if you're not

115
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,740
giving you see a problem if you
understand things are wrong and you're

116
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,140
not getting the point across

117
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:50,730
people are hearing you like your
customers or within your own company if

118
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:57,560
you're having a teacher's dirty guy you
know you might be the problem where I'm

119
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,839
going with this talk today is you know
I've spent 20 years being a consultant

120
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,500
going into companies lots of different
environments lots of different

121
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:12,779
adversarial hostile situations
especially being at USA nobody wanted to

122
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:20,110
see the QSA guy come in are you with me
bc I guess they want to get back to

123
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,779
their day jobs they don't know security
audits PCI

124
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:31,500
what's new with what I am how do we make
the school so I had to prove myself I've

125
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:37,390
had to win the right to be heard I iPad
to learn to read situations and occurred

126
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:42,660
to me you know there's a really smart
people probably academics figured out

127
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,089
long ago

128
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,890
names for all the techniques that I just
kind of picked up on it and the years

129
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:52,710
but I still think it'd probably be
useful to share with others as these are

130
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,920
ways that you try to help learn how to
be a better communicators Jason touched

131
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,610
on some of them this morning I hope that
I can expand on that a little bit but to

132
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:10,370
me we're starting with a fundamental
problem and I and I sometimes think that

133
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:15,310
we've got too much technology played in
this business and this is a popular

134
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:20,949
movie we have a lot of shouted out

135
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:37,219
technology is not going away again
because there's so many companies out

136
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,330
there so many news organizations that
don't have security professionals on

137
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,110
staff don't see the need to hire

138
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:49,270
what ends up happening is everybody
falls down on the technology we ought to

139
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,770
buy something that's gonna fix our
problem I give another talk right talk

140
00:12:53,770 --> 00:13:01,089
about sort of one of the buzzwords of
the industry's no such thing is there's

141
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:05,310
no such thing as a silver bullet there
are news there is no one technology that

142
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:10,469
you can put in place is gonna solve all
your problems go away

143
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,760
worries about to go away but the reality
is most companies are out there they

144
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,860
still hold magazines fullest over both
know there is no symbols you've got a

145
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:42,690
sometimes dozens of different
technologies technology so there's a

146
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:51,470
fundamental reliance on technology and
IT security professionals thinking we've

147
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,900
gotta try something different to do
something different

148
00:13:53,900 --> 00:14:04,900
we've gotta change the rules that's my
clue movie which starred track to wrath

149
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:10,810
of Kahn the idea of being in this movie
is sort of a running thing throughout

150
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:19,359
the movie Captain Kirk and by the way
I'm a tricky tricky judge me you will

151
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,839
but the the the the notion in this movie
is happening is people talk about him as

152
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:32,190
being the only kid dead at Starfleet
Academy that ever beat the one of their

153
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,810
final exams which was a test called the
Kobayashi Maru

154
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:43,349
the idea of the tests was simply how do
you react to an unwinnable situation so

155
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:51,040
that the whole sort of a role play their
acting out a situation where the ship

156
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,949
that you're in charge is about to be
destroyed hundreds of people and it's on

157
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:03,070
you remember how do you react to it and
and in the team in the movie is the

158
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,470
captain kirk was the only person that
ever beat the system and at the end of

159
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,880
the movie spoiler alert

160
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:15,839
he might want to see the movie at the
end of the movie he reveals how he beat

161
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,180
the tests and I'll leave it at that
point that essentially he changed the

162
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:26,660
rules he changed changed playing in a
clever way that people in this community

163
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,829
might relate to say that I think this
this meme was out

164
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:37,000
couple months ago hooters and I saw and
I think this kind of encapsulates one of

165
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,850
the big problems that i've seen that
Jason kind of a test test a to this

166
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,920
morning and that is sometimes we in this
community have a little bit of an ego

167
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,339
sometimes we think we're a little bit
smarter than everybody else and we place

168
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:58,690
the blame elsewhere and again I would
suggest maybe we need some blame if

169
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,760
we're feeling it

170
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,740
communicating and getting the message
across if we see the problem and we can

171
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:09,839
communicate solution maybe we need to
try something different so what can we

172
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,300
do what we do better and and this is all
about communication techniques this is

173
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,760
how to be a better persuasive speaker
someone they can get your point across

174
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:28,089
and get decisions made when other people
up to make this so one of the first

175
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:32,810
things that I learned how to do as a
consultant is and there's many different

176
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:37,520
ways of doing this is to you know if
your gonna be going into a company if

177
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,990
your gonna be meeting with your bosses
whatever the audiences

178
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,010
do something to try to get to know them
a little bit was a lot easier these days

179
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:51,680
with Google Talk quite a bit about it
but you know something that I might do

180
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,359
is to simply ask do it now in terms of
let's try to get a feel for what the

181
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,800
group is like new things the best hacker
movie ever made his black never by

182
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:21,079
adding that he raised their hands or how
about warnings about Snickers one

183
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:31,730
Angelina Jolie sorry about that I was
very bad firewalls and what he heard of

184
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:38,870
or seen this movie of swordfish I picked
out movies I've seen over the years that

185
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,570
had some sort of not so much accuracy
and terminology but maybe more the

186
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:49,770
methodology about enemy of the state one
there I like that one just cuz it's

187
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:53,770
about where I used to work there's a
scene in enemy of the state where the

188
00:17:53,770 --> 00:18:00,139
the bad guy is like a deputy director
for NSA who actually know that position

189
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,850
exists I used to work for them they're
coming to work in this big stretch

190
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:08,610
limousine all the serious dark windows
or darken and they're driving down this

191
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:14,149
ramp in the world are pretty glass
buildings we can see inside and I've

192
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:19,310
always trouble because that's real that
ramped up the loading dock really bring

193
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:24,310
in the food area primarily nobody goes
in that way

194
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:30,469
somebody was suggesting that maybe I
need to update this how do we reach the

195
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:35,880
younger crowd today so I've been working
on thinking about how do we update the

196
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:43,280
slides so let's just say that the best
hacker being out their duties and what

197
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,639
is it mister Roboto I am I am robot

198
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,140
really thinking I Robot

199
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:10,030
language so he factors effective
communication when you're trying to

200
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:16,899
educators teach is start by listening
and that that serves multiple purposes

201
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:23,860
want is you want to get to know your
audience and get a frame of reference

202
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:29,010
are being Jason talked about finding a
common common reference that's one way

203
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:34,580
to do it I actually think you sometimes
maybe often need to take that a little

204
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:40,908
bit further in not only find common
ground common both know about which is

205
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:44,039
legitimate but sometimes I think you
need to go beyond that and actually

206
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:48,950
enter their find out what their dream of
references were fair common ground News

207
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:53,549
and go to them and you can do this by
listening to hear what they're talking

208
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:57,710
about I used to do it

209
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,370
Jason mentioned it to you if you're if
you're a consultant and you're going

210
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,820
into a company or even if you're within
your company going your bosses all

211
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:14,539
they've got on their deaths have
pictures they have in their early days I

212
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:22,830
used to go walking around and see what
dole burkhart team goes to my kids

213
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,889
you're really good clue as to what
corporate culture is like when you find

214
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:33,360
out what people think or the funny
dilbert later on it was the movie office

215
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,770
space in but it seemed that

216
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:40,310
you know you know the favored Dilbert
cartoons raises do what's your favorite

217
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:45,830
scene in the movie office space but
listening gives you the ability to start

218
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:53,179
dealing out what people are into you so
you can share mine oh this person's a

219
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:59,700
big hockey fan over this person's big or
little this person doesn't like sports

220
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:05,680
at all but they're in the car you know
so and that gives you the responsibility

221
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,900
to learn it's been a little bit learned
about something else so that when you're

222
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,890
trying to explain what you're trying to
explain it to you can try to put it into

223
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:19,810
terms they understand using analogies
using stories trying to use the language

224
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:27,080
that they're familiar with for example
and I apologize and regional audiences

225
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:34,429
in football fan fair few people gotta if
you're on defenceman you're trying to

226
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:38,660
chase down a running that on the other
team that's turning the corner and

227
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:43,380
heading down the field your say the
middle linebacker if you turn and try to

228
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,820
his straight to where the person is by
the time you get there is way down so

229
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,300
you have to actually turn and pick up
point down field runner try to intercept

230
00:21:52,300 --> 00:22:01,409
there there Pats up that's a great
analogy people vote football if you

231
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:09,910
don't know football nobody knows what I
just said not technically a movie is

232
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:19,830
everybody's seen that commercial where
their eyes on the phone asking the

233
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:24,820
operator of the support guy you guys
have fraud protection right guys

234
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,570
fraud protection we have that you mean
fraud protection yeah fraud protection

235
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:33,120
ok we're speaking the same way I totally
get riches

236
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:43,900
they were in agreement so make sure that
you know when you have an audience when

237
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:49,110
you're trying to get your point across I
think it's important to speak their

238
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,429
language is under business

239
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:56,520
the language is going to be a business
conference which means talking about

240
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,480
money talking about the drivers talking
about the investment talking about how

241
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:12,460
this is going to help our bottom line
it's something I learned early on is to

242
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:18,750
not to say things once and assume that
they get it sometimes you need to

243
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:31,060
regroup and and and try different tax
person to you have to keep trying and

244
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:38,909
not become in patients and not become
Jason's hurdle is not become a jury by

245
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:49,720
getting it doesn't get here listening if
you're learning about the audience

246
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,700
talking to a person that you're talking
to hopefully that gives you an idea of

247
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:02,400
how to tell stories tell now it's put it
in terms of pay understand I've even

248
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,520
been to talks where people talk about
the need to communicate better and dumb

249
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:12,850
it down to talk now want a 239 technical
crowd and then they proceeded to give my

250
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:16,899
opinion it's extremely technical but
they think that they don't the town they

251
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:21,260
think that they're speaking terms and if
you look around in the audience and

252
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:26,890
salsa not techy water so tell stories

253
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,970
put it in terms that they understand
learn to speak their language I

254
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,260
mentioned I was a creepy so I have the
occasion to talk about

255
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:41,759
topography and encryption in the PCI
world where you're supposed to be

256
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:47,269
encrypting card data now become popular
to encrypt it from the Swype device from

257
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:53,809
the point of sale and people are wanting
to talk about all these fancy terms of

258
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:55,789
you know algorithms

259
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:59,379
size elliptic curves this that and the
other

260
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:05,830
tell you most street retailers most
companies merchants that have to do PCR

261
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:10,869
first thing about cryptography such
first try to break it down into really

262
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:15,249
really simple terms you got something
that you want to protect called readable

263
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:20,320
tax and you're gonna do some really
complicated math so that's represented

264
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,099
just buy a plus sign as you're adding
something and you're using a variable

265
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:30,269
which we call key which is the secret
random stuff and that produces something

266
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:37,419
I had this slide to talk about a year
ago somebody walked up to me afterwards

267
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:42,229
and said I just exam and you explain
more about poverty than I ever

268
00:25:42,229 --> 00:25:46,470
understood my whole training session
just buy out and that this was the slide

269
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:54,419
so this is sometimes hard for tickets to
break it down into simple terms I

270
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:59,320
oftentimes will catch myself when I'm
trying to break things down into simple

271
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:06,200
search terms thinking well technically
getting it wrong here I can pick apart

272
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,149
the logical one saying but I'm still
speaking in broad terms that I think

273
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:12,488
will get their point across

274
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:17,909
gonna pick up on what I mean I just hope
they don't know the detail but sometimes

275
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,030
you have to do that to speak to
non-technical audiences

276
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:42,490
come to a point of understand already
gave away the movie and this one in his

277
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:49,130
claim to fame was from the movie and
office space for the tagline no no

278
00:26:49,130 --> 00:27:00,240
that's not a lot of people person he's a
communicator his job was to take the

279
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:11,250
specs from the customer to the engineers
that's right he grew so again if you're

280
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:15,160
a people person if your communicator
that means you got to engage the people

281
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:28,450
listen to learn a little bit about the
different ways this one in in there to

282
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:46,700
this movie is usually a stopper but it's
a Christmas movie give up I'm sorry

283
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:56,649
yeah I think you're onto something the
long kiss goodnight very good so Samuel

284
00:27:56,649 --> 00:28:01,869
L Jackson Jackson in the movie long kiss
goodnight as a as a line where he says

285
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:10,939
go make an assumption because you always
make an ass out of you and I'm so so I

286
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,080
have found this to be true in my in my
years because I think I've done a great

287
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,939
job explaining something and I learned a
trick along time ago I will stop and say

288
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,450
we did you just hear me know what you
know

289
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,609
communicate back to me what I just tried
to communicate to you and nine times out

290
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:34,349
of ten I've blown it because they're not
on the same page which means I gotta try

291
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:38,289
again I gotta try different story again
try a different tactic to try to find

292
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:41,289
different comment

293
00:28:45,669 --> 00:29:01,359
somebody abusing him it wasn't his fault
was there sort of the same principle let

294
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:06,099
slip it you know if somebody's not
understanding you it may not be there

295
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:18,749
fall very possibly be your fault not
very well that's a great point I mean I

296
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:23,269
literally used to practice at the dinner
table if I could get my kids or my wife

297
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:27,789
is not a technical person to understand
what you know whatever I was trying to

298
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:32,690
get up trying to get across the current
customer I brought by the family dinner

299
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:36,219
table that they got to a point where
their understanding that I thought I was

300
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:40,099
on to something like eight maybe this
this is where I need to get my wife is

301
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:43,099
greater coming up with analogies I stole
from her

302
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:52,580
a non-technical example of this of how
how we build indicated times have you

303
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,629
ever done this review ever seen somebody
trying to communicate with someone that

304
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:03,970
stuff or someone has to be supported
language what we tend to do as humans we

305
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:12,610
speak loudly and we speak slowly does it
were no you can speak as loud as slowly

306
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,428
as you want to me and just about any
other language understand a word

307
00:30:16,429 --> 00:30:24,919
American and I only speaking the
darkness Jason didn't mention this one

308
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:31,130
again 21 times when I'm this was also
this was especially true when I will be

309
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:37,039
doing an assessment have to go in and
present results Jason talk about your

310
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:42,010
don't just crush them with you know this
is what's bad and is very true you you

311
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:45,760
need to kind of work up to her and the
lessons that I learned many years ago

312
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,408
and easy to put this new video titles
right there

313
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:56,639
start with something positive my life
lesson was actually my father told this

314
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,409
to me and I'm scarred to the state
because of it I never got straight A's

315
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:07,610
as a kid smart kids it was bored
actually you did all the homework one

316
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:11,770
time I got was trying to get straight
A's closest I ever got was like sixties

317
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:18,129
and so I brought her my report card
showed up to my dad and first thing out

318
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:25,700
of his mouth was wide and that's on a
new bus that so you know I would go into

319
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,700
clients and and try to start with you
know

320
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:35,790
made up scenario you know your website
that we were attacking the layout the

321
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:41,850
snoring the color schemes or $0.09 very
pretty but you know when you start using

322
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:48,240
some of the things that are wrong it's
not so good we found some some your

323
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,530
program here is cross-site scripting
secret injection or whatever

324
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,600
oh my gosh we were doing signal
injection twenty years ago before we

325
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,879
even that name and then you get into the
really ugly things like no you're using

326
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,700
default out of the box

327
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,140
programming consists of the website then
there's all sorts of default settings we

328
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,580
found no password it was all over

329
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:15,139
ease into it you're more likely to get
them on board with where you're going

330
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:19,750
because near the message that you need
to start over brats and do something

331
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:24,170
different you need to provide training
usually it's going to cost money which

332
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:29,740
is what our customers your customers are
fossils that's that's the bottom Harper

333
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:36,180
the news leaders how much is it gonna
cost so this is not exhaustive these are

334
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,200
just some of the techniques that I
picked up over the years that I thought

335
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,470
you know I've always felt like a fairly
good at developing a report of my

336
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:50,160
customers so these are some of the
things I thought that these are some of

337
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:55,010
the things that maybe I should be
sharing to others especially in sort of

338
00:32:55,010 --> 00:33:02,379
the hackers security community we have a
reputation sometimes and I think it was

339
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:07,150
why we had such an entertaining you know
this morning not being people people

340
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:11,850
persons of not being easy to get along
with being a little bit egotistical

341
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:18,370
little bit jerky sometimes because we
know more than everybody else there's a

342
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:21,510
guy here that speaking this afternoon I
heard him refer to the knot

343
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:29,150
smuggles funny unless you're the Muggle
you know what he's getting so anyway

344
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:37,799
what we need to do differently but
sometimes it might seem so overwhelming

345
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:47,700
that I know what you're thinking why
didn't I take my encouragement to you is

346
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,909
no dive into this try to think about how
to communicate more effectively don't

347
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:56,950
give up because it is you know when you
know it all when you take in the red

348
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:02,250
pill it really really is pretty ugly and
security is so complex and there's so

349
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:06,210
many levels and so many facets of so
many things that have to be done and so

350
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,668
many people have to know that we can be
overwhelming I'm overwhelmed they've

351
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:14,980
been doing it for 33 years one of one of
the talks are around and gives basically

352
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,290
I've been doing this for 33 years
nothing's changed

353
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,529
technologies lot faster things are
moving a lot faster

354
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:29,690
we've got new things to worry about like
the cloud local that's not nearly all

355
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:40,159
these little computers are just crazy if
you're an old person sometimes you might

356
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:46,869
want to think about giving up
encouraging not I've heard people give

357
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:53,000
talks and presentations talk again
referring to this whole thing is a game

358
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,280
as an analyst analyst person is an
information security hours I've been

359
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,720
trained to do everything a puzzle when
you think of things as a puzzle you're

360
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,709
trying to solve something you're trying
to come to a solution and many times

361
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:15,410
more than one solution on absolute
weight so you try something and bill for

362
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:19,540
something different and I'm not just
talking about technical problems that

363
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,430
you're trying to solve what i'm talking
also about getting your message across

364
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:28,890
others treated as a positive he saw how
can I get this accomplished how can I

365
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:31,830
get to the goal where their
understanding with me

366
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:41,759
and and hopefully acting in responding
the way I think they need to respond in

367
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,530
terms of the ego building a trust
relationship building a rapport

368
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:52,399
for my analogy again as a consultant
he's done and I've done it I used to go

369
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,140
in and specially with PCI I used to come
in and say look where your problems I

370
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:03,339
know you know your network better than I
do you know what the problems are you

371
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:07,020
know you've been trying to get your
bosses to invest in whether its

372
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:13,710
technology training resources more
people I know I'm your best friend right

373
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:18,440
now you don't know that but because I I
can put a label of PCI audit guess what

374
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:24,190
you'll get it and they were really happy
when I slap PCI on something this party

375
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:30,090
gettin building trust relationships that
helps the end game which is to make the

376
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,510
company more secure

377
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:38,430
it's also very important to note and
hopefully most of us understand this but

378
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:43,370
security is not really a state it's not
like ok we're gonna get to the top of

379
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,100
the mountain done

380
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,720
security is a is a process it's a
lifestyle this is something you do if

381
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,220
your know what you're doing with
security you know you're never done you

382
00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:02,129
know that you always have to be diligent
I like to refer to it being paranoid the

383
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:06,120
best jury people are necessarily
paranoid I think you need to be

384
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:11,910
appropriately paranoid any of us to
particle board on it

385
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,759
password you can plug which you can know
that there's holes out there that you

386
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,820
can plug keep your eyes that's my way of
breaking it down just

387
00:37:23,890 --> 00:38:16,500
part of it is you know you've got that
were being a hacker that just a magical

388
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:23,740
stuff things get room admin access you
know if you do that kind of stuff if

389
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:29,660
your pen tester nine times out of ten
you just know more about what is now

390
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:38,470
works with the weaknesses are often part
of the feature really you just know more

391
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:43,308
than somebody else it's not really that
magical when he you know when you know

392
00:38:43,309 --> 00:38:48,170
what it's all about but yeah there's a
perception problem and and that's part

393
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:51,529
of the communicating that's part of the
trust relationship making it a

394
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:57,200
partnership being as paranoid as you
need to be beings churches need to be

395
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:07,390
harsh reality we're not in the security
business when the risk business is an

396
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:12,970
article on november the details that
there is a lawsuit was filed couple

397
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:19,078
months ago against the penetration
testing company the did forensics as

398
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:23,630
well because the company they were a
company hired them to do forensics work

399
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:29,130
and they didn't find the root cause
fundamental problems caused a compromise

400
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:36,519
came back later to bite them and so the
company was angry and privacy and

401
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:41,118
testing friends with the lawsuit
probably don't know what the current

402
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,910
status but it's not going to go anywhere
because there's this fine print in the

403
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:49,899
contract from the agreements company
that most companies that you know your

404
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,609
pen testing company right Carrington
you're finding all the props if you're

405
00:39:53,609 --> 00:40:00,288
any kind of security technology
consultant whatever you have a good SLA

406
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:05,460
service level agreement you've got
disclaimers in there saying there's no

407
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,509
guarantee that we're finding everything
we're gonna we're gonna find a lot of

408
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:12,490
stuff to try to plug big goals but no
guarantees that sort of one of the

409
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:15,919
realities of this industry especially
from the consultant perspective

410
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:22,750
companies don't always like to hear that
breached again but that's that's that's

411
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:33,960
a perception issue so I know what that
movie where the moral life lesson a word

412
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,769
games is this isn't terms of nuclear
arms raised the political message is

413
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:49,359
it's it's there's no matter what game it
was a tractor thermo

414
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:56,150
global thermonuclear war but it was
really a game of tic-tac-toe that they

415
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:01,420
used to teach the computer that tic tac
toe with both sides know what they're

416
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:07,700
doing W wins so the only logical
solution but again we talked about it

417
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:13,160
being a game very often in the industry
I like to think of it as a possible what

418
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,769
this means is my most recently added
slide

419
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:47,430
about six yes he does and the premise is
an assay as design super secret code but

420
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:52,649
to test it they they take out ads in
magazines and then they put puzzles in

421
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:57,210
the back of the magazines and the
puzzles encrypted with their super

422
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:03,190
unbreakable former corruption and if you
happen to be able to break the puzzle

423
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:07,770
you get a if you solve this
congratulations please call this eight

424
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:11,470
hundred-number and they have a bunch of
them out there so the guys at an assay

425
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:16,640
one day all of a sudden the phone rings
causes never run before because it's not

426
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,140
supposed to be a breakable that this kid
who is autistic and they it's a real

427
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:26,319
cheesy movie cuz he just looks at it and
it blurs of becomes that our citizens

428
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:33,790
just magical because that's how hackers
are but I put the slide him because you

429
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:39,460
know the way I literally got a job at an
assay thirty years ago was I took a

430
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:44,690
battery of tests were basically a bunch
of puzzles and it wasn't good you solve

431
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:49,430
them but it was like how well you do
it's all but one of the one of the tests

432
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:56,500
was trouble but it was like looking at a
geographic shape they would have the

433
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:01,060
two-dimensional shape on the page and
they'd say what is this geographical

434
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:08,000
shape look like from a buck or from
behind and then I guess I was good at

435
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,990
that I don't know if people struggling
with a pyramid look like straight game

436
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:22,230
the square anyway I threw that in there
just because I happen to like puzzles

437
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:27,730
and had that made me good at being an
analyst that got me and they got me into

438
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:33,650
this career as people come up to me and
asked me how do you get into it I also

439
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:39,079
when I first started when we didn't have
literally I didn't have shooters when I

440
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:45,200
started but we're pretty soon got IBM
xSeries eighties when we got a hard

441
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:51,490
drive on it a bit hard drive in a still
that brings before Windows young people

442
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:59,828
got into Unix workstations the first
networks for Unix pace in there was a

443
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:07,670
stupid game the king of all units where
I got addicted to Spider Solitaire over

444
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:14,410
to play it to this day and I always will
replay it do I beat it and you know I

445
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:27,399
maybe once a year or give up and not
addictive personality that runs in this

446
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:34,059
you know so final thoughts wrapping this
you know understand you're trying to

447
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:41,200
change the culture times and really
tight and it would have done a whole lot

448
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,250
better have a better writer and the
steered more

449
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:48,890
more quickly you know that's a pretty
common analogy trying to steer the

450
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:54,170
Titanic trying to change the rules like
trying to talk to a very true not only

451
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:57,110
within the companies we work for our
customers

452
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:01,750
terms of our community itself right to
think things through differently trying

453
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:13,420
a different approach takes awhile so
somebody asked me to talk to you do see

454
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:20,710
the need to do something to lead by
example be the one that's humble be the

455
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:24,980
one that tries to communicate the one
that reaches across the aisle to the

456
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,140
other organization

457
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:32,440
Jason was talking about you know he has
a special fund assumes hard for

458
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:39,470
networking guys but as aqsa I would have
to go into companies and you know the

459
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,790
first section is all about the
networking site up to talk to the

460
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:47,750
network guys in the next sections all
about server light output throw to first

461
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:54,970
the Unix Linux and Windows guys they
don't get along to talk to people about

462
00:45:54,970 --> 00:46:00,720
the encryption and that was usually
talking to the apps people and it dave

463
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,270
is being stores probably stored in a
database and then I had to start talking

464
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:08,340
to the DBA's and you're very often I
talked about you know I'd start with the

465
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:11,650
network and say well whereas all the
sensitive data where the servers that

466
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:15,900
have a credit card information I don't
know you like screen

467
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:22,550
network up and I talked to the server
guys were absolutely on these servers or

468
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:29,110
what was the date of Florida I don't
know my job even the DBA's you talk to

469
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:29,680
them

470
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,000
you give me the schemas for the database
where's all the sensitive information

471
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,200
stored make it this wide

472
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:45,210
they don't care so sometimes we do it
ourselves we place this eilers isolation

473
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:50,880
for each other I'm very literally
literally very often walk away from

474
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,810
their company knowing more about their
overall operations data flows business

475
00:46:55,810 --> 00:47:00,880
processes than any one person I talked
to a few oldtimers in the room the

476
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,610
exception would be there be some guy
that started at the company's thirty

477
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:10,250
years ago in the mailroom and became a
mainframe programmer in New COBOL and

478
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:13,170
they hired him back of y2k

479
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:19,140
history from young people and he's the
one knew how everything works in New

480
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:24,049
where everything was all the systems
those guys are going away those guys are

481
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:28,330
fading I've talked very often

482
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:40,000
terms of how I can speak tech I can
speak 92 I think it's important to be

483
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,440
able to speak the language of the people
here talking to that helps to earn the

484
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:51,400
trust that helps to build bridges that
helps to respect the techies don't tend

485
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:57,650
to like to talk to others so sometimes I
had to prove myself I had to explain the

486
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:03,570
one guy that was like an era por si so
ran us off at a retail merchant white

487
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:11,710
light it was the DoD and family remember
client-server terms of applications the

488
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:17,540
concept is pretty simple concept one
server running a nap and a lot of

489
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:22,270
clients they're talking back with a one
to many relationship they had

490
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:29,020
implemented a solution where the server
they put out a thousand different stores

491
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:35,130
listening and the client was one or two
clients of the admins you something that

492
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:38,490
happened to be running Secure Shell
waiting

493
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:43,879
helmet but because it had to run tell
dat meant the telnet daemon was running

494
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,400
a thousand times over a thousand
different stores they have a thousand

495
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:53,730
servers as that of a thousand class for
hours to convince him you've implemented

496
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:57,920
this backwards and you haven't solved
the problem still got home now

497
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:04,970
stores once he finally got it and he was
he was the worst in terms of adversarial

498
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:08,540
that I ever encountered and didn't want
to give me the time of day but he

499
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:13,300
begrudgingly respected me as I know a
little bit about what we talked but it's

500
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:18,310
a long time anyway sometimes you have to
sometimes you have to put yourself out

501
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:24,080
there to gain the respect and earn the
trust but it's important to be able to

502
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:31,470
speak multiple languages and at this
point in my career i feel like im I

503
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:36,160
don't have any more interesting I knew
the concepts I can still talk about it

504
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,960
but I'm much more interested in becoming
a teacher and I try to be a teacher

505
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,560
communicate I i take the risk of
offending the dentist was in the room

506
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,009
and say you know breaking things as a
whole lot easier

507
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:55,230
trying to create something and even
harder it is to talk to the people that

508
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:58,600
have no clue about anything that you're
talking about but just trying to run

509
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:03,490
business trying to convince them or
explain to them why this all matters and

510
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:13,890
why they care what that's kind of what
time was we can talk for about five or

511
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:16,890
ten questions

512
00:50:29,220 --> 00:51:30,480
is a good illustration about how a lot
of what I'm talking about can be

513
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,430
construed as really upon the social
engineering that is the art of the Jedi

514
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:42,868
Mind at its core but again sometimes you
need to be going to go beyond the social

515
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:48,380
engineering aspects of different planes
that level of understanding and treating

516
00:51:48,380 --> 00:52:03,500
other questions comments just if you're
interested in talking if you're

517
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:11,000
interested in a workshop training course
at Circle City which is in June trying

518
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,780
to give the students will sign up an
opportunity to put this in the practice

519
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:20,180
practical exercises I think a lot of us
sometimes don't get the opportunity to

520
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:24,419
speak whether it's in a group setting
whether it's public speaking of these

521
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:31,609
sides as great as it gives people an
opportunity to speak in a public people

522
00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:37,160
suggest Toastmasters masters in your
area a little club where you

523
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:44,260
talks that's that's what I like today

524
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:51,029
other questions

525
00:52:51,030 --> 00:54:08,820
figure out the the Hawks take it to the
next level of course there's always new

526
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:13,510
technology coming that needs to be
broken people need to figure that out

527
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:17,010
but at the end of the day and in the
grand scheme of things that the only

528
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:25,950
thing I can come up with is a consistent
6 you will is understanding training

529
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:27,089
awareness

530
00:54:27,089 --> 00:54:34,549
company-wide is no explaining to the
lowest level secretary person why it

531
00:54:34,549 --> 00:54:40,269
matters what they do and what their
actions and inactions how it impacts

532
00:54:40,269 --> 00:54:45,129
overall operation and and you know that
that addresses the decision campaigns

533
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:50,229
spam emails all they come and go as you
can explain and educate people and it's

534
00:54:50,229 --> 00:54:55,169
more than just you know taking that 21
questions online quiz once a year

535
00:54:55,890 --> 00:55:00,950
change your password password it's
really given context and meaning in

536
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:07,660
understanding and helping companies to
become aware of what the implications of

537
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:12,700
the ramifications are used to have
specially the merchants the PC I can

538
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:16,879
tell me all the time abuse planning what
it all meant the background the context

539
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,509
of a door and say yeah but you know we
saw women's clothing we don't we don't

540
00:55:21,509 --> 00:55:27,089
need DOD level security well I'm sorry
to say but the rules of change these

541
00:55:27,089 --> 00:55:33,140
days the playing field is changed what
used to be in terms of PCI the beliefs

542
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:38,089
that an attacker's gonna go after the
twenty million any million cars are

543
00:55:38,089 --> 00:55:42,599
stored in a database gonna be a one-time
penetration they get in they get out and

544
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:46,799
that's what you're protecting against
that's not how it works anymore those

545
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:52,299
clever guys and gals figured out how to
harvest cars wanted to time from a

546
00:55:52,299 --> 00:55:57,829
thousand little mom-and-pop shops
harvested in 10 innings and it might

547
00:55:57,829 --> 00:56:01,969
take a week or a month or two or three
but they don't care because nobody's

548
00:56:01,969 --> 00:56:07,900
detectable as a flying under the radar
so the paradigm shift the rules of

549
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:08,589
change

550
00:56:08,589 --> 00:56:12,920
nobody ever thought that you would
bother going after one or two cards or

551
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:17,979
10 cars from the small merchants because
you're not going to invest because you

552
00:56:17,979 --> 00:56:22,098
don't get the bank well unfortunately
the banker buckles now you can do that

553
00:56:22,099 --> 00:56:26,460
we can do it relatively unabated doesn't

554
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:40,560
hundreds of so the gains the game has
changed we at we need changes I can try

555
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:49,009
to hackers charity organizations in
their approach to raise money to provide

556
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:57,510
technology in computer in Africa and
Uganda Uganda's a country that's been

557
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:06,910
worked worn for many decades there was a
world where that was operating a new job

558
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:15,580
for many years now finding safe harbor
in south of the way we go into villages

559
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:20,619
that had no mass communications with
Jill everybody still all children make
