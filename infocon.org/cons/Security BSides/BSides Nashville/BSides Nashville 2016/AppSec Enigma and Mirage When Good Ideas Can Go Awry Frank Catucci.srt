1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,480
I saw a lot of hands go up in Jason's
talk for people that have never come to

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,090
UAB sides event before so I will be as
gentle as possible

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,810
one quick thing about B Sides as I
really like the community and people who

4
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,640
come to bsides events people who give up
their saturdays and weekends for InfoSec

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,719
I feel it's a real good culture and a
good a good point for learning one quick

6
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:43,670
thing is that this is a green track talk
I've never done agree track talk before

7
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,930
so that's a first for both I change the
slides and this is the first time I

8
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,820
presented this talk at all so like Jason
there will be a little bit of trial and

9
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:01,449
errors we go I have a red track version
but that's not what this one is so

10
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:11,490
without any further do who am i well as
you can see from your brochure my name

11
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,658
is Frank and I have little bit of a
sense of humor here so I'm not going to

12
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:24,970
be as dry and I'm currently director web
application security research and

13
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:31,640
subject matter expert for Qualys I'm
bull's eye looked a lot older than I

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,780
look my youngest daughters I'm in my
oldest daughter saris turning 20 so that

15
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,939
gives you any idea I've been doing this
for a very long time mostly focused an

16
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,658
application security now you know I like
to build things I'm really good at

17
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:54,780
breaking things I am a farmer
legitimately own in work farm as well so

18
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,840
worried about that

19
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,840
outdoors anything related

20
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:08,759
yes so I'll admit that I have a Kubota

21
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,530
I don't I don't have a job yet it's been
hacked few times for different methods

22
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:21,170
one of the hydraulics in the front been
hacked together to exceed the weight

23
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:26,380
limit for the pocket but little things
like that you know one quick thing about

24
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,920
what this talk will be again it really
is a green talk version I have never

25
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,319
done a green talk but I've always wanted
to so if anyone has any questions just

26
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,540
feel free to really like just interrupt
me anytime and ask and I can clarify

27
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:48,329
anything that we need to go it will stay
up sex century it won't contain any

28
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,600
question questionable language today as
we have children in the room which I

29
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
always welcome so scratch that out and
I'll do my best

30
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,260
the contents concealed that eyes there's
one vulnerability that I'll be showing

31
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:09,510
that has not been patched so I won't
discuss the details of that because I

32
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,560
won't lie I don't feel like discussing
the possibility but we'll get to that

33
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:25,010
I'll give you some of my opinions but
the main just this is to be an insured

34
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,840
application security to basically show
you that even though sometimes the best

35
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,820
intentions and thought processes are put
into developing integrating security and

36
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:40,410
your web application that sometimes just
that's not enough and I'm trying to help

37
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,140
you avoid some of the same stakes real
quick disclaimer nothing I'm showing you

38
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:50,208
has any affiliation association
endorsement with company policy this is

39
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:55,989
mostly 100% my research anything that
has to do with any of our clientele or

40
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:59,920
anything like that is not included in
this talk anything that I did you hear

41
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,089
is either independent to bug crowd
hacker one or something and I won't show

42
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,940
any exploits did you follow my twitter
be warned there now is perfect for

43
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,250
someone her size

44
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:19,100
but it's my personal account so without
further ado if someone ever asks really

45
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,750
wants a general idea of what application
security your web application security

46
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:28,820
consists and why it's difficult to make
a web application security first have to

47
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:36,440
look at a general tired definition that
may vary over the years but you're

48
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,230
essentially wanting to secure code that
is a web application your salsa securing

49
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,990
any back-end systems are third-party
libraries that you reference for use in

50
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:51,490
your code securing all the servers and
configurations of that code your code

51
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,380
and all web browsers are essentially a
perimeter so your code is a perimeter

52
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,370
but not only that your web security from
browser point of view is also your edge

53
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:06,300
so what people don't understand there
too is that that's also a perimeter it's

54
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,790
really hard to secure all of these
moving parts because the two coats

55
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,860
changing and I tell people all the time

56
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,260
one thing to remember is that developers
might have to write millions and

57
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:22,169
millions of lines of code huge multiple
development environments that could be

58
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:26,010
outsourced to could be in house it can
be different parts of code thats been

59
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,810
written in India in the United States
and Japan like all of this code comes

60
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,340
together million lines of code all I
have to do is break one of those lines

61
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,969
of code rights to all if he was fined
one bad mistake I did these millions

62
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:43,120
lines could from all these different
people so it's really difficult but why

63
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,270
is it important the main reason why I
think it's important is because how many

64
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:53,770
people here do business with a company
strictly online no relationship with the

65
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,539
business whatsoever except for an online
press I'm gonna get everybody has at

66
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:05,710
least one that used eBay or Amazon or
something like that or your bank right I

67
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,080
rarely ever walk into my bank most of my
stuff start online I mean granted you

68
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,370
have to go in sometime but you know if
you had a lie banker your insurance

69
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,470
company how many people walk in their
insurance companies or

70
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,320
you don't work there so i mean but
there's a lot of companies out there in

71
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,500
their your soul relationship is through
the web and it's just it's your front

72
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,250
line it's your image to your business

73
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,340
one thing to that makes web application
security difficult is that web

74
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,679
applications are constant changing
there's constantly code updates are

75
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,040
constant boner abilities being found
just constantly new release cycles and

76
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,110
information in it it's pretty much
dynamic your web applications are

77
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,660
essentially always up and those are
basically you're up time for your

78
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,710
external and internal sites is pretty
much your goals at a hundred percent so

79
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:02,000
when those sites are often accessible
they're being hit all-time whether you

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,139
know it or not or you know hey don't we
can't scan our web servers because this

81
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:13,280
I promise you that your web servers are
getting hit constantly regardless

82
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,679
24 hours of that and as a new
vulnerabilities attacks and exploits are

83
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,360
found so you could maybe see here today
and then tomorrow and exploits publish

84
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,880
that you don't have time to patch your
vulnerable and packers and take

85
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,620
advantage of that so some real quick
statistics

86
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:38,060
again trying to keep this is green folks
as I can some real quick statistics 5126

87
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,220
companies have been the victim of
cyberattacks and that's basically the

88
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:51,610
data from the semantic report 2014 30
websites are approximately every day to

89
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,660
distribute malware only so a lot of
things we're seeing now is that you know

90
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,770
the the days of defacement I mean dbus
always still a problem but let's say

91
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,969
that I can compromise a huge traffic
site like yahoo or or something like

92
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:10,430
that nature I don't I definitely don't
want anyone to know maybe all I'll do is

93
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,289
hide a popup that comes up and
distribute malware from a botnet or

94
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:20,889
something like that so that's a huge you
know those mourning flags are gone right

95
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:25,849
there's a lot of that monitoring 40 we
got hacked because our website's down

96
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:27,710
someone left you've been

97
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,960
thing yet if someone gets access to a
site that has some good material on air

98
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,449
has high traffic or has high visibility
for your business

99
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,570
let's say your banker an insurance
company or something like that health

100
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,750
care you're you're obviously going to
get the malware the time there is going

101
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:52,890
to be able to detect your your customers
it's just another angle second to last

102
00:08:52,890 --> 00:09:00,030
slide here these are some of the DBI are
from the from 2015 2014 in court

103
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:07,390
breeches most of these had a web facet
to it right so I mean we're talking

104
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:12,500
millions and millions of records and
everything that gets affected from from

105
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,940
these data we do have some point of sale
things like that but these are important

106
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,020
to breaches that can be tied in and
that's just one year so it's not I i

107
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,650
dont see it really getting better it's
kinda getting worse so we understand

108
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:31,980
attackers are moving faster defenses are
slowing down

109
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:39,280
techniques are are become streamlined
and a lot of things will receive two is

110
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,040
a lot of smaller and medium-sized
businesses are getting attacked the days

111
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,480
of why would anyone want my stuff I own
a check company is over as we know any

112
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,840
check company may have a large client so
now you're a target

113
00:09:53,890 --> 00:10:02,040
you know we had different kind of
evolution of a tax rate so last year

114
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,579
sixty percent of all targeted tax stuff
small and medium-sized business so the

115
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:13,380
majority of attacks that were documented
last year we're not against your large

116
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:20,800
enterprises thats shift so I think that
that shift is probably for a few

117
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,620
different reasons so being in a
large-scale enterprises a lot of

118
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:29,060
different security in place already not
saying that everything is perfect but

119
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,060
I'm saying that small-medium business
may not have the personnel or the

120
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,630
response teams for the time or the focus
to really put into security

121
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,540
and you know only a small business I
can't say I blame them because they're

122
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,689
trying to keep their business open and
food on the table and that kind of thing

123
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:53,260
but it's a statistic that's worth noting
great so sometimes all of this security

124
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:59,050
that is basically put into these
websites or web application looks really

125
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:05,939
get it has controls has everything in
place so you can't break let's say that

126
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,430
there's two factor authentication
there's automatically locking you out

127
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:19,800
after X amount of hours or minutes you
have to fill in multiple forms prove

128
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,140
you're not a robot do acts do I do see
to be able to authenticate in all that

129
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:33,439
great stuff has a great little green
padlock everything Seyfried intentions

130
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:41,330
may have been good most of the time but
sometimes stuff happens it happens so

131
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:50,890
one quick example that our gifts here is
an online shopping example of sanitize

132
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:57,210
the slide if you recognize this show or
it's up to you but it is what it is

133
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,970
this is something that I found
personally I was buying an item for

134
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:11,290
myself from a large retailer and I went
to look up I wanted to know I didn't get

135
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:17,730
an email confirmation for my order and
usually businesses are pretty good about

136
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:24,640
that second order and you know within an
hour you get in a notification so I I

137
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,300
wanted to look at my order and I didn't
have your number yet

138
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:34,530
so I went to the site and I looked at
what the criteria were looking up in

139
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:38,910
order I didn't have an account so I
didn't sign up to say okay yes create an

140
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:46,620
account for me cause I don't really care
so what I did was I looked and what you

141
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,120
needed three different pieces of
material to be able to get your order

142
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,330
steps forward three or four I have the
slide show you needed your order number

143
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:03,920
which is long string of unique numbers
for you think an order number you need

144
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,250
your zip code

145
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:10,640
your last name and I think it looked
pretty good but it looked it looked like

146
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:19,160
get you need to know what was their
shares the problem that will get into I

147
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,360
did eventually get the email to order
number but when I did so I just type in

148
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,060
the order number and hit go show me
where my stuff is right because this

149
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:34,829
should have shipped already and what I
found was that you needed to fill out

150
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:41,730
all items mandatory field stop you can't
get your orders can get your order

151
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,800
without filling in your order number and
zip code your last name all of this fun

152
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,329
stuff so if you wanted to try to look up
someone else's order be pretty difficult

153
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,550
people did a really good job

154
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,530
the design of the site saying that just
because you have an order number I'm not

155
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:00,670
giving it to you need to know all these
three these three things have to match

156
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,050
the order number has to match the email
address has to match last name the zip

157
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:04,469
code

158
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,290
everything has to match be able to
pre-order I thought it was great

159
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:15,760
however there's always a bypass right so
there's always something there and I i

160
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:25,020
just got curious so what I did was I I
started playing with the mechanisms I I

161
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,210
did this to burp I did a few different
things to kind of look at what was being

162
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:33,330
said and what was being what the
response was and then I tried a little

163
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,390
bit of a manipulation

164
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,180
so the first thing I want to show you
here and I hope

165
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:45,399
that you can see that I hope I blocked
out where this was anyway so I did write

166
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:51,080
you don't know where that is okay okay
great so you needed all of these things

167
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,810
order number now we're not even tell you
how many digits of your number is so if

168
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:00,050
you don't place legitimate order your
order number to be one did you can be 11

169
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:03,979
digits we don't know what you need all
of these things not one not two not

170
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:09,630
three you need all of them to get the
information so real quick I'm gonna show

171
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:15,589
you my order my email and I what I hope
you can see the screen ok here's the

172
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:17,480
order number right

173
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,160
can anybody hear see something wrong
with the order number in my order I i

174
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,339
didnt sanitized this except for the name
this is my email I took my email

175
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:28,209
yourself but this is anyone say anything

176
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:40,029
the date what about the date the deed is
the order number sensually right so look

177
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:41,570
at the day up there

178
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:49,220
November 2nd 2015 November 2nd 2015
right this is just time the order was

179
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,190
placed

180
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:54,330
that's all it was it was the time now
who cares I have an order number now

181
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,770
it's a large site so a lot of people
place a lot of orders but they don't put

182
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:03,410
any unique identifiers it's only a day
that's a day at a time but I still need

183
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:08,790
a last name and address last name and
ZIP code so how am I getting though that

184
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:14,110
you placed an order I might be all the
guests in order a random order number

185
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,790
right

186
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,610
sure I can get a random order to
purchase a large site probably high

187
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:21,390
volume orders but I'm not gonna know
your last name

188
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:27,199
code so it's pretty good I could try
brute force but I'm not gonna brute

189
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,579
force somebody like this because I don't
want to get in trouble maybe so let's

190
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:39,760
say I'm super ethical today which I
usually so this this is my order so I go

191
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,750
in and I put in the order

192
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,550
and I don't feel in anything else and I
had continued and it basically says no

193
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,800
you have to put in your zip code her
last name or something like that

194
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:57,020
oK so that's wonderful I put it in and
this is what I get this is what my free

195
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:04,230
texts all this fun stuff this was my
order this was a Christmas gift so I

196
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:12,449
have this order here now here's what I'd
like you to look at that URL up there

197
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:19,220
take a look at the URL says order number
and zip code equals and last name equals

198
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:28,260
so it's checking all of that right and
it all has to match right do just what

199
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,720
has the guests what the what's the only
thing you need for that to spit back the

200
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,130
data that there is absolutely nothing
done on this site

201
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,550
whatsoever except for an order number
that's it

202
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:47,240
if you have an order number and let's
say that I have a simple script that I

203
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,820
wrote in Mike's super uber programming
skills a python which basically just

204
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:59,370
picks thousands of order numbers at this
what do I get well let's find out

205
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:06,810
everything and I did I got it all so all
I did was change that and I got

206
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:12,679
everybody's order name I got their last
name I got their zip code orders what

207
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,080
can I do with that I didn't go any
further I could've let's think about

208
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,960
what you can do with that now I know
this person's last name I I know where

209
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:28,270
they live I know that I can probably
find out where they are you know I

210
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:33,310
essentially have all this data now this
is something that looks really secure

211
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,800
this is my Mirage this is this is what
we deal with every day and application

212
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:43,490
security these people that develop this
application that wanted that really

213
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:49,440
wanted to be secure they did a real good
job of having multiple things like me he

214
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,010
just let someone entered all this stuff
has to match all this stuff needs to be

215
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:58,000
there we need to prove who you are and
I'm really happy that they did it but

216
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,220
they didn't follow through

217
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,300
did anybody pen test application report
went live new because I will tell you

218
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:10,850
that my daughter could probably find
this on a pen test and my 11 my 10 year

219
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,459
old not the older so this is something
that can probably be found very easily

220
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,240
this it was not tested now

221
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,280
kudos to the company I will say that
when I disclosed this they fix this

222
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,220
within seven days not seven business
days seven days

223
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:31,540
production environment across everything
it was fixed to me that's a win

224
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:38,389
change control a large company fixing
production applications without downtime

225
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:44,510
maintenance windows nothing that I saw
went down they fix this within seven

226
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:51,629
days it was done they said thank you
it's a bug and that was so as I as you

227
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:57,140
mentioned yes just the order number of
it was alright example to

228
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:06,070
email so emails plz meri everyone kind
of takes it for granted but let's think

229
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,770
about one second what you had in your
email box like in all of your folders

230
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:16,120
your emails is their valuable stuff in
there that can basically take anything I

231
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,389
want from you or a bad person yes
there's something in your email box that

232
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:28,140
can compromise you in some way if it's
your primary so it's not exciting but

233
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:36,430
it's definitely personal so another kind
of enigma another mirage of security

234
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:41,680
right so we have been a public health on
the window here but we have a cockroach

235
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:49,630
crawling on so we got now let's not paid
attention here in that it's alright

236
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:57,780
alright so this one very much I I have
friends who were the security team

237
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:04,070
people that I used to work with personal
friends this is something that I said I

238
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:10,250
was going to disclose this is not
anything confidential my good friends at

239
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:16,380
Yahoo tell let's take a look at that URL
and I really have a whole lot of

240
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:22,250
information in there just a reference
looks like some kind of single page

241
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:29,460
reference to an action there's probably
it's just referencing the number and

242
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:35,950
that number probably ties back to the
email nothing nothing good here this is

243
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:42,490
kinda boring but what does it say sorry
has expired to protect your account

244
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:46,690
you'll need to sign in again will I need
to sign in again did log me out you

245
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,169
think they didn't do anything

246
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:59,249
so that kind of let me set up birth in a
proxy mode and I let it sit and let it

247
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:05,289
sit until this popped up and then they
wanted to see what it does and so I saw

248
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:09,059
something interesting there really
didn't do anything except below that box

249
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:16,749
nothing zero just loaded that box and
then what I did was I said ok I know

250
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:24,759
that I can just disregard this message
type just clear that line now white male

251
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:30,230
yahoo.com hit enter and it goes right to
my inbox minor thing they didn't

252
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:37,580
terminate the session when they said
they did not a big deal I also found

253
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:44,289
that during this time period when you
actually clicked sign out when I was

254
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:50,149
actually left burp running I looked and
it never terminated the session after

255
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:56,559
that went back to the home page after
you hit sign out I disclosed Yahoo Yahoo

256
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:05,470
said was that this was limited to just
the being heard the cluster whatever my

257
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:11,779
one account was on and it was fixed in a
new about it and all that fun it was it

258
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:16,499
was fixed pretty quickly how what could
have happened if everybody who signed

259
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:20,090
out of that email account that I don't
know what their it was five accounts

260
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,678
affected or five billion accounts
affected I don't know but what could

261
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,820
have happened if basically you went to
any machine that you've ever check email

262
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,519
just type in mail . yahoo.com hit enter
and got the last person that was up

263
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:40,499
there is little bit of a kind of the
loop your risk there again this is a

264
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:45,399
really good future if someone leaves
something this should automatically sign

265
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:49,399
you out right but you need to terminate
the session and they didn't turn turn

266
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:55,359
didn't turn into session they didn't do
anything and this is was disclosed now

267
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,178
again

268
00:23:56,179 --> 00:24:02,360
and I I use this kind of talk to just
some generalities this was designed to

269
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:10,059
give you protection but it's it's
doesn't do anything and I think that's

270
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:13,990
wrong to do and that's that's one thing
that if your gonna do with web

271
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,830
application security if your gonna go to
all this trouble to do this turn into

272
00:24:18,830 --> 00:25:02,990
session protect your users like they
expect god you're telling me that every

273
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:08,340
user has to clear all their cookies in
cash to make sure that no one can grab

274
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,678
the cookie that they had before so your
point exactly you need to get rid of

275
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:17,009
that I will come back to that because
there's something I want to mention it

276
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:20,759
ended the talk about sea surf but yet we
will get back to that one because

277
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:28,259
there's some cool stuff in there but
will continue on here so as you can see

278
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:32,179
here all I did was type mailed at
yahoo.com hit and your boom right to my

279
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:36,850
inbox nothing was actually terminated 00
random random good right

280
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,580
well that's a whole nother discussion
but

281
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:48,470
example 3 this one is not hatch this one
I will show you what it is I will not

282
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:51,210
tell you how I did it now

283
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,769
one thing I do want to say is I have a
huge amount of respect for this next

284
00:25:54,769 --> 00:26:01,230
company this is a company that I work
with closely there's some really good

285
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:05,480
individuals that work there that
contribute a lot to security in the

286
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,020
community and to everybody

287
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,150
and there's a lot of love hate it's
Google so there's a lot of good people

288
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,020
that are working there that are doing
good things you know this is just

289
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:18,930
something that they decided that they
weren't gonna fix I'm not releasing this

290
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:24,320
yet because I think that there's still a
vector I could use that I wanna make

291
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,639
sure that is not possible because I
think they're gonna end up fixing it but

292
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:36,640
anyway so I don't know what Google
spends to make a security feature you

293
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,740
know let's think about it how many
calories are lines of code or anything

294
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:48,800
that it takes to create one security
feature either in gmail calendar their

295
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,610
absence I don't know what it cost them
thousands hundreds of thousands whatever

296
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:57,199
but they're putting a lot of money into
it and I told them and they basically

297
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,500
said yeah I understand get around our
security that we put in place you don't

298
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,710
really care we're not going to fix it
because I couldn't supply them with a

299
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:14,600
real vector so there is I couldn't
supply them with an attack method that

300
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:22,429
we take advantage and compromise one of
their end users affected that couldn't

301
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:26,080
take their PII at all right there's
there's nothing personal that I can get

302
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,139
from a user with this attack is I don't
have the vector for the method of attack

303
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:37,060
and I'm still working on it and I think
I can figure something out but anyway so

304
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:43,190
this started as anyone here know Johnny
Christmas alright so this this one here

305
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:49,820
started with an IRC chat I was on with
Johnny and I was looking for an old

306
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:54,990
sequel injection program windows-based
sequence action program for probably

307
00:27:54,990 --> 00:28:01,030
like a decade ago and I was doing a this
was part of something that I wanted to

308
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:06,809
show 40 oz it was a big basically a
training for simplified seeker injection

309
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:14,340
and so I asked shine in a bunch of other
people for this particular file and

310
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,658
Johnny said to me I have the file but
it's infected with malware I'm just

311
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:24,210
letting you know if you don't care I'll
give you the file I am gonna spin up at

312
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:28,090
the end for this i really don't care
send me whatever you want so he said try

313
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:34,539
to send it to me I don't do DCC stand so
I didn't do that so he just threw up on

314
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:39,929
Google Drive here it is you want it you
can have it thanks Johnny no problem I

315
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:44,970
went to grab it and it said the file you
are now trying to download is infected

316
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:48,450
you cannot download this file Google did
a good job doesn't let me download a

317
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:54,470
file that in fact with no matter that's
a win right that's good that's good for

318
00:28:54,470 --> 00:29:01,289
everybody but i dont wanna keep bugging
him he was traveling or doing something

319
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:04,789
and you know I thought it was nice to
tease you played with filed herewith so

320
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:08,360
what I did was look for a way to get
around that the only way you can get

321
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,039
around that with Google Drive is if
you're the owner of the file if you are

322
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,559
the owner the person who uploaded or
created that that directory that file

323
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:23,450
you can download the Malheur file they
don't care but only the owner now I said

324
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,460
is this just means is there something
with my Google Drive whatever can I do

325
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:31,149
something to get around that so I did
some research I got an official response

326
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:37,399
from Google and this was that's her
right there on the Google Drive help

327
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:41,998
forum essentially it's false as a false
positive user be clean but about this

328
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:46,110
was not me this is someone else know the
point is that they have a safety measure

329
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:51,498
and this is her from Google thank you
for posting your patience it looks like

330
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:57,460
the file was in fact infected by a virus
to send you information privately only

331
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:02,799
the owner of such file for his personal
use is allowed to to download the file

332
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:08,289
is not allowed to share infected files
here at work school official so now I

333
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:13,480
knew that what I found was going against
what they

334
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:19,619
said was their official I found a way to
bypass that and I was able to download

335
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:26,579
infected file not being the owner fully
bypass this control and I submitted it

336
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:31,109
to security at Google thanks for the
report we feel that this issue poses

337
00:30:31,109 --> 00:30:34,389
very little practical risk so we're not
going to track this one is a security

338
00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:40,319
but I know people that work there so I
got their kind of take on it and they

339
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:45,219
said the only reason that we were saying
this is because yes you defeated one of

340
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:52,549
our controls but your knowingly
downloading an infected file even though

341
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:55,819
you're not the owner great you bypass
the control but you know it's infected

342
00:30:55,819 --> 00:31:02,219
so can you check -user into doing
something show us an attack vector and

343
00:31:02,219 --> 00:31:07,919
once I can give them a viable factor
they're gonna fix it but what I

344
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:15,009
basically said was you know you care
enough to allow the owner of the file to

345
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:18,409
download it's infected I found a way
around security measures that is equal

346
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:22,739
or greater concern it's a legitimate
risk it's above all published in ninety

347
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:30,309
days and they basically said thanks for
the ninety days heads up and I took out

348
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:36,279
what they said next because that's what
I'm working on and you know we bring

349
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:41,409
this up in the Google Drive thing and
I'm like you know what this brings me to

350
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:46,819
my next topic that I like to talk about
for this talk and that's both bands if

351
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:50,499
your gonna run legitimate disclosure and
bug bounty program

352
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:57,209
gotta do it the right way I'm not saying
this is legitimate or not right so all

353
00:31:57,209 --> 00:32:01,019
I'm saying is that they cared enough to
spend money on a security feature i

354
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:06,439
bypass said security feature they said
it's great and can affect any users

355
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:09,969
knowing the users are in another
downloading files even if you bypass our

356
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:14,729
security measure it's one of those
things I have my opinions on it right if

357
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:17,809
you're going to spend the money in the
time to make a security feature and I

358
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:22,709
can get around it fix it I'm sure they
can fix it they still haven't but I'm

359
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:23,510
sure they could

360
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:32,020
and this one I won't disclose yet but I
may be disclosing this one as part of

361
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:37,000
another top depending on how to fix it
or if I can get attacked doctor but it

362
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,830
does still exist so that's another one
where it's another my last kind of

363
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:50,179
enigma Mirage so it's it's this it's
this false sense of security

364
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,530
having this feature doesn't let you
download an infected file and we you

365
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:59,480
know we're Google were great rolling in
to let the owner and download it but I

366
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:05,340
can show you that it's it's it's plain
false I can download and I can bypass

367
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:10,409
your controls you did a lot of good work
and protect your users but I found a way

368
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:11,000
around it

369
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
make sure that people do manual testing

370
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,399
I know

371
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:32,998
an infected file that I don't own that
johnnie Christmas owns that file on his

372
00:33:32,999 --> 00:33:37,539
personal Google Drive he's the owner I
know that i can download it even though

373
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:41,879
it's infected even though I had to do
some trickery to do it because normally

374
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:45,639
when I tried to do it says you're not
the owner its infected but I have not

375
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:49,029
tried that there's a couple other
vectors I was looking spiffy some other

376
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:58,539
stuff and so did anyone ever read the
JavaScript for kids books there's no

377
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:02,899
starch press has a javascript for kids
and in that book I know it's convoluted

378
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:09,679
here we're going off track but I get so
in the in the book is it is a is a

379
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,329
section of having a child learn how to
write a hangman game in Java JavaScript

380
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:24,919
so as part of one of my red team talks I
basically wrote this came from the

381
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:31,529
JavaScript kids book I registered a
domain for five bucks or something that

382
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:36,989
related to hang man online games order
something that put a huge amount of meta

383
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:41,558
tags and the page next DNA typing in
hangman into Google you're getting on

384
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:49,159
that first page and basically spoofed
you know you want to play online games

385
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:54,569
signing to your Gmail and getting to
your online hanging getting gmail

386
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:59,180
credentials etcetera I was using that
same type of methodology of spoofing

387
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:03,669
that page and forwarding right so then
this person never knew that they weren't

388
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:07,049
logging in or anything and they can play
the game but I was using that same type

389
00:35:07,049 --> 00:35:12,538
of thought and saying what if I can make
it not appear infected and trick the

390
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:18,990
user into downloading the file from a
page that appears to be you know that

391
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:23,500
warning that says it's just a warning in
a top that this file is whatever if I

392
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,950
can somehow automate the process to be
able to click the link and then just get

393
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:31,609
the file that's the part that I'm having
trouble with I haven't been able to

394
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:35,170
automate anything now as far as what you
said with replacing the file

395
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:40,619
I have not tried that that's another
good idea I was the only thing I run

396
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:48,130
short of my life is time so you know
that's that's that's one thing that I i

397
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:52,549
would do i would like to try to speak
for autonomy that to be able to download

398
00:35:52,549 --> 00:35:56,569
that file I just haven't been able to do
it I think once I can prove that that's

399
00:35:56,569 --> 00:36:03,369
a real risk that I'll be able to get
that acknowledged fix but you know

400
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:09,299
there's also things you can do I have a
couple ideas but now I have not tried

401
00:36:09,299 --> 00:36:15,589
that but that's another good idea I this
brings me to my next topic here and

402
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:20,700
that's bug mountings I do not have
official license to use critics would

403
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,990
but it's there

404
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:28,799
the good the bad and the ugly I'm gonna
do it reverse order because most of what

405
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:35,540
I believe in bug Downing's as positive
as a lot of positive I have some

406
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:39,690
examples that all show that are not
positive but for the most part I think

407
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:47,400
that they can be positive so don't do
this this is one of my many many

408
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:53,750
examples of my frustrations but let's
just glanced at the slide real quick and

409
00:36:53,750 --> 00:37:03,250
i reported a bug shoe this customer the
customer and I have to block that out

410
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:06,119
but let's look real quick right so
what's the date I sent into that but

411
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:11,359
December 19th I submitted the book how
long do you think that someone should

412
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,970
take to get back to you with the bug
that's legitimate let's let's say the

413
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,839
stick to the sake of argument that this
is a real bug that I could publish out

414
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,740
there if I wanted to now they have a bug
bounty program is being managed this is

415
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,970
a hacker one submission to manage bug
bounty probe were not managed by them

416
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:33,319
but what do you think that what do you
think it normal response should be

417
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:41,900
acknowledge you got social

418
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:48,460
experiment guys I'm friends with Katie
who is a hacker one and I reached out to

419
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:54,580
her and i said i submitted a budget I'm
not getting feedback what's up and she

420
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:59,880
says well this is a program that we only
put it goes through us but we don't have

421
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,380
access to the bug and we don't manage
the programs that I can shoot them email

422
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:10,640
paying them or whatever and I said ok go
ahead and then I just left it so my

423
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:18,759
first acknowledgment came on Thursday
September 16th that's the first

424
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:25,260
acknowledgment I got from that book I
was nice I I'll be a hundred percent I

425
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:39,040
forgot December 19th December 19 the but
I actually submitted to with one site

426
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:49,420
and it's a very large database company
and its not or so I submitted the bug

427
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:56,450
I submitted December I gave Katie crap
about its new console what was that need

428
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:59,450
January 20 Diamant

429
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,490
first acknowledgment it's a duplicate
we're working on it thank you

430
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:13,110
ok well you're already working on its a
duplicate duplicate to win now did I

431
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:20,330
submit this in December as a duplicate
hey we found this this was crap I

432
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:25,569
publicly kind of lambasted them about
this and I mean I got my hands a little

433
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:33,190
bit because it's just you know where I
work and stuff like that but it's not

434
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:37,220
how you do bug bounty program I'm nice
and I'm ethical and I'm not going to

435
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:41,730
drop stuff on the internet but there are
a lot of people who will and if you're

436
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:44,990
gonna run a bug bounty program and not
get back to someone from December to

437
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:48,689
September and there's a legitimate bug
on your website you can consider it

438
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:52,320
published right if it's not myself or or
maybe some of

439
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,760
you that there's a lot of people who are
not going to put up with that as soon as

440
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,760
you open up above banker and you have a
responsibility that responsibility goes

441
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,470
both ways it goes from the researcher to
the company but it also has to be

442
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:10,069
reciprocated back and I'm saying this in
this talk today because you know I think

443
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,470
there's a lot of positives I love
running programs for the most part but

444
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:18,779
things like this give them a bad knee
and this just can't this can't happen so

445
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:27,430
the good I have worked with these three
companies disco ball I O bug crowd and

446
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:32,190
hacker one all have really good people
that work there at all had genuine

447
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:37,220
people want to help you know what
they're doing and have really good genes

448
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:43,450
so really good friends i'd bug crowd
their internal team second to none

449
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:50,200
as far as triage verification there's
kinda things anyone knows Jason haddock

450
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:55,470
surrendered the work that he's done you
know this is really good idea now it

451
00:40:55,470 --> 00:41:00,109
doesn't have to be assisted to bug
powder hacker one who ever it could be a

452
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:06,150
private one that you do your oh but you
have to have the resource that connects

453
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:11,210
I but you have to have the resources so
Apple runs a really good program but

454
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:14,810
they do it themselves but they have
great security team to do it

455
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,600
do you have that kind of time and
resources if you don't you might want to

456
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:29,130
use the managed I managed to type of
service like these but so again this is

457
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,720
just my opinion what i've seen

458
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:38,339
opinions you know what they say about
them but this again this is what I've

459
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:42,320
seen out there for the most part with
both Mannings are positive I think that

460
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,460
they provide bang for the buck and
finding real vulnerabilities that first

461
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,270
example I gave you how long do you think
that would have sat out there with the

462
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:55,630
bug bounty program thirty seconds
fifteen minutes I don't know but there's

463
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:58,940
no way that that would have ever been
out there I didn't do anything

464
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,890
I think that bug bounties pretty much
show the results and they're flexible on

465
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,879
your scope and I think that once you put
that scope out there in the public and

466
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:14,250
say this is the scope for the bug down
stay within it I don't I don't know that

467
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:18,430
there's a whole lot I mean I think
there's enough respect they're both ways

468
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:21,830
that if you're running a bug bounty
program the right way that that's going

469
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:25,970
to be effective you look at companies
like test learn things like that and

470
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:31,720
they just their scopes a star there
anything even affiliated with us go for

471
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:37,740
it but you have other companies that
have kind of fat client type of setup

472
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:42,810
and they're like don't talk chart stuff
you can download a copy of our software

473
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:47,500
or program heated up trying something
that tell us but please don't hit our

474
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,840
web stuff and it really works I i've
seen pretty good results but here's the

475
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,800
main considerations that I mentioned
earlier if your gonna set one up

476
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:03,030
yourself make sure your scope is
properly defined now these things having

477
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:07,570
the staff time and dedication and
communication disclosure processes

478
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:14,720
etcetera back to the researchers is
extremely important with that company

479
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:21,100
did Smith from December the September
soured me pretty bad and you know I i'm

480
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:27,470
not wrong to do anything malicious but
stuff like that is what makes you kind

481
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:32,169
of pop up and gets published against you
and we don't want to do that we wanna

482
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:36,290
try to better security and I think that
bug bounty programs for the most part if

483
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:45,490
you can address these do exactly that
and that's kind of my mean feel a lot of

484
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:53,109
the timing and scope considerations here
are the time it takes to triage those

485
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:56,890
false positives and false negatives if
your gonna do that yourself don't take

486
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:02,020
that for granted to communication with
the researchers has to be king

487
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:06,850
disclosure how are you going to disclose
those vulnerabilities are you gonna say

488
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:11,539
if we find a valid vulnerability where
we're going to disclose it or not to

489
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:15,819
disclose it make that stuff noon to your
researchers and also as part of your

490
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:20,099
program make sure you have the
accessibility in the resources

491
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:25,809
accessibility there is that I had a
friend of mine who wanted to open a bug

492
00:44:25,809 --> 00:44:32,480
bounty program further company in their
company essentially right educational

493
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:40,730
web based software but they Jones has a
externally accessible presents for that

494
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:45,670
software they write they write it as
kind of its own in-house solution with a

495
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:50,099
right it they put it in a server
internally and edu or something and then

496
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:54,630
everybody on campus except accesses that
but it's all internal only nothing

497
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:59,609
phases out that kind of stuff so he was
having trouble setting up that kind of

498
00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:04,869
environment where they do a frequent now
of changes he was having trouble setting

499
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,059
up that environment

500
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:12,140
external resources to be able to hit
they want it like they didn't want a lot

501
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,980
of things public smaller companies and
that kind of stuff so they opted to do

502
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:22,200
put more of their efforts on internal
pen testing rather than the bug bounty

503
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:27,899
program and it was the right call for
them so again I think that's that's what

504
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:33,880
I wanted to mention there so I'm gonna
kind of spin this little the other way

505
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:40,940
and I want to help kind of bring some
some transparency to what can be done

506
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:46,440
and again this is a green talk so I
really want to assist anybody with web

507
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:52,349
application security so one of the
things that I see done too often is that

508
00:45:52,349 --> 00:46:02,980
kind of game developers or dump Uggs are
kinda look at him and say your code

509
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:07,930
socks with the hell is this right so why
why should you be doing that the number

510
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:12,009
one thing we have to look is that you
know we have to work with and chain the

511
00:46:12,009 --> 00:46:15,239
developers developers that I work with
the No teams worked with in the past

512
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:20,730
has been really open in interested and
wanting to know more and more about

513
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:25,160
being secure they don't want to write
bugs in the software they just don't

514
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,899
really know most of them don't know
they're mean jobs to write code get a

515
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:36,220
product out and do their child their job
essentially is to get software in the

516
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:42,470
Tuesday so working with and training
developers is gonna be like the number

517
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:48,180
one thing that I can recommend for layer
application security obviously

518
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:54,250
leveraging the top 10 but to go back to
the developers enabling developers to

519
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:59,539
pick security and hear SDLC processes I
have another talk that I've done info

520
00:46:59,539 --> 00:47:05,839
sack that was essentially how to
integrate security interests TLC's and

521
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:13,109
based not every SDLC process the scene
they're all different but how to bake

522
00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:17,520
that in and what methods have been tried
and what methods and i've seen

523
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:24,250
successful and kind of you know put
security as part of the plan before a

524
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,260
line of code developed have some kind of
discussion

525
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,630
ownership and that kind of thing working
with the developers and let the

526
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:35,760
developers actually look for bugs and
and understand what they're doing as

527
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:42,289
they go instead of six months later
going to them and saying here's a pile

528
00:47:42,289 --> 00:47:45,260
of vulnerabilities in your code fix it

529
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:49,650
that's not the way it's done these guys
right they may not remember what they

530
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:52,880
did six months ago there could have been
a team of people writing it let them

531
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:58,079
kind of test as they go to be able to
find those things and fix them and

532
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,799
improve their code is that as their
learning and that's

533
00:48:09,339 --> 00:48:56,788
yeah absolutely

534
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:05,808
problem is that it's not a one size fits
all I mean it may not fit your business

535
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:10,190
a success I mean you're saying that you
have somebody who's in there for a

536
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,380
one-year contract

537
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:28,390
oh yeah thats

538
00:49:35,050 --> 00:50:55,290
sure

539
00:51:10,950 --> 00:52:03,480
I think it can be I think I have not
seen a lot a lot of that flipping

540
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:08,540
actually happening I'd like to actually
see it more to be able to get some data

541
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:14,450
out of that I think can be effective but
let's go back to the bad lock thing

542
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:21,220
right so there's a Dilbert comic that I
treated out from 1995 that basically

543
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:25,868
said it's it's the boss saying we're
gonna pay you for every bug that you

544
00:52:25,869 --> 00:52:31,849
find and the guys happy runs back to his
Cuban he says encoding the new mini-van

545
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:38,920
right so if it's done right I think it
can't happen but I haven't seen a lot of

546
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,859
data as far as people running the
internal programs but I'd like to see it

547
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:45,839
I think it can be something that worked

548
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:48,839
yeah

549
00:52:50,750 --> 00:53:06,460
Red Team Blue team exercises and large
financial institutions at work so I

550
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:11,350
don't know there was no there were no
real incentives percent i've seen red

551
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:18,060
team in blue team's function in very
large financial institutions your giant

552
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:21,230
World Bank's that kind of battle against
each other

553
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:26,670
i've seen that actually produce positive
results now when we add incentives in

554
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:31,440
there I think it can work I just haven't
really seen a lot of data with that so

555
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:37,960
as time is ticking down here I i real
quick as I mentioned it one size doesn't

556
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,660
fit all you have to find what works for
you obviously the buying your leadership

557
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:47,779
necessary integrating processes train
where we're at work with and involve

558
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:52,290
developers at every stage i've seen that
be completely success

559
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:56,620
the most successful if anyone's ever
listen to a talk by the regime unico

560
00:53:56,620 --> 00:54:03,700
this ok every time you involve a
developer helped developer you're gonna

561
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:08,609
help yourself at the end of the day
depending on what your role report

562
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:13,280
metrics this is huge for this right you
want that buying year after year to

563
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:18,070
continue our programs report metrics if
you suck at something at first let

564
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:21,000
everybody know you did a bad job and how
you're gonna do better and then report

565
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:28,340
that go back to those metrics report
report week rinse repeat

566
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:36,720
leverage off huge supporter real quick
about its the open web application

567
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:42,220
security project obviously a lot of
their projects have to do with web

568
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:45,370
application security it's all open
source it's all free

569
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:48,779
obviously they're paid training at
Sakura saying even those kind of things

570
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:53,770
are but the amount of resources that are
out there I'm gonna watch chapter leader

571
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:56,770
and I really like to leverage them
whenever possible

572
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:01,829
again a hundred and forty projects that
are out there if anyone's ever use that

573
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:06,759
it's a free to a huge amount of support
goes into that but a lot of their

574
00:55:06,759 --> 00:55:14,150
product product projects are about
teaching there about helping protection

575
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:18,049
detection and SDLC is their main focus
for those out of those hundred and forty

576
00:55:18,049 --> 00:55:22,269
project so I know that I'm running out
of time and I and i really like the

577
00:55:22,269 --> 00:55:26,258
discussion that we had never done a
green talk before so I'm really

578
00:55:26,259 --> 00:55:31,150
interested in questions and feedback
usually I'm up here showing me what I

579
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:35,660
did with purple how I did that kind of
stuff I've never done a green talk and I

580
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:40,828
i just want feedback or questions and I
think we got like three minutes or so so

581
00:55:40,829 --> 00:56:31,130
you need them and if someone fails that
first time and you are looking at their

582
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:33,839
information say these are our top 10 web
applications

583
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:38,130
these are our metrics are for those
applications they're horrid ok great

584
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:42,099

how you done and really make the focus

586
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:51,589
of a tabloid good job like this is how
we're moving forward and the metrics are

587
00:56:51,589 --> 00:56:54,589

588
00:56:55,869 --> 00:58:34,589
accepted and it's the Battle of
disclosure you have this battle that's
