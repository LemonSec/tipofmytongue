1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,250
usually you don't wanna be the last
talking today or talk right after lunch

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:08,360
so I appreciate everyone who has showed
up to watch this talk is the last talked

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,549
of the day's action the largest audience
I'd ever given this to outside of my own

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,420
company and I was at RSA a couple of
months ago so very excited to see

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,650
everybody here especially younger people
we have in the audience today is a topic

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,788
that's very near and dear to my heart
I've been making the circuit given this

7
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,070
this talk for a couple months now it's
been pretty well received and actually

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,590
just this week Microsoft dropped a press
announcement which I saw on Slashdot

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,899
they're creating a Minecraft educational
edition which i think really balloting

10
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:40,410
everything that I have this presentation
so so we'll get all that stuff in just a

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,930
moment as the slide says my name is
Jared white on a product security

12
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,620
architect at VMware watch the new
collateral and everything up his own a

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,760
good employee so I have these in the
right PowerPoint templates and and most

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,940
of my day to day is filled with working
with developers I also run our Pinterest

15
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:04,768
teen so we actually break the product
you got jeans for anyone out here and

16
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,000
watch user anyone user watching the
organization one due to do

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,860
ok cool thank you that's cool and you
probably hate it because it's a comply I

18
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,759
mean it's a compliance and security
management tool it's basically the CCS

19
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,780
of mobile phones so everybody hates it

20
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,000
our company been trying to get five star
reviews on the App Store's for years now

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,420
and I'm like give that up that's never
gonna happen so one of the things that

22
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,920
we do where I work is okay this is also
new this first time I've given a

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,470
presentation on an iPad Pro one the
other things that we do in my group is

24
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,620
threat modeling

25
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,180
you work very closely with our
engineering teams in our development

26
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,420
team to assist them in developing their
threat models we also helping poke holes

27
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,250
in their threat models leaves the
Microsoft threat modeling tool Microsoft

28
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,420
modeling program which if any of you
know Adam shostak literally wrote the

29
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,970
book on threat modeling for Microsoft
and said that's the that's the thing

30
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,270
that we use

31
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,160
I haven't talked really at all about
Minecraft yet and some of you are

32
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,289
probably wondering what the heck does
minecraft has to do with security and

33
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:14,959
I'm here to tell you it actually has a
lot to do with security but but mostly

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,990
because I think minecraft is sort of
preparing this generation to be the next

35
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,420
generation of security professional
security engineers risk assessors and

36
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,350
things like that so I'm gonna dive right
into it on long in the tooth anyway and

37
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,350
this is a long conversation actually
usually have a video that will show at

38
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,760
the end too but I always have a problem
with that video I can either not play it

39
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,260
and get sound or I can play it and get
no sound so it's completely worthless I

40
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,120
cut it out of my presentation but if we
have like 20 extra minutes at the end of

41
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,709
something I'll load up the video so here
are some things we talked about today

42
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:47,800
but let's dive right in

43
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,610
so why micro right well there are a lot
of reasons why minecraft Mindcrack

44
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:00,790
teaches people to think in it teaches
people the threat model on the go

45
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,579
it teaches people to work in
three-dimensional space and also have to

46
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,830
secure their possessions in
three-dimensional space attacks can come

47
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,530
from the sides they can come from above
they can come from below their

48
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,910
environmental attacks there are actual
threat agents that are out there to get

49
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,739
you are actively trying to harm you as
it turns out my craft is a really solid

50
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:26,239
simulator for the real world whenever it
comes to threats the other interesting

51
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,440
thing about minecraft is that there are
very real consequence well I shouldn't

52
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,820
say that but there are serious
consequences within the Minecraft world

53
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,430
for bad security just like there are in
the real world right if we're not good

54
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,230
it information security we don't
practice it properly we don't implement

55
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,019
properly and we don't really understand
it we're going to fail at it but

56
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,170
you know one day I was just sitting at
home playing Minecraft and play

57
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,280
minecraft where I don't know how long
since it was an alpha stages

58
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,860
play Minecraft for a long time I've been
doing information security for about 14

59
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:03,930
years so one day I'm sitting at home and
I'm playing Minecraft and I just trying

60
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,530
to secure my valuables from getting
destroyed by these creepers which will

61
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,240
get into and I started thinking man
minecraft is actually a really

62
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,080
interesting way to think about
information security topics and

63
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,630
challenges and so that's what led me to
put together this this presentation and

64
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,110
of course the other reason is mining
that's why minecraft minecraft because

65
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,880
it's fun because we like to mine I
finally got my wife playing Minecraft a

66
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,670
couple years ago before that she just
could not understand the appeal and now

67
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,500
she's just like absolutely obsessed with
it and she thinks that said there

68
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,910
appeared it and really all she doesn't
mind like that's it she just mines and

69
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,860
then builds these days big castles and
stuff which I guess really is the only

70
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:49,710
point of my career so these probably
look pretty familiar to you or anyone

71
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,760
who's an application security is anyone
in application security by the way

72
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,440
anyone involved in modeling doesn't have
to be application threat modeling but

73
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,130
system threat modeling or network
modeling anyone I see someone getting

74
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:06,219
knowledge nobody up there that got
probably is so these these properties

75
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,690
are all probably pretty familiar to most
of us information security professionals

76
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,340
particularly in development and
engineering groups and application

77
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,210
security but they're certainly
applicable outside of those groups as

78
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:21,520
well so these properties are also
properties in concept that are important

79
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,250
in Minecraft security performance and
user experience no user experience will

80
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,360
stretch so bear with me there but these
are all very important concepts within

81
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,870
the world of Minecraft and I've listed a
couple of reasons why these are

82
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,220
important concepts up here we'll explore
these more here in a moment but of

83
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,470
course in security there's a really
important ones right in Minecraft you

84
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,400
have to eat to survive and in order to
eat you either have to hunt for food or

85
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,219
you have to grow

86
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,910
so that's sounds very simple on the
surface

87
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,260
anybody put micro now here's where the
hands go up right like hey who's an

88
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:06,480
InfoSec crickets crickets who like
Minecraft so so you will be familiar

89
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,850
with this you'll know these things I'm
not gonna teach you about Minecraft

90
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:14,040
today although you probably will learn a
lot about my crap you also have to

91
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,460
protect your assets rights you spend
hundreds of hours playing Minecraft and

92
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:25,260
you do what you build big castles and
towers and maybe replicas of spaceships

93
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,690
you gather a lot of diamonds and
valuables you put him in chests in your

94
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,040
house you have things you want to
protect right and there are threats in

95
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,090
the environment that will destroy those
things that you up just like in the real

96
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,010
world and so you have to protect those
assets and that's a big component of the

97
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,719
game and that's actually what you spend
a lot of time in the game doing is

98
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,490
protecting yourself protecting your your
your buildings or structures and her

99
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,020
goodies that you spent hundreds of hours
beneath the earth delving poor

100
00:06:53,020 --> 00:07:01,130
performance so minecraft is an open
world it's a big sandbox minecraft can

101
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,460
be at one point we operated a Minecraft
world that was one of the largest in the

102
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,989
world in the real world was about the
size of the state of Rhode Island which

103
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,960
is very large for an interactive
computer game and and one of the

104
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,680
problems was is that her old was so
large it was really a pain in the butt

105
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,150
trying to get around right so you know I
had to it I had to run a thousand blocks

106
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,419
if I wanted to go hunting for something
because people had already populated the

107
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:31,330
forests around where we had also or I
had to stake out 5000 block somewhere

108
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,909
else and building Newcastle because some
jerk moved in next door and built a

109
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,780
giant statue of himself right I don't
want to live next to that so so it's

110
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,489
important to be able to get around very
quickly and efficiently in Minecraft and

111
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,630
the other thing is that you have to be
able to get around safely and that's a

112
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,159
lot more difficult than it probably
sounds on the surface and then the final

113
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,630
thing here is user experience right if
we're gonna say that minecraft

114
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:00,050
simulator we have to we had to have a
base assumption here that were playing

115
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,789
Minecraft right so we're using minecraft
as a model for something we have to

116
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:08,509
assume that we're playing Minecraft and
this is our user experience required we

117
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:14,500
have to play minecraft we have to enjoy
my crap and what other reason is there

118
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,449
then exploration creativity building
things like that right so we want to be

119
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:24,009
so in our threat model what we're gonna
say is one of our requirements is that

120
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:28,030
you also want to just live in a
Minecraft world playing Minecraft world

121
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,710
and play the game Minecraft otherwise
what's the point of this conversation

122
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,390
and you know again

123
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,838
exploration creativity just just going
in and playing with redstone circuitry

124
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,560
if anyone's again those minecraft
redstone circuitry is really cool it's

125
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,670
one of the cornerstones of Microsoft's
focusing on in the in their educational

126
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,449
stuff actually teaches kids programming
which is like super cool I wish there

127
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,149
was a computer game that were around
when I was a kid we would have taught me

128
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:57,160
computer program but there wasn't so
let's talk about the first requirement

129
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:03,459
security and so this is my totally
superfluous amount of diamonds it's not

130
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,529
real I made it for this presentation
because I would never have that many

131
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:10,779
diamonds stacked up especially on the
outside world like where there's no

132
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:16,350
protection for it right so not secure
this is not secure but these are some of

133
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,399
the assets that you're interested in
securing right sweet sweet done and

134
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:27,010
those of you know how you down to the
world right you're mining mining mining

135
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:32,740
and all of a sudden you see this little
blue glint there's little green diamonds

136
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,500
right that's why you play minecraft is
no there's no point in Minecraft you'll

137
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:42,519
get diamonds so the other thing that's
really important about minecraft is for

138
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:47,310
your personal possessions your tools
your property your livestock in this

139
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:53,739
case you're far as your steals all of
your accuracy or animal husbandry all of

140
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,920
this tougher things that you want to
protect in the early iterations of

141
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,349
Minecraft these things would actually be
trampled

142
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,370
ruined by bad guys in the environment so
one of the things to say but he might

143
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,080
build this farm easier for me to reach
over here but I am I built this farm he

144
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,820
has no fence around it that would not
have been how I would have designed a

145
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,200
bar but he started playing later in the
Minecraft stages where animals wouldn't

146
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,410
just roam across your food trample in
destroy it happening now is really

147
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:24,420
frustrating we started putting fences
around our around our bar that's a

148
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,949
that's threat modeling right at the end
of the day that's threat modeling I

149
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,390
haven't asked that I'm trying to protect
and here's the threat to it and so i'm

150
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:36,300
taking a mitigation step in order to
protect that asset it's a simple as

151
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,670
putting a fence around your for now
obviously you put fences around your

152
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,290
livestock because they wander off and
disappeared you don't put a fence around

153
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,670
them so they're really captured
prisoners but we tried to be well there

154
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,490
there crammed in there pretty hardcore
but don't just ignore that its cool

155
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,860
there there there really well cared for
and and and when we feed them all to us

156
00:10:53,860 --> 00:11:01,200
are sure will go in that because it
seems much more compassionate so yes

157
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,050
their program to like it and then of
course we have chest down here so you

158
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:10,020
have you have seeds the used to plant
food and also the food that you harvest

159
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,760
you throw into the chest and if you want
to protect the stuff as well this stuff

160
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,410
can be stolen it can be destroyed

161
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,020
now one thing to keep in mind is that
today we talked about Minecraft modeling

162
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:24,010
what we're really protecting against our
environmental threats we're not talking

163
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,700
about other humans ok griefers are a
whole nother thing entirely and there's

164
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,660
really not a whole lot you can do to
protect yourself and then except not

165
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,209
allow on your server to begin with
that's why I whitelist my server and I

166
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,980
know at the end of this presentation I
will get at least one person who says

167
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,610
can I come and play on your server the
answer is no I bet you're all very cool

168
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,290
people but I don't know any of you well
enough to let you on my server or even

169
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:51,120
give you the hosting so another thing
that you want to make sure you secure

170
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,260
are your dwelling areas right and then
your your your transportation mechanisms

171
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,270
I tend to like to just build

172
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:06,730
being egomaniacal castles made of sand
off the list in the onyx and granite and

173
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:12,550
then I'll build like a big discount
opposite sort of Gloria me right so I

174
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,250
like building stuff like that I
generally bilbies big castles and things

175
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,900
like that they don't serve a practical
purpose for the most part but but

176
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,650
definitely how you design your castle
then we'll dig into this one here in a

177
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:29,939
moment a little bit later but how you
design your dwellings and how you design

178
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,050
your work spaces are very important
things will talk about his perimeter

179
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:38,699
defenses perimeter defenses are
extremely important in Minecraft just

180
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:44,070
like they are in the real world we're
talking about network security so if we

181
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,580
move onto performance again we talk a
little bit about efficient

182
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:52,470
transportation bill see here this is a
rail system and where it's coming out of

183
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,350
his actually a rail station and one of
the things that you want to make sure

184
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,910
you do is you keep monsters out of your
transport systems you keep markers off

185
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,839
your Rails you actually you know martyrs
will wander up on these tracks will be

186
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,320
careening down at sixty miles an hour
and then you hit a creeper straight up

187
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,690
in the face and they explode

188
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,030
not only did they kill you and all your
stuff but they also destroy your

189
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,709
tracking and you're in your rail and
things he spent a lot of time working

190
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,230
and that's pretty miserable but you want
to make sure that you keep all of the

191
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,870
things that you need sort of around in a
safe area that you can travel between

192
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:28,670
without having to worry about being
genuinely attack and of course you want

193
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,849
to be efficient you want to find the
most efficient ways travel I believe the

194
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,620
most efficient way to travel in
Minecraft today and I apologize I'm

195
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,280
actually working on this presentation
kinda cook took the gust 0 out of me to

196
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,000
play Minecraft for a little while so 1.9
has come out in the last couple of

197
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,190
months which I still have not even
played because I just cannot play

198
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,980
minecraft right now because I've been
talking about it so much but I think the

199
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,820
most efficient mode of transportation is
still the horse just seems wrong to say

200
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,440
but I think the horses the best mode of
transportation followed closely by the

201
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,660
rail system the rail system is my
preferred method of playing so here's

202
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,920
one of my egregious cities that I
actually took me

203
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,459
I don't know a year to put together but
but to me permanency is one of those

204
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:18,199
great experiences about Minecraft
putting its stake in the ground in the

205
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,079
building something up around it that's
what I get out of my crap that's what I

206
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,339
like about Minecraft but I also need to
be in some sort of danger which is why I

207
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:30,910
play survival mode not creative mode I
can just sit dilday if I wanted to play

208
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,639
creative mood but I like the danger I
like the aspect of having to secure my

209
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,720
stuff for people so you'll see here and
win some great lengths to secure my

210
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,430
supper people I've got a fence here and
I've got another big wall that a castle

211
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,359
in a big way around and that has
actually has another little wall it's

212
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,920
like a big wall it's a layered approach
right now

213
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,519
layered approach to this is nothing new
but these are all things that that you

214
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,360
guys are probably familiar with already

215
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,519
exploration you want to be able to
explore in order to explore you gotta be

216
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,709
able to survive in order to survive and
got to be able to eat and you gotta be

217
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:08,349
well-equipped and in order to be able to
eat and be well equipped you gotta do

218
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,100
all of these other things that we were
just talking about you gotta far you've

219
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,160
got a raise animals gotta build tools
and you have mine in order to build

220
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,819
tools such as short a hole in ecosystem
but exploration is really no fun if you

221
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,750
constantly are dying or you constantly
get you know a couple thousand blocks

222
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,660
away and it starts raining and you can
see the Sun anymore and now you're

223
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,790
totally lost and so you end up dying in
the wilderness happen anymore the one

224
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:35,599
time of course exploring on the ground
this is always a little scary for me

225
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,420
minecraft is like half like to me on any
play half life back in the day when I

226
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:44,620
was in high school like half a man like
I would actually turn out the lights and

227
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,130
played in the dark with the sound turned
all the way up as I like that aspect of

228
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:48,560
it

229
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,630
minecraft is the same way man when
you're down below the earth and there's

230
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,649
mobsters groaning in like moaning and
stop in there like they could be 1

231
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:59,140
blocked on the other side of the wall
from you you know where they are but you

232
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:04,209
can hear oh and that really freaks you
out so all of these things are things

233
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:08,649
that people enjoy about Minecraft so
there's no point in playing this if you

234
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:11,329
are gonna if you are gonna incorporate
these things into

235
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:14,769
so here are some things about our
environment for those of you who don't

236
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:17,319
play minecraft these may come as a shock
to you

237
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:21,248
monsters are a threat to your survival
of course no monsters in the real world

238
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:27,129
except during election season but but
monsters are a real threat for us in

239
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:31,439
Minecraft we also have a lot of
environmental threats probably not one

240
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:35,529
that we deal with much here in the
southeast but lava is a is a threat

241
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:39,809
that's very prescient in the Minecraft
world of course falling to your death

242
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:43,259
now this is probably one that does
happen a lot in the real world but it is

243
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:46,449
also a concern in the Minecraft world
because falling from a great height is

244
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:47,819
bad no matter how you slice it

245
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:53,420
starving again something that really
sadly happens here as well getting loss

246
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:59,540
man I you know I guess short has anyone
ever read the story the Death Valley

247
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:04,809
germans really fascinating by the way if
you're interested in these sort of like

248
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:08,908
lost people stories it's a group of
germans who were touring in the united

249
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:12,480
states they drove out into Death Valley
Valley they took one wrong turn and it

250
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,260
basically ended up in in in their demise
so getting lost in Minecraft can

251
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:22,189
actually kind of work the same way is if
you if you go far from home you don't

252
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:26,720
have read landmarks that you can
navigate with you can use the Sun the

253
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,470
Sun is actually a very effective way in
Minecraft

254
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:34,799
as it is in the real world to navigate
but the problem is when it rains it

255
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,139
actually obscures the Sun and everything
becomes like really hazy and so then

256
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:41,830
you're far away from home you don't
recognize anything you're running low on

257
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,279
food your swords about to wear out now
it's raining you have no idea which way

258
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:49,279
you can you took one wrong turn and now
you're totally disoriented and then you

259
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:54,169
generally . so getting lost is totally
legitimate concern in Minecraft and it

260
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:59,130
will it will sometimes resulting debt
other players again I said we were going

261
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,059
to include that in the threat model
today but other players are certainly a

262
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:08,210
way that you can die and my favorite
humorous which generally involves me

263
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,370
just mining mining mining mining mining
mining mining mining mining and then i

264
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,580
don't realize there's a lot of block
here and I remove that one and I just

265
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,418
step straight into it and fall straight
to the floor into the ending in the

266
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,460
lobby another great story but humorous I
had a friend who decided he wanted to

267
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,389
come play minecraft

268
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:29,339
he built a house he chose to build his
house over like I don't like over a big

269
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:32,139
pool of lava but he didn't realize it
was down below

270
00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:36,079
again he was really bad at perimeter
security so one night a creeper followed

271
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:39,678
him into his house he was digging around
in a chest creeper blew up he fell to

272
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,129
the floor in a lot along with all the
stuff in the chest lost everything rage

273
00:18:43,129 --> 00:18:49,269
quit didn't see that dude so here is
another way that that it will get you so

274
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:52,619
what I want to do now is talk about some
of the threat agents that we have in my

275
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:55,539
credibility will be familiar with these
at least this when you see it on

276
00:18:55,539 --> 00:19:00,279
t-shirts and they'll know the name of
this one it is reproduced put it up

277
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:04,729
there you did you are you sure ok I did
put that I did put the name of their

278
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:11,059
though ok so I've attempted to get some
properties of these well let me with a

279
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:15,259
real-world Brett Cooper is a
denial-of-service creepers are terrible

280
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:20,049
there like the worst and I mean that
literally creepers are the works like

281
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:24,559
worse than those other people that
people generally name when talking about

282
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,570
who the worst is they will sneak up
behind you there very quietly VDD sneaky

283
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,149
they will sneak up behind you and when
you least expect it they will explode

284
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:37,049
taking with them creepers are also one
of the few mobs in the game that will

285
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:42,469
actually destroy your loot so that sucks
what really sucks getting tag teamed by

286
00:19:42,469 --> 00:19:46,649
a pair of creepers first one comes in
blows you up all of your stuff falls on

287
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:50,678
the ground and around the same time that
second one is exploding and he catches

288
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:53,979
you just in time to get all of your loot
laying on the ground and explodes that

289
00:19:53,979 --> 00:19:58,179
stuff to do that so rage quit moment for
me I generally leave and don't come back

290
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:05,259
now all monsters in Minecraft haven't
had a remote access property they can

291
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:09,309
spawn anywhere where the light level is
is is too dark

292
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,869
we'll talk more about that in a min I
wanna spend a whole lot of time on that

293
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:17,299
now but triggers just short lace up
their terrible and able to stop the

294
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,299
structure that houses the globe your
your loot

295
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:26,610
and next we have skeletons skeletons are
interesting I think of skeletons kind of

296
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:31,250
his remote code execution race condition
is a little bit of a stretch but they do

297
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:38,659
she even faster the closer it gets but
remote code execution these are ranged

298
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:42,240
attackers right so they can stand on the
other side of a chasm and shoot you

299
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,370
across the castle and actually they're
really nasty 19 from what I understand

300
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,049
and like everything else

301
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:53,149
skeletons will spawn in dark areas where
there's not enough light and as you can

302
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:56,658
see this one has taken to standing under
a tree because they do burn in the

303
00:20:56,659 --> 00:21:01,029
sunlight has taken a standing under a
tree to shoot me like they will

304
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:03,940
literally just and under a tree where
they're not being touched by sunlight

305
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,289
issue it's the most frustrating thing
ever

306
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:09,700
they can also shoot you over fences they
can shoot you over walls walls aren't

307
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,139
high enough again pretty frustrating
especially if you get a couple of them

308
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:23,559
together in a group next we have a typo
but also next we had was on bees what

309
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:29,769
it's been medically the same connection
has gone be used on these are our buffer

310
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:34,289
overflows their viruses they did get you
in numbers right to get you with just

311
00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:40,110
just just well maybe brute force would
have been better so so so generally they

312
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:45,260
mob you write dying from a mob of
zombies is really unpleasant especially

313
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,889
when a baby when get you man I hate that
that's insulting but also what's on

314
00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:53,830
these can do is they can bite villagers
in the game and turn those villagers in

315
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:58,340
design be so they multiply their numbers
by biting people it's a novel thing that

316
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,799
zombies the apparently but anyway these
are frustrating again they did they're

317
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,750
mostly just become a true numbers and
you mostly find them underground you'll

318
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,600
be in a tunnel somewhere and you're kind
of trapped hard to get away in these

319
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,299
things and I also understand these are a
lot harder on 19 now be at the time your

320
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:18,929
strikes with your sword to make him hit
you can't just like spam your sore right

321
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:21,120
to play 19 yeah you gotta like

322
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,739
much more much more careful now whenever
you quite so these can really do some

323
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,540
damage it's generally just easier to run
away from these guys and then finally we

324
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:36,550
have the spider man I hate spiders for a
couple reasons these particular spiders

325
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:44,430
arcade spiders they live in case and
they poison you so that that's a poison

326
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:49,080
you and they jump in your face and on
your face and they they they build these

327
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,570
cobwebs which stick you up so you could
be running in the running to a cobweb

328
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:57,120
your stock and spiders on your face your
face and and they're really fast and

329
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,520
just carrying awful I hate spiders and
then there's a breed of spiders also

330
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,510
live above ground to say nothing of the
deal with spiders when you're below the

331
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:07,290
world working out a deal with whatever
you're above ground to really

332
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,580
frustrating but on spiders are
everywhere and the reason I have back

333
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,460
door there is because spiders can
actually climb walls and up walls and

334
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,200
pub structures right so one of the one
of the first threat model that I came to

335
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,110
realize is building a lips on wall right
so you've got a vertical wall and a

336
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:29,240
spider will climb right up that thing so
one thing that I do some people bill

337
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,890
glass walls to spiders on climbing rasa
hate that it's tacky I'm very

338
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:38,559
aesthetically picky in Minecraft I only
smooth granite I think they have nice

339
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,750
beautiful qualities which make them
suitable for building mansions and

340
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:46,300
things like that anyway I digress but
but but what were the first thing I

341
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,520
realized is you build this vertical wall
spiders will totally just climb right

342
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,230
over it so what do you put a lid on it I
look at this so you just put a lid on it

343
00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:00,740
like that right and now a spider climb
up here but he can't go out and over

344
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:06,450
this lip so again spiders pain in the
butt but generally you can manage to get

345
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,030
away from it except the case fighters
which which are just terrible ok so now

346
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,928
let's get into what we have to work with
here in my craft what do we have to work

347
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:18,210
with to secure our stuff and to execute
on our threat model

348
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:22,110
well we have blocks that's pretty much
it in Minecraft everything

349
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:26,750
so we have blocks that are green water
blue boxer strong blocks that are very

350
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,750
small blocks that are very resilient to
attack an explosion blocks are not very

351
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:37,440
resilient to attack an explosion and and
some blocks as I say here make better

352
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,620
building materials and others I happen
to be a fan of stone obsidian is the

353
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:45,469
strongest block in the game but it's
it's extremely difficult to mine and

354
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:50,530
actually think I have a lot of this is I
don't why this is here shooting the

355
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:55,830
overall but here's what I wanted to show
you this is this is not an exhaustive

356
00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:00,178
list of all the blocks in the game was a
very small list of all about the game

357
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:06,690
but they are more or less organized by
their resistance to explosion so far and

358
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:10,929
he had dirt and sand terrible if anyone
remembers the the old wise man built his

359
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:14,510
house upon us and write this the
terrible terrible thing to build out of

360
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:20,500
you don't use dirt sand gravel and even
would can be a little terrifying quick

361
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,299
aside years ago when I first started
playing Minecraft I spent probably a day

362
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:30,030
or two building this giant wooden villa
now I know about you guys but I have

363
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:34,178
multiple homes in Minecraft just like
someday I will have in real life and so

364
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:38,880
I wanted to build a big beautiful
beachside villa so what did i do I built

365
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,720
a big beautiful beachside villa and I
selected only the finest wood to build

366
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,750
this village out of a beautiful birds
that grew right in my little area there

367
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,350
so I built this you know where I'm going
this alright don't spoil the story

368
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:57,149
because this is a good one so I built
this entire villa out of wood and then I

369
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:03,510
thought I'm sitting in my villa sipping
a mai Philip and I'm thinking you know

370
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,809
the one thing that would make this
experience better you know the one thing

371
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:08,100
that would make us feel better

372
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:13,139
a fireplace so I built a fire place now
listen I'm not stupid I built a fire

373
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:18,160
place out of stone ok and I talked about
the stone fireplace what I neglected to

374
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,860
notice was that there was one tiny block
where I had not properly walled off the

375
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:30,340
the the house from from the fire pit so
I like the fire and I step back

376
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,320
back and all of a sudden I noticed the
whole thing is catching on and my wife

377
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,470
happens to be sort of walking behind me
at the time and you normally she doesn't

378
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,669
care what's going on she kind of looks
and does a double take and she sees that

379
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:44,370
my pride and joy is burning to the
ground and of course then she spends a

380
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,729
couple of minutes laughing at me and she
actually always makes me tell this story

381
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:52,409
whenever I do this because she thinks so
hilarious I don't know why you think

382
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:55,909
your significant other significant
others things burning down be so

383
00:26:55,909 --> 00:27:01,299
hilarious but apparently to some people
they are anyway I built a new villa a

384
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:08,260
stone so now but at any rate you want to
choose good building materials whenever

385
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,510
you're building your structure is
whenever you're building your roads and

386
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:14,390
an email whenever you're building your
tools right tools have varying degrees

387
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:18,929
of resiliency and so you want to use
good materials whenever you build tools

388
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:23,480
as well now the other quick point here
is that these all have various degrees

389
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,850
of difficulty to harness on the far end
here we have the strongest material in

390
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:31,629
the game at least I think its strongest
material again but man is it a pain in

391
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:35,210
the butt to harvest you can't even
harvest it without a diamond pic so you

392
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,279
have to have the most advanced tool
again

393
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,630
harvest it and you gotta work your way
up to getting that most advanced tool

394
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:44,909
again I also really like stone brick
which they introduced in like one that's

395
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:51,940
it but it's a great guy great so now we
know what all we have to work with so

396
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,730
now we do a little audience engagement
I'll show you a picture and you threat

397
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:59,549
modeling and those of you who play
minecraft

398
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:05,970
your horses in case you're all expert
remodelers I know that ok you have

399
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:13,649
anything to prove today so this looks
kind of Idlib iid licking and quite cute

400
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:18,310
little house you but you know sitting on
a plane we've got some

401
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:23,470
in the background and little she there
and stuff but what's what's wrong with

402
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,170
this picture

403
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:29,200
it does have a wooden door he said that
that's a thing that only my crap player

404
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,180
would know ok well it does have a wooden
door and that is a problem because

405
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:38,830
zombies can kick down wooden doors you
know that what's that you know the glass

406
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:42,090
windows are actually more benefit to me
because it allows me to see what's

407
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:49,120
outside my house waiting to jump on my
face what's that like Raptors yes

408
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,489
they're just all over my crap man if
they put rappers in Minecraft

409
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:59,870
entertainment one of those and using it
as my horse ok so so now let's open it I

410
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:05,550
mean what what's wrong with this it is
made out of town and that just makes it

411
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:09,629
look crappy but yeah you're right it is
it is made out of there I heard someone

412
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:15,070
say there's no lights yeah man no lights
boy that is a death trap so let's look

413
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:19,750
at this place after sunset so I kinda
ruined it so there's another thing

414
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:24,300
there's a couple other things going on
here to order these life

415
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,530
animation the couple of things going on
here to write we got no barrier we got

416
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:33,379
no perimeter right mobsters can just
walk out of this I don't know maybe this

417
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,410
is the various black Forester something
you just like walk out of here and

418
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:40,810
straight up to your door that's
terrifying and then of course we we did

419
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,929
we haven't done anything to the top of
the house monsters can spawn anywhere

420
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:47,530
anywhere just about there certain blocks
against Baltimore but again those blocks

421
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:51,470
heartbreaker building I don't like half
slabs before someone like just left I

422
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:56,720
don't like a slap they looked alright so
anyway the couple things wrong here now

423
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,440
with a look at nighttime man now they're
starting to pile up and what you can

424
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,940
even see is the back of the house and
you look at the back of the house

425
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,160
managed just like skeletons all the way
down and and essentially what happens is

426
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,980
they just encircle your your place and
you you can't get out now you know you

427
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,780
can build another exit and turn allowed
all that kind of stuff to do that every

428
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,480
time the better thing to do would be
built

429
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,850
appropriate perimeter so we can do
better than this fighters will spawn on

430
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:26,189
the top of your house and then just get
up for act right in the face as soon as

431
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:31,559
you walk out the door it's really
frustrating not a raptor be closed so we

432
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:34,049
can do better than this we can do a
little bit better we've already

433
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:37,510
identified a couple of ways in which we
can do better this is better right

434
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:47,650
why the grounds why isn't this better ok
yeah it's would that's that's already

435
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:50,650
told you my experience so that's garbage

436
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,490
what else what else is wrong here we
still have not left the place that's

437
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:08,080
true it's just a matter of preference
then I suppose you up and we got there

438
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,129
ok so this is what nighttime looks like
yard full of creepers yard full of

439
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,880
skeletons and what you can't see on the
other side of the photos there's a

440
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,160
couple of endearment floating around
there that's the other thing we only

441
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:25,799
talk about a couple of monsters that are
horrible they they sound horrible

442
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:31,460
horrible and and they terrify my wife
said in that regard but but anyway

443
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:40,658
so so I I can see why you might think
that the correct thing to do here is

444
00:31:40,659 --> 00:31:45,519
actually to add like so it's ok to have
a big gap between your perimeter but you

445
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,480
do have to use a layered approach right
which I feel so dirty every time I say

446
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,220
that I'm so sorry for saying that i
think is an industry were trying to move

447
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:57,539
away from this is a good player but
anyway so this is a mass and then now

448
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:00,539
this is much better right

449
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:08,169
ok wow we do have a dark spot on earth
and every audience have done this for

450
00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:11,749
has pointed that out I did not intend to
do that this is supposed to be a good

451
00:32:11,749 --> 00:32:15,830
model of how things look but you're all
experts modelers so you got that right

452
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:22,110
off the bat so badly right there we do
still have an attack vector here on the

453
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:34,229
route but we have at least let our yard
we've added a fit that again but ok well

454
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:38,139
I suppose if you hate money that's
that's if you're Daffy Duck Dunn that's

455
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:44,039
definitely wrong that is just a problem
with me that has nothing to do with my

456
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:51,669
crap yes who was at the said that yet
there's what's it again

457
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:57,480
yes the mountain upper oh man I'm it
turns out I'm just as likely either way

458
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,649
yes so that is absolutely right so
you've built this schoolhouse you added

459
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:09,080
a fish you added like you got some
weapons but you forgot there was an

460
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,970
overhang so this is actually my wife
who's about to get eaten by zombies but

461
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:20,369
but you know so you let all of this area
down here you did great here but there's

462
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:23,629
a mountain up here and there is no light
up here now if it were me I would let

463
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:27,279
that whole mountain up I generally build
these big torches like the condor uses

464
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,139
to let them know any enemies coming
exactly totally reasonable so I would

465
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:34,070
just go to the top of the mountain build
a big torch but not everybody thinks

466
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:40,529
like me so I can forgive that but this
total buffoonery right musters will walk

467
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:43,419
down here though Walker right over your
sweet little fans and now they're in

468
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:47,440
their yard in your yard in your brain so
this is a total oversight but I can't

469
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,899
tell you how often little stuff like
this happens in Minecraft and happens in

470
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:57,389
the real world to its even worse in the
real world where a simple misuse of a

471
00:33:57,389 --> 00:34:02,459
function can open you up to something
like this or implementing crypto in a in

472
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,220
a really bad way even though crypto is
mathematically sound we all believe in

473
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:11,000
principle we can still implemented in a
way that sucks and makes it totally

474
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:18,750
susceptible to attack so yes good to
ever spotted now you you actually get a

475
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:28,839
prize I forgot I had prizes today that's
good I hope you own an iMac because I

476
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:33,109
made these DEFCON iMac shades of my 3d
printer and actually meant to bring more

477
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:36,540
some sorry to have more to get out the
rest of the class but he he caught the

478
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:43,739
gaping security vulnerability there so
he gets the ball back yet again images

479
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:48,739
that's that's my bad I should take those
out so here's an interesting this is

480
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:53,178
really cool disappeared one day on my
server this is actually a reproduction

481
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:55,710
of a famous tutor castle in England with
the law

482
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,720
everything as you know around that time
period they're very well known for

483
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,669
building lobby moats around the castle's
so this is an accurate reproduction of a

484
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:10,160
13th century castle so but what's really
cool about this a couple of interesting

485
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,899
things about this it's a really good
representation of a layered approach and

486
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,440
kind of an interesting perimeter on the
only thing that's not greatest sort of

487
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,440
the immediate perimeter outside of the
water but you have this layered approach

488
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,130
the doctors castle it's pretty tall you
got one layer of water around it so you

489
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:30,520
gotta know you did poke a hole in your
firewall there at the very top so that

490
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,930
you can walk across it and actually
monsters will swim across water anyway

491
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:37,660
but it does slowing down a little bit
gives an opportunity to killer now the

492
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,569
other thing that you got it you got
robbed around here so a lot of serbs an

493
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:45,920
interesting purpose aside from being a
fantastic tool it gives off light so it

494
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,920
serves both to deter monsters responding
in your area

495
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,710
also burn them very much if they step
into it so again they could get across

496
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:58,490
the water but then a spider for example
could not reverse that while the moat

497
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:03,189
and climb up the wall and get on the
roof there so kind of an interesting an

498
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,190
interesting look again I don't know who
built this

499
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:54,140
that's it ok so another interesting
thing that we haven't talked about yet

500
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,339
but lighting lighting makes an excellent
perimeter in fact you have to learn to

501
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:02,900
use lighting effectively in Minecraft
lighting is the only way that you can

502
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,260
secure the inside of your dwellings you
can build a house and if you don't write

503
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,330
the inside of that house monsters will
spawn in it and they will explode or

504
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:16,840
they will eat your brains so so you have
to learn to use lighting very early on

505
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,670
and so this is actually a map of the
server that I currently run this is just

506
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:25,910
a small subsection of it there's the log
house that we were just looking at and

507
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:31,450
this is my place this giant inauspicious
tower here and then here's another one

508
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:34,970
this guy tried to outdo me but I don't
really care about that our also is

509
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:39,950
lighting terrible look at that look at
my beautiful greeting every five blocks

510
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:46,919
we place a torch zoom in on this
beautiful that is it's perfectly it's

511
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,720
perfectly wet monsters will not spawn in
here now of course as you get a little

512
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,660
farther and farther out marchers will
start spawning there and they can walk

513
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,259
into these areas but by then the guards
on the top of the tower to take them all

514
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:05,620
out right so this this is actually
something I'm sure every I'm sure lots

515
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,560
of other people figured this out of my
crap this is not something that was

516
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,130
unique to our server or my group of
friends everybody figures this out but

517
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:16,130
eventually a guy named Adrian on my
server figured out that

518
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:22,260
five blocks with the perfect amount of
white and so that's what we use and his

519
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,190
place but don't have this place but
that's ok it's up in the upper

520
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:29,830
right-hand corner and you can see how
well it is places just look i mean you

521
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,640
can tell the difference right here

522
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,819
here these are both super well written
and then you just have one you can see

523
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,650
the railroad tracks you got a light-rail
retract we'll talk about that in a

524
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:43,010
moment as well but again these places
just looks so much more beautiful than

525
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:46,010
all of these other places probably just
because a lighting

526
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:51,460
alright so here is the city of Gilead
shamelessly ripped off from Stephen

527
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,420
King's Dark Tower series I wanted to
recreate the kingdom of Gilead so that's

528
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,340
what I set out to do we got a boundary
over here the castle nobody lives in the

529
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,710
Catholic me that my castle nobody can
look at me and in fact all of my stuff

530
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:06,730
is down several stores several floors in
the castle I don't put any my goodies up

531
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:09,980
on the ground level so that people can
wander into moscow water and actually

532
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,500
put all my good stuff in the basement
but as you can see I have taken a really

533
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,330
crazy layered approach you I have
created an exterior fence a wooden fence

534
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:23,000
that of course spiders can call climb
over and skeletons can shoot over but

535
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,080
then I built a giant nether brick wall
with a lip so that spiders cannot be all

536
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,700
over it

537
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,939
what you can't see is the front gates
which are very grand and beautiful in a

538
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,750
different in marble and all that stuff
anyway and so then you've got the city

539
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,150
so so now we've got a perimeter keep
things out of the city when we got the

540
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,000
city itself in a way that the castle in
the middle of the city again

541
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:50,760
wall wall wall a little over the top but
you know that's how I roll so again this

542
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,060
is just another idea of using blocks and
lighting as a perimeter to push enemies

543
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,590
farther and farther back that's
essentially what you're doing you're

544
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:01,840
expanding your boundary your perimeter
you're pushing the bad guys

545
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,320
farther and farther back I can run
around this city all night and there are

546
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,810
no monsters there are no monsters this
phone anywhere in the city and it is it

547
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:14,460
it's it's a it's a it's interactive
process to go through and identify the

548
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,070
areas where you have low lighting and
add lighting to make sure that they're

549
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:21,900
well lit best thing to do much like
security in the STL make sure security

550
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,900
is an emergent property of what your
building

551
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:36,210
okay now let's look at storage tryna
dispatcher yes terrifying basically you

552
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:43,370
never want a creeper that close to your
stuff so what do we do well yes we do

553
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:47,220
want to kill the creeper that's true but
but what if he's like so close to our

554
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:52,839
stuff we're afraid to attack him because
he might blow ok many answer for

555
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,840
everything alright cool

556
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,190
yes you're right that's what you would
normally do but take a little bit of a

557
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:00,190
different approach I don't have any
weapons right I don't have any weapons

558
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:06,110
on so what am I gonna do to build a
house now put my stuff in my house that

559
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:10,340
makes perfect sense I have taken all my
valuables I put them in a chest and then

560
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:14,730
I put it inside of the house anyone see
anything wrong with this picture

561
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:24,260
well it is a way to come on guys let let
me let that one go please my wife won't

562
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:30,330
let me live it down now you won't let me
live it down yes generally that would

563
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:33,680
not be a good idea either yet it in my
craft that actually doesn't matter but

564
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,859
that's a good that's a good thought that
is a stone and it is right next to the

565
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:42,600
would any other scenario that would
result in a five-alarm fire actually the

566
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:48,600
problem is that we have placed our chest
on an outside wall and creeper don't

567
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:54,120
care where your chest is creepers on the
other side of the wall your chest is one

568
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,009
block over from it full of your diamonds
if for any reason you're outside

569
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:01,690
piddling around your house creeper shows
up behind you this will happen it has

570
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:06,070
happened to me they will blow up the
segment of your house the Waterhouse and

571
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:10,680
they will take the chest inside so do
not place chests or valuable items

572
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,830
against an exterior wall took me a
little while to learn that when the hard

573
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:15,710
way

574
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:19,470
oh man timing is everything on that one

575
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:23,899
and that's because you're in the day

576
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:29,730
cool got that out of the way here's
another thing you can do you can elevate

577
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:33,000
your valuables you can change their
attitude right so here's another example

578
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,900
I just kind of cut a cross section of
this little bungalow here but you've got

579
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,310
your ground level again not great
operational security down here in moscow

580
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,380
can wander in there but as you can see
I've got writes all around the outside

581
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:47,950
here not many actually have to go up a
floor and then there's a ladder that you

582
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:51,140
have to go up to get to the next level
with the tests are you can elevate your

583
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:55,440
chest or just put them out of reach of
bad guys again a spider could

584
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,670
theoretically crawl over the small but
they can't crawl over that lip and even

585
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:02,010
if they did they can't get inside the
building

586
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:07,960
ok here's another thing that you can do
put stuff down this is what I do in most

587
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,000
of my buildings I generally dig out this
big basement I want my stuff to be

588
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,060
between the level that I live in the
level that I work right so I put all my

589
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:21,250
valuable sort of in between somewhere
and so this is kind of a I don't get

590
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:25,619
this going to make a lot of sense not a
very good presentation of it but you

591
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:28,740
know you go in the store you turn to the
right there's a stairwell that goes down

592
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,740
you take the flight of stairs down I
don't know it's probably thirty flights

593
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:37,060
or something like that and then you step
off into this area where I have my chest

594
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:41,650
and I have all my valuables here and and
so again monsters can still come up from

595
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:45,630
down below but they're so far down and
you flip the corridor so well but

596
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:49,790
generally speaking they're not gonna
come up that come up this step in the

597
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:53,020
old days they did seem to happen a lot
more I don't know they just changed the

598
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,020
way some of the monsters behave but they
don't seem to come up steps

599
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:02,789
to transport transport an interesting
one because in a couple of ways I almost

600
00:44:02,789 --> 00:44:06,809
feel like this is the most analogous to
real-world information security

601
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:17,750
principles that we face here we have
what is obviously a very terrifying

602
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:25,049
picture here for a couple reasons that
that passes it's made of gravel which

603
00:44:25,049 --> 00:44:30,299
sucks to run on and in Minecraft you
actually

604
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:35,849
you lose health and you lose you you
become fatigued as you run and as you do

605
00:44:35,849 --> 00:44:38,740
your activities and things like that
you've got eight in order to get your

606
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:44,939
energy back to do things if you run on a
properly built surface it actually

607
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:50,880
doesn't it you don't incur hunger you
don't lose that energy so this is not a

608
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,640
very good service to run on because it
will result in me losing my hunger bar

609
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:00,569
there is something else wrong with this
picture that path is not lit all I mean

610
00:45:00,569 --> 00:45:05,509
I kind of feel like console and Gretel
once went down this path at some point

611
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:09,420
it's a terrible dark forest there's
probably stuff lurking on either side of

612
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:14,010
the path now this is a little bit better
we've split the pack and actually made

613
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:19,029
the PAP called cobblestone so above and
maybe would I don't know you seem to be

614
00:45:19,029 --> 00:45:22,799
Microtech Burwell would take away your
hunger that I don't know what that is

615
00:45:22,799 --> 00:45:27,730
not okay well maybe it will maybe it
while I don't know but cobblestone

616
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:32,849
definitely will not write stonewall
smooth down any of that stuff while so

617
00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:36,089
when you build foot pads and you build
roads you want to make sure you billed

618
00:45:36,089 --> 00:45:39,940
amount of material that you can call off
the only run off because usually you do

619
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:44,390
not want to linger in this or even
though it's well lit all the lighting

620
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:48,569
does really keep monsters from spawning
on the path that sell just sort of

621
00:45:48,569 --> 00:45:53,200
lingering on the path I guarantee you we
go ten blocks on either side of this

622
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,399
path there are tons of monsters out
there so you always want to make haste

623
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,770
whenever you're running down a path and
you want to make sure that the path is

624
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:02,150
building materials that will allow you
to continue to run

625
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:05,980
so here's an interesting one

626
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:11,309
railroads which in my day we didn't have
power drills we had to create these

627
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:15,960
together little real did anyone ever do
this you create a little carousel rail

628
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,410
and as your card goes by it it pushes
the other card offers and keeps it going

629
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,710
at a really fast momentum that's how I
used to have to do it then they

630
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:27,270
introduced to PowerShell these are
actually not torches in the traditional

631
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:30,779
sense the don't really give off much
light these are just powering israel

632
00:46:30,779 --> 00:46:32,789
brought so I don't want anyone to get
confused

633
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:35,890
these are not actually torches that
protect against monsters these are just

634
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:40,650
torches that power rail so what's wrong
with this picture

635
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:47,200
has no like we are we already
established at what else is wrong with

636
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:54,540
this picture bingo the track is easily
accessible my mom and they will wander

637
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:58,480
onto your track not just bad guys
actually livestock and stuff like that

638
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,150
wander on your track as well and there's
nothing more frustrating than giving it

639
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:08,809
a minecart take it off getting up to go
get a sandwich thinking I'm just gonna

640
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:14,230
ride this ride along to the next up boy
you come back and it's at the game over

641
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:18,510
screen and all their stuff is laying on
the ground mustard I'm you don't even

642
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:24,470
know what happened because you weren't
there so generally what has happened is

643
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:29,549
something has wandered onto the track
has stopped you from moving and then as

644
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:32,839
you sit there and do that sometimes it
will get you back the other way but

645
00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:36,859
there are situations where you can end
up stuck on rail and as you sit there

646
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:40,380
monsters will then walk up and eat your
brains and all that stuff that monsters

647
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:46,050
like to do so there is a way that we can
protect against this it's actually not

648
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:50,400
super clever but it works we just
elevate the track we just raised the

649
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:59,280
track about 20 blocks and this is my my
my we need home over here but we raise

650
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,900
the track about 20 blocks and again we
have to light the track monsters will

651
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,099
still spawn they won't spawn directly on
the track but they will spawn on the

652
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:11,770
blocks on either side of the trap so
again as you can see I like to light the

653
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:15,869
rails every five spaces and then on the
other side of the track I put the power

654
00:48:15,869 --> 00:48:22,200
rails because I'm a sucker for 44 things
at lining up properly and if I had to

655
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,848
choose the corner towards really set me
off I did put them on different sides

656
00:48:26,849 --> 00:48:31,380
trail this week at the light you get the
speed you get the efficiency and you get

657
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:35,880
the protection of being elevated now
another point here is that even when

658
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,970
you've elevated your Rails bad guys can
get on your tracks on this one took me a

659
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:45,020
long time to kind of figure out right we
have a tunnel that the rail goes into

660
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,220
and it hasn't overhead

661
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:50,980
hang right monsters are standing up on
top of that tunnel they walked down a

662
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:54,250
drop on the tunnel and now they're on
your track so now they can walk around

663
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:58,560
retracting end up in your rail stations
it's pretty miserable this is a rail

664
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,270
station again you can see I've employed
a lot of the same techniques here just

665
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:05,060
to protect the rail station it's
elevated

666
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:09,340
need to light under the rail station
much better than it is now because

667
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:12,760
that's not very good I did like the
rails there's a little bit of a

668
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,119
perimeter out here you got some lights
there's a door here that you can't see

669
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:20,080
but overall but I haven't had any
trouble with this rail station

670
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:24,690
here's another here's another tunnel
that you go into and so what I do I just

671
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:28,410
put a fence up you can just put a fence
if you put blocks bad guys will walk

672
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:32,180
over the blocks we need to put a fence
up theoretically could a spider silk

673
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,720
roll over that fence and land on your
track yes but this will cut down almost

674
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:41,209
double again or threat modeling is not
always about eliminating risk you can't

675
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:46,500
eliminate risk but you can address the
risks that you choose to address and I'm

676
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:51,070
ok with the occasional spider falling on
my railroad track to keep the hundreds

677
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:54,050
of zombies awful

678
00:49:54,050 --> 00:50:01,770
alright so we're very close to the end
here which i think is well I'm hoping so

679
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:05,830
a couple of observations I I wanted to
make it i hope most of you took these

680
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:10,259
observations away as we were going
through the presentation because again I

681
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,340
think most of these concepts are
self-evident to information security

682
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:17,810
professionals but what's interesting is
that the younger generation is learning

683
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:23,440
these concepts way before we ever learn
then in ass and setting or in a

684
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,090
professional setting their learning
these concepts sitting at home

685
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:32,710
protecting their diamonds protecting
their houses protecting their friends so

686
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:36,270
that's why I really think this is a
great opportunity for young people to

687
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:40,250
learn about information security
specifically correct modeling and if

688
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:43,280
you're an information security
professional it's a great way to expand

689
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,720
and strengthen your understanding

690
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,580
remodeling a couple observations like
Boehner lighting vulnerabilities are

691
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:53,390
easy to overlook an extremely cost again
there are a lot of classes of

692
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:55,830
vulnerabilities out there that are just
like this

693
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:58,690
cross-site scripting and cross-site
request forgery or two really good ones

694
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:04,090
they're very easy to allow to happen in
your application and the the the impact

695
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:09,340
can be very severe depending on how it's
implemented a layered approach is good

696
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:13,740
and we do need to employ a layered
approach but it is not the end all be

697
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:18,040
all of our security model our security
model has to be much more robust than

698
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:23,060
just a couple of fences and some coaches
I guess that would have been ok for like

699
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:28,330
six entering Lithuania but it's not ok
today and perimeter landscaping fencing

700
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:32,100
walling things all he can do as much of
that as you like and you can do it in

701
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:35,350
ways that are aesthetically pleasing to
you if that's as important to you as it

702
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:41,569
is to me there aren't any single
solutions to all attack attack types

703
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:45,940
right you have to employ a different
control and a different protection for

704
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:50,530
each class of monster basically we also
didn't even talk about all the monsters

705
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:52,869
we talked about

706
00:51:52,869 --> 00:51:57,299
like for mobsters and only monsters in
one world we don't even get to the

707
00:51:57,299 --> 00:52:10,349
nether yes that does not sound like
playing in survival know that sounds

708
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:18,710
like God wanted to make it will catch up
after the presentation on on on that

709
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:24,849
statement so there are lots more bad
guys out here that we haven't talked

710
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:28,400
about and they come at you in different
ways using different weapons and using

711
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,150
different techniques right so this is
only scratching the surface of our

712
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:37,059
threat vectors here in Minecraft and
again there is no one single solution to

713
00:52:37,059 --> 00:52:41,680
all of them and what i think is the most
important takeaway from this discussion

714
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:48,379
is that if efficiency and security are
very costly in Minecraft in order to

715
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:51,720
make an efficient transportation system
you have to spend a lot of time mining

716
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:56,558
precious minerals you need gold need
higher you need wood which he wouldn't

717
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,430
think would was that precious but it can
actually be difficult to get your hands

718
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:05,529
on if you have a set yourself up with it
would bar sounds ridiculous when I hear

719
00:53:05,529 --> 00:53:13,019
myself saying this thing anyway so it's
really very costly and that's true the

720
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:18,538
real world to security doesn't have to
be expensive but the tradeoff between

721
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:23,619
security and user experience or the
tradeoff between security and UI for

722
00:53:23,619 --> 00:53:29,470
security and performance are often quite
expensive tradeoff this is just true I

723
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:32,089
think we would all agree with this and
that's true

724
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:36,769
minecraft as well and again as I pointed
out defenses centered only around

725
00:53:36,769 --> 00:53:41,008
monsters in this talk not players mostly
when you're dealing with other players

726
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:44,670
the best tools that you have at your
disposal her good off it does to wipe

727
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,970
out the competition still other stuff
where they can still hear that's my

728
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:53,640
preferred approach or obfuscation that's
about as good as you can get so what I

729
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,788
do is I actually nevermind so

730
00:53:57,319 --> 00:54:04,190
that's a good point so what I do is I
and i was gonna tell you guys doing so

731
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:11,709
so what I like I build a little redstone
piston wall a false wall and only I know

732
00:54:11,709 --> 00:54:15,379
the place on that wall where I have to
put a redstone torch in order to

733
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:19,259
activate the wall moving out so it'll
just be a nondescript wall or something

734
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:23,979
like that and then I stick the red torch
on like one block and the redstone

735
00:54:23,979 --> 00:54:27,649
circuit connects the Pistons the Pistons
move away and my chest are exposed to me

736
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:31,749
and that's where I put my minerals and
diamonds and things like that again

737
00:54:31,749 --> 00:54:33,430
that's just copy station though right

738
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:37,839
if if if your friend of a real jerk
they're probably just gonna take a pick

739
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:41,390
ax and just like go through all of your
walls of course that leaves an audit

740
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:46,430
trail so we can always go back and know
that someone was in our house although I

741
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:49,828
guess it doesn't I guess you could go
back and replace those stones and cover

742
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:53,130
up your tracks so again we have to
threat model that we gotta find a better

743
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:57,630
way to control access to that and then
my final challenge to everyone is go

744
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:03,519
play minecraft I asked like who likes
information security in who likes threat

745
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:07,328
modeling and no one raised a hand and I
like you like Minecraft everybody raised

746
00:55:07,329 --> 00:55:10,999
their hand look at how many other people
out here and play minecraft already just

747
00:55:10,999 --> 00:55:16,238
go do it it's a great way to learn
threat modeling it intuitively teaches

748
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:20,619
you these concepts I guarantee you you
will spend I guarantee you will spend

749
00:55:20,619 --> 00:55:24,359
five whole minutes in the Minecraft
world before you seriously started

750
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:27,839
threat modeling that's different than
development team development teams it

751
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:31,269
takes them a whole six months to see
their failed efforts

752
00:55:31,269 --> 00:55:37,258
right but in my craft we see our failed
efforts immediately so you will learn

753
00:55:37,259 --> 00:55:41,619
threat modeling if you play Minecraft
and you actually stick to doing it so

754
00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:45,659
what can you do I recommend setting up a
server at your office

755
00:55:45,659 --> 00:55:49,640
dan observateur office and then you know
after five you get everybody get

756
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,339
together play some minecraft nothing you
can do to spice things up you can have a

757
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:56,419
deal for those of you who played
Dungeons dragons and stuff like that you

758
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:59,989
can have an admin on the server to all
he does is drive on moms and mobsters

759
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:04,019
and stuff just to make you mad right
they can call down lightning they can

760
00:56:04,019 --> 00:56:07,828
they can do all kinds of stuff right you
can set up these complex scenarios you

761
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:11,949
can play capture the flag games game of
five right I know that's the new

762
00:56:11,949 --> 00:56:16,729
buzzword that everybody learns of the
new game I know but it's true

763
00:56:16,729 --> 00:56:21,649
minecraft is a great system for this
it's practically built for it so don't

764
00:56:21,649 --> 00:56:23,069
take my word for it

765
00:56:23,069 --> 00:56:27,149
anyone has already made a good play
minecraft seriously stand up a server at

766
00:56:27,149 --> 00:56:30,499
your office find some friends who wanna
play and just emerged yourself then you

767
00:56:30,499 --> 00:56:33,759
will learn threat modeling and it will
improve your ability to take that

768
00:56:33,759 --> 00:56:38,279
information back to work and put it into
practice so that's it for me I

769
00:56:38,279 --> 00:56:40,869
appreciate everybody's taking tight if
you have questions I'll be happy to

770
00:56:40,869 --> 00:56:44,119
answer them otherwise thanks for having
me and have safe trip
