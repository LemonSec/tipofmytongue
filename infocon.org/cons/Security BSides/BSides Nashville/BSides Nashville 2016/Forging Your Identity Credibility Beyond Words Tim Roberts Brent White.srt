1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
on red teaming what to do what not to do
things like that

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,700
city just gotta wonder down here
actually how many people in your next

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:15,579
event testers penetration that's a red t
me things like that stuff about the blue

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:21,920
team's ass I think that you're going to
get some benefits from the start

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,720
matter what side you're on on
identifying things and it also the red

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:41,920
team having that extra mile so see my
face but working so when you're looking

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,600
at its go being a few things you wanna
talk look at when you are setting this

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,539
up for a routine so it what's this isn't
scenario-based you know is this a bank

9
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:01,039
do you have certain 71 people trying to
get you to get is you know what what

10
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,519
kind of company is it what are they have
what's the ultimate and gold ultimate

11
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,880
treasure chest that you don't ever want
to have compromised and so you know you

12
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,740
mentioned a few different things this
could incorporate offices whatever

13
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:23,830
typically the gold mine as a server want
to get their server in there he got

14
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:32,400
access to the course but you might want
to push out a little bit further target

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:44,060
individuals fishing whatever ya images
made shows may or may not have been

16
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,710
chosen while we're drinking bourbon

17
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,639
so it should be interesting
reconnaissance so we're also clear off

18
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,530
earlier with with open source
intelligence obviously that's that's

19
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,040
where you look at the target ok what
departments do they have what are some

20
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,340
names of people on the part of the
department's things such as LinkedIn

21
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,780
Google so many resources out there you
can go and sort of get an idea may be

22
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,459
who you want to go after or maybe just
do your backstory that way you can have

23
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:19,190
something intelligent to say when you
encounter someone this can also be given

24
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:26,450
the job posting what kind of
environmental rules to know that stuff

25
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,799
because it does help you flush out your
back stories so if you get back into the

26
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:39,970
corners question I root beer so you're
not a medical card so you want to make

27
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:48,650
sure that you were just whatever
fictitious story about with your culture

28
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:56,510
for example right now I don't wanna hear
it appeared that may not be appearance

29
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,470
to go to some places because they may
have some federal clients that they have

30
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,930
restrictions on that so I can I pay
attention to how the employees dress you

31
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,299
can observe that from a parking water
whatever during lunch breaks coming out

32
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:18,510
Starbucks next to the company easy to
also get their match how bad is it a

33
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:24,130
good idea that bad you're still it or
whatever you know

34
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,660
opportune parents always pay attention
to the culture and dress Co

35
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,810
and that goes right along with the
prepared guys' everyone wearing a suit

36
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:41,040
and tie and do they have maintenance
your instruction going on maybe they

37
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,980
have construction they have guys from
eighteen years something walking around

38
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,590
with a hard hat clip words just those
are all things you know what's going on

39
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:57,709
What can i jump in and become a part of
said those are all things to do before

40
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:02,239
you go in there a good thing to do also
if you look at the visitor log in a lot

41
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:09,209
of these companies you can see a list of
vendors to show you now ok well just

42
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,739
dropping Kodak or whatever they've got
these vendors who now have a list of

43
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:19,660
some guys that I can go home and start
creating ordering uniforms or whatever

44
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,290
so pay attention I mean those little
things that sometimes we don't even

45
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:28,190
consider going there we don't think oh I
forgot the sign and blog right here now

46
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:36,900
I can drop a bunch of names departments
and contractors be bold and confident

47
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,690
also this is very important especially
for social engineering if you know a lot

48
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,199
of people there some guys on our team to
integrate social engineers little

49
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,300
technical knowledge and there's some
darling extreme technical knowledge they

50
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:58,680
get really nervous so it's important
before you do any kind of social

51
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,180
engineering work specially on inside
your face to face and somebody a little

52
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,590
bit more intimidating but you have that
confidence that you display that ad

53
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:12,750
bility to roll with the punches or even
if you can

54
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:25,389
should not do that at the same time so
let's get into a quick story there is a

55
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:31,009
client that he and another guy reminds
you and it was in a small sweet they

56
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:35,069
were a new client weren't really sure
what happens after hours you know what

57
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:41,589
time do people leave we figured around
54 35 but it was hard to tell with the

58
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:47,909
single point of injury like you know who
stays and works late so we found our way

59
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:53,360
up stairwell and we heard voices on the
other side door we weren't sure it was

60
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,559
cleaning crew warfare employees so
basically after that a pretty poor

61
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:05,199
system for us to get in it was just the
four button in injury so on her

62
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,029
thirteenth try we guessed it we have
opened it up and it was the cleaning

63
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:14,369
crew and they just so happen to be going
through another door as he came as two

64
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:21,819
than its so that kinda goes along with
what was talking about bball been scared

65
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:26,429
to be caught or whatever and never taken
that chance and heard voices and turn

66
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:32,299
around long story short we walked around
the place they are supposed to be

67
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,649
security guard watching the cameras we
found all the information we need to

68
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:41,729
find and then we always want to get the
client chance catches given the benefit

69
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:46,699
of the doubt what can we do so we can be
caught so we stood in front of the glass

70
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:52,539
doors and there is a happens physical
gap doors and motion sensor on the other

71
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:58,199
side so I had a clothes hanger and some
napkins tired and stuck it to the door

72
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,329
and I was like well let's see if the
security guards paying attention

73
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:03,940
literally standing there doing this

74
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:09,560
and the door I actually don't know but I
think that degree was too much to pick

75
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,350
up their thing so put it down later
there and then we stand in front or rear

76
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:21,410
facing camera and we start doing jumping
and the security guard never came so we

77
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:28,230
did that for about five or six minutes
and we got tired so so again that's you

78
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:33,130
know where security so that kind of
attention when everybody leave on top of

79
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:38,480
yet take some risks had someone
approached us we had what we thought was

80
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,430
a good back story but fortunately for
the company wouldn't get a chance to

81
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:50,620
have a confrontation I guess everyone
including check out for the day so Jason

82
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,620
mentioned earlier getting on purpose

83
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,430
a great point once you get in there gone
pretty much looted the plane leave

84
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,500
well that's when he also got to consider
is incident handling her spots are

85
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,660
retesting see if they follow so that's
also one of the motivating factors when

86
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:19,090
he tried to make offer to Sabathia
vacillate properly so I always keep that

87
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:27,549
in the back so few things I want to do a
quick will exercise great menotti

88
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:34,560
there's a few things you can do when you
are approached and someone's doing a

89
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:42,299
typical sales tactic has he ever asking
the question is the one drawn so you

90
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,300
know if you go on the play place and
someone asked the question immediately

91
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,219
answer that with no question that takes
some practice if you're not used to

92
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,860
doing that offered so we have some tips
so for example if I go into a place they

93
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:05,030
tend to security guard and he asked me
like a bad looking around

94
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:26,120
arms probably be careful you know if you
know where my car keys the right here in

95
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,010
a little bit we're gonna go to lunch
murders is awesome BBQ place around do

96
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:34,170
you know anything about that just mean
that sounds silly but just a quick hey

97
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,680
where where do you suggest go watch and
so it's a quick way to put the question

98
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,560
back on them and hopefully they're going
up the answer it then you can kind of

99
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,329
get some camaraderie going on

100
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:51,090
build that trust and eventually you know
I left my car back I'll go get it which

101
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:57,200
is much easier than don't have one ok
well you're coming and then you're

102
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,640
busted you know so at least you have a
way to get out and try again later

103
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:13,890
recently they figure out there and he's
talking security guard distracting him

104
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,900
but they found out prior to that
security guard love sex and the city so

105
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,610
let's talk about sex and the city and I
get this conversation about it for a

106
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:26,590
while the other guys meeting in if you
haven't seen it you don't like a tiger

107
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:36,780
teams coach be able to carry on a
conversation like that even you know

108
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,500
Jason mentioned wanting to establish
this action figure on their Captain

109
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,500
America Latin America really your
favorite

110
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:51,479
go talk about that stuff vested in that
little bit easier

111
00:10:52,850 --> 00:11:02,180
redirection so this stranger this is
something that tastes like acting

112
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,239
improperly classes like that i three way
to do it

113
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,480
go to the mall sit down next to total
strangers have a conversation about your

114
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,620
entire life but your entire life or
something that you

115
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,650
are making up on the fly you never tell
them the truth and do it in a way but

116
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:23,579
we're it's believable and if you're
terrible at it they're gonna wanna know

117
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,970
that you're a bad liar you tryin you can
also try with the redirection whenever

118
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,900
someone asks just a simple conversation
when someone ask your question answered

119
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,300
them with a question again takes
practice to do that where you're

120
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,729
comfortable and where it seems natural
as opposed to you know stuttering a

121
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:48,260
little bit and making it work and
natural where I'm trying to trying to

122
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:58,040
get you on track so practice that is
it's a good way for improv so here it

123
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:17,370
doesn't hurt you can stay there so
terrible fail so they won't do it

124
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:56,040
building

125
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,959
nervous and jittery if you've got kind
of an established background and

126
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,439
something already and you can put that
in there somehow you're gonna be a

127
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:17,089
little bit more naturally comfortable
talking about something for the exercise

128
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:21,980
mp3 going and cold this is kind of an
exercise we are working on when we were

129
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:30,170
trying to come to make a class workshop
or I think this is a good exercise maybe

130
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:36,569
to do with some coworkers and stuff but
you say hey one person that they know

131
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:40,170
three things they know the name of the
company to have the name of the company

132
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:45,380
they have a point of contact me and they
know where the server other person

133
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:50,880
dependents dropped in you don't know
anything other than the name of the

134
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,930
company and where it's at

135
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,859
so you're dropped in the parking lot
last minute you're in your approach you

136
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,029
walk inside your goal is to find out
this three things about giving yourself

137
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:06,579
away in it and by directing the congress
you find that out and say hey what do

138
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:13,579
you guys do and what's the name of your
network server that so doing that kind

139
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:19,729
of exercise can help you with that also
distinct why and tying all three that

140
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:25,639
resides in profits so important and I
encourage a lot of people get into

141
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:32,220
social engineering and whether it's over
the phone or whether it's an onside take

142
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,930
an improv class especially if you're
engaging in real time conversation it's

143
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:41,199
easier than email because you can get
his message was we send it out most

144
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,620
China some poorly worded fishing

145
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:50,200
but you if you do that you know it's not
that was hard but when you're talking to

146
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,630
somebody on the phone or face-to-face is
somebody's linden and it's hard to get

147
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:59,689
that adrenaline back then have all these
nonverbal cues that you don't even know

148
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:13,840
that you're doing so we could have
ulterior try business talking alright

149
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:23,450
alright so hot my fathers and their
widows

150
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:46,980
dropped in to find out what they do and
yeah I see walk and security guard looks

151
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,980
at you

152
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:10,748
that's incredible

153
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:51,970
and that's that's right away

154
00:16:51,970 --> 00:17:00,899
make them automatically become the
biggest jerk in the room like I've got

155
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,740
this meeting and I'm I bust my butt to
get here and I'm not gonna let someone

156
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,609
like you make me late and it is go on
and on and on and get your supervisor in

157
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:12,469
here right now they're gonna know I am
and you're going to be in you know

158
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:17,500
whatever so just just kind of going over
the top people hate confrontation

159
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:23,270
people love their help we're all you
know most people are kind hearted by

160
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:28,710
nature and so whenever you bring
confrontation they want to avoid that

161
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,520
and most people would say you know me
and I've got problems I don't feel like

162
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:40,150
here and you right now just go on and I
hear ya whatever but don't tie into that

163
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:51,330
we are doing here we had two consultants
and they they were pregnant so they

164
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:55,139
played on that act like they were a
couple and they were arguing and ended

165
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:02,730
up getting into some a charter schools
are you and they just closed the door

166
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:15,160
that kind of stuff worse counter to that
some security guards they've been

167
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,040
waiting and I'm not you know I'm not
bashing that at all because it's good

168
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:31,000
when you're aware that so always kind of
way he situation and try to determine

169
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,620
what that person's

170
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:37,469
Julie divided somebody right if you're
angry or they're very defensive all fly

171
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:43,790
well maybe you don't want to start
throwing abrasive tone right and

172
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:48,950
sometimes you gotta be a little nicer we
don't want to you know any specific

173
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:53,820
books are some great books out there but
this is one that yeah I won't say that

174
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,050
again cause we're not trying to endorse
products or anything but this is one

175
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:03,090
that really kind of revisiting its got
some good refreshers on body language

176
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:10,699
nonverbal cues how to speed read written
by ex-fbi agent and it's got speed

177
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:17,430
reading people you know things like i
Roy nervous habits waves just pick up to

178
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:39,590
see if somebody's hiding something from
here maybe in reading people this is a

179
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,530
really good refresher or that otherwise
if you're brand new to it

180
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:49,550
good ideas but maybe things that you
want to sort of scottie it will be good

181
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,290
for RED team

182
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,120
got a question

183
00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:07,989
lot of prep work i think is firstly I
usually like a figure that bad you have

184
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:13,820
that on me at all times and really get
into you consider backup plans here for

185
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:19,050
just those people without getting into
too prematurely

186
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:25,629
I will say that you know where you got
to be a little bit more nicer can't let

187
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:30,429
them know that you're defeated so being
too nice to learn it too low

188
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,850
now I don't have confidence in you more
and i feel like im crying and slowing

189
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:42,120
down people that are good at their jobs
they pick up on that feeling of

190
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,469
automatically and some people just it
gives them even more of a feeling of

191
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:53,240
power to drag you out into the parking
lot so my other one of my other

192
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:59,000
contestants to that I did prior to
solution area alongside with a guy and

193
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,740
security guard their site the words of
Bangalore's you know in the front door

194
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,570
and their security guard there so you
also need to choose how you're entering

195
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:15,080
the building if it if it's just one area
and a security guard their stuff and you

196
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,409
know you're restricted to that area but
often sounds like an emergency exit

197
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:23,660
doors especially around lunch you see
people coming in that other opportune

198
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:31,420
times the size but she got his faith in
strips that is something that most

199
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:38,170
people don't pay attention to the motion

200
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,480
yeah we've we've addressed

201
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,350
backing techniques and things like that
in some of our talks that we don't wanna

202
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:51,090
keep repeating everything but if you're
interested in some of those how to play

203
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,418
on the help of nature of others

204
00:21:54,419 --> 00:22:40,790
sounds terrible saying that come talk to
us afterwards me and my girl moving on

205
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:50,080
so carry on set up again

206
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:56,870
Google results take pictures so and in
the abstract of the talk we mentioned

207
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:04,799
about forging fake ID hands which we
have to be very careful on what we

208
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,490
talked about what that kind of the next
time to get to indefinite with that but

209
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,059
yeah you wanna talk about that

210
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:28,580
ok so depending on the kind of idea to
always make sure you're doing even part

211
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:33,870
of a statement of work in the car and
say here's kind of our method is our

212
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:41,850
methodology is what we usually do we're
gonna try to distill the barrage you

213
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:48,429
know we don't have a time we're just
gonna try to make a Photoshop or take

214
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:54,390
one or two so just you know just always
make sure I think the most important

215
00:23:54,390 --> 00:24:03,030
takeaway to that is because they've got
some kind of military IDs

216
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:11,600
yeah and you also don't like forged
badge is in person at officers things

217
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:19,570
that is so Google results can you say
I'm so I went with with Microsoft

218
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:25,639
Microsoft rep I talked to James
environment I T

219
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,620
some people will say okay well actually
take the time to Google or if you're

220
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,969
trying to set up in the air hey do you
have some time on Tuesday that's how I

221
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,550
am here is my number there are few
websites out there where you can

222
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,730
actually pay and have them generate fake

223
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,710
result so when you search for it why
Microsoft

224
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:48,580
come up online Microsoft Microsoft sales
rep things like that see you soon now

225
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:55,929
you have that there are also some
specific are also asked out there that

226
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,320
will spoof your number so if you're
doing social engineering hall or

227
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:04,090
something like that you can call and
it'll actually have say it if you know

228
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:10,040
what the internal like the internal
extension for the idea department so you

229
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,590
make it look like it's coming from you
know 12:32 or whatever and someone

230
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:19,379
answered I T Department calling but
you're nowhere in the building and then

231
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,380
you can say hey this is so and so that I
T

232
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:28,760
install this patch really quick so those
are just some help helpful tools to help

233
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:34,080
build credibility with your Mac stories
like storing numbers to my Google Voice

234
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,668
and stuff like that

235
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:40,539
having the area codes when I first
started to talk about mistakes are

236
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:47,179
adjacent to the stakes but first I
actually forgot the block my number area

237
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,120
code

238
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:58,059
wait a minute and they call so if you're
doing any kind of fishing from a phone

239
00:25:58,059 --> 00:25:59,940
number

240
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:07,240
blocking or something you know it's
always good to have those numbers you

241
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,799
mentioned the letter of authorization
and you were talking earlier so we

242
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:19,889
usually have a backup plan is a fake
Twitter so what is a good example of

243
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:24,090
this next slide basically you're gonna
take your letter of authorization you

244
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:29,610
don't want to be exactly word for word
what you want to just kind of strip out

245
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:33,559
some of the very best to make it as
vague as possible to do this this and

246
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:42,889
this and then he also wants to have a
fake number to contact prints from ABC

247
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:48,950
corporation from the office of the CIS
member so there's a problem call this

248
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:54,649
guy so what happens is you get this guy
that's really confrontational have an

249
00:26:54,649 --> 00:27:04,580
appointment letter out and I swear this
happened to me I had a security company

250
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:09,500
these guys were armed too and I've been
walking around while I got him through

251
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,429
the fire the emergency exit the head
during the day pick a large set of basic

252
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:20,610
walk there we got in walking and walking
around and do my thing and I was looking

253
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:23,870
through the security guard come true

254
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:32,919
why do you do it just you know of
something and i just want to make sure

255
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,210
our in 2006 your back

256
00:27:37,210 --> 00:28:43,240
showed it is like no but you have a fake
company name and if you're testing

257
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,580
incident response is an excellent way to
test that because our the escalating it

258
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:53,100
did they call them and they did how did
they know that person has the authority

259
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:58,030
to grant us permission they don't so
they should have what they should have a

260
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:04,309
list of that so this is an example of
this is actually one we've used you know

261
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,309
we've truncated some of the day time
that the loader there but

262
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:16,120
I know it's it's pretty pretty tiny
there but you'll see that I we even get

263
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,570
into some of the details about dumpster
diving stuff like that I changed it can

264
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:25,970
be there twenty four seven are expanded
the days I put a bunch of BS in there

265
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:31,570
and also said that I can walk out with
company resources so if I had a laptop

266
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:38,800
in my hand even say anything so this has
never actually you know I don't want to

267
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:46,550
jinx myself but I never actually had to
use a time I have had to have actually

268
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:52,690
used a fake Twitter and it's worked and
so you know you're giving them another

269
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,310
chance they did well and it should be in
the commendable practices yeah they're

270
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:00,830
security awareness they're the guys stop
me no questions saw that it was a fake

271
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:06,790
badge but he didn't follow through you
just take my word for it and that was my

272
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:12,830
kind of my back and so I really
encourage fake letter of authorization

273
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:17,870
could probably burning in some instances
it's it's a good backup

274
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:54,600
we actually put in there that the client
has to go through all extent so that it

275
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:09,090
specifically says that because of all
that is used to make sure that we are

276
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,059
not detained by company

277
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:20,678
local or federal agencies basically
don't arrest our guys that's wassup so

278
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:24,289
here it is

279
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:28,750
non-disclosure agreements are so we
could leave the real ones on there but

280
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:35,610
these are very similar to ones that we
have crafted one on the right I

281
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:40,899
basically sat down at a coffee shop that
was connected to a building during

282
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:46,080
breakfast so I as I was sitting there I
just crafted it on my laptop while

283
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:52,120
people then I walked across the street
back to my hotel have them printed off

284
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:58,029
and i got really funny what was this bad
thing printed off and then I also asked

285
00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:06,419
for scissors and tape before just coming
up and asking for that conversation with

286
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:13,539
the lady about her her kids and share
some tape and scissors thank you ma'am

287
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:22,658
when I cross the street and so it's just
that easy so you know it's funny cuz I

288
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:30,850
got there and I had no idea what they're
bad about some of the suspects were

289
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:36,600
actually doing another talk about said
Mark security when you guys are doing

290
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:42,178
this kind of stuff don't always do the
tests haven't done it

291
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:49,269
ok well the bad guys have a lot more
time a lot more resources to

292
00:32:52,610 --> 00:33:03,320
so when you rush like that sometimes you
gotta think so what happened was again

293
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:10,570
because companies these companies that
you guys have stopped and got an

294
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:19,540
external walk facing outward upgrade
course they're probably something stuff

295
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:25,678
so I got in there and I actually got
into an administrator's office and she

296
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,650
had letterheads envelopes on this stuff
well at that point I got a good look at

297
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:38,299
what the bat and I went to bathroom I
was rippin licking and pillar tripping

298
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:43,490
up these envelopes and stuff and I had a
picture by picture that I usually keep

299
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:48,690
on me and I made it a bad picking them
as hop each other and layers in one of

300
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:55,140
those plastic sleeves and I thought of a
pretty good really put it together but

301
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:00,040
it worked for that first day that later
not right I was able to go to my hotel

302
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:07,960
same thing is the hotel was able to go
there and come up with the fact that you

303
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,129
print off and it look pretty decent
something that I've been doing too as

304
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:18,589
you know is the medicine and I'm sure
mr. robot at alderson as my my alias

305
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:24,889
just just to see and nobody knows who it
is but it's funny people coming and

306
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:27,410
going and doing this

307
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:34,210
in addition to the badges that's the
kind of the standard size but if you get

308
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:41,520
on him as on anything but it's six bucks
yeah she's stack of them so even if

309
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,320
you're cloning badges or you just want
to make a handful of fate

310
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:52,330
mentioned open source intelligence
earlier here sometimes you can find

311
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:57,509
company photos like a company function
people hanging out with their cocktails

312
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,680
and they've got their badge on dedust
June on the picture

313
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,520
see what company bad go on site first
that we don't have to use hotel planner

314
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:12,020
or whatever can already have a few years
with you that way maybe they have two or

315
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:17,060
three different types not sure how
recent picture is make one up like that

316
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:34,960
have it with you when you get there just
in the right wanna be underway with your

317
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,150
lies by if you're not able to just kind
of talk on the flyer quick conversation

318
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:45,690
and i cant force it can be a little bit
difficult especially if you're not

319
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:52,130
really stuck with your story like
stumbling over security networking ask

320
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:58,290
you to her apartment we don't even have
a networking or whatever and people do i

321
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,210
mean when they catch you you'll have a
good conversation with you think you're

322
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,510
going some way

323
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:07,820
get some traction and then all of a
sudden you don't want to mess up so

324
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:18,280
being short and sweet is is a beautiful
thing thanks to that is as bad joke

325
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,539
sorry I was never say that again

326
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:32,089
so that's why I was gonna stand down 43
right keeping it friendly but don't

327
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:33,689
don't go overboard

328
00:36:33,689 --> 00:36:39,339
talking and you're just start talking
about a whole bunch of stuff and I get

329
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:44,799
so involved in my site covers
distracting but I end up giving myself

330
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:49,519
and it's happened before so you know
just like what they tell a lot of people

331
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:57,479
may say the same thing for us we're
coming in testing and doing an

332
00:36:57,479 --> 00:37:03,959
assessment we want to keep it vague and
let them know I did we did a while back

333
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:13,129
and I mentioned a story no repeat the
story of all all the information she was

334
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:17,919
like my badge you know I'm Center
talking territories new shoes like I'm

335
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:28,949
here are the kids and I was looking for
a building and I noticed they were

336
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:37,640
generators on the side of power
generator size soon so I mean they're ok

337
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,549
well I was meeting in the data center in
the security guard comes up because

338
00:37:41,549 --> 00:37:50,079
somebody had called and said a guy here
one around him out she and anytime

339
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,400
you're able to establish a rapport with
these people and their actual

340
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,209
authorities in there it's good you're
good to go

341
00:37:57,209 --> 00:38:03,999
so even just running back a conversation
what are your plans for you it's amazing

342
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:08,379
how much people answered things for you
without you asking them asking the

343
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:14,469
question another trick that were used to
build on that you're talking to someone

344
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:20,479
on the phone hey we're from security
password audit to make sure that meets

345
00:38:20,479 --> 00:38:24,198
password complexity we're showing that
your current path toward his kittens

346
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:28,380
1300 my password is OK

347
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:36,650
thank you so much just learned how to
this is what people assume that you know

348
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:43,200
the answer will give you the answer so
much that's not a thing you're not on

349
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,828
that side of it just be careful and i'm
glad everything you know so you must be

350
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:58,190
looking for the server room right there
you know they'll be careful what you say

351
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:03,609
I don't work story here this is pretty
funny i mean another co-worker drink

352
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:10,759
over soon we're going in he had a
contractor that I had a fact that he was

353
00:39:10,759 --> 00:39:14,769
a contractor and I was so you walk
through the front where the security

354
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:19,939
guard is preoccupied talking people
there the turnstile jumped over the

355
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:27,029
fence though they didn't say very
oblivious security guard but whatever

356
00:39:27,029 --> 00:39:35,029
its part where day in the office so we
know we we go to this networking

357
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:39,599
department they got a proximity reader
but they also have a letter in your

358
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,289
pocket

359
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:45,599
nobody said anything people walking by
and that it

360
00:39:47,690 --> 00:40:00,280
my keys so I'm using it I get in the
networking Department of the door told

361
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,440
basically like this

362
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,980
think needs more like this long got a
piano string in a little bit under their

363
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:21,020
clash industry and it's enough to not
date wire that its yeah yeah it's rapes

364
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:28,300
against the side of its very loud so so
we were allowed at this point because we

365
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:37,540
had some other things and whatever we
did it regarding the networking

366
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:41,730
department and everything departments
connected to the server the server room

367
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:50,869
has a heart locket bypasses the electron
there in jerusalem for me and i could

368
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:57,099
get the server or in there that they had
a short book women how to remotely

369
00:40:57,099 --> 00:41:01,780
connect using the VPN they had a list of
some accounts the head of security

370
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:10,260
system is already logged into for their
IDs and stuff and so I solved through so

371
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:15,980
after and therefore we decide to leave
and this is where the funding for we

372
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:20,990
walk by his roommates rooms and we look
in there you can look through the glass

373
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:26,990
it's not anything we're getting there
there's cameras everywhere those screens

374
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:31,419
they've got their DVR they've got a
badge printer for

375
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:40,319
they've got a box big aluminum box with
the keys inside of 22 although that

376
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:45,369
facility they had it to a certain extent
women another facility and had vehicle

377
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:52,670
so anyway I'm their control room they
didn't have anything but normal

378
00:41:52,670 --> 00:42:10,729
residential get in there looking around
I see I'm going through the tease like

379
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:25,910
server room number two and so we're not
allowed to take so what I do I got my

380
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:32,808
camera smartphone said nikita I took a
picture of it took several pictures from

381
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:38,599
that night it was arts and crafts or
solution area and close to pick up some

382
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:42,619
files actually went there we actually
tried to get the guys to to print she

383
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:47,410
off for us because I had used to plant
my plastic hotel and I cut it in the

384
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:51,699
shape of the key just to see if he would
do you know do it and actually try

385
00:42:51,699 --> 00:43:04,459
credit whatever credit to do that if he
were there who's gonna do it well we got

386
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:07,118
there were all trying to make these keys

387
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:14,999
well if you look here the top 18 is the
real P be identified using the picture

388
00:43:14,999 --> 00:43:24,439
we got back he work she work and so even
taking a picture of Vicki and filing is

389
00:43:24,439 --> 00:43:28,519
a possibility good just think outside of
the box with that but the funniest part

390
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:41,629
of this story is we've really gotta try
to pull out my keys and key chain

391
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:56,680
get my hands on some of these kids
enjoying it doesn't work but he said he

392
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:38,060
wants to control so I really security
company physical security there one of

393
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:48,600
the first barriers just hand over the
keys that someone said they came from or

394
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,600
why does this guy like he doesn't his
keyword

395
00:44:52,420 --> 00:45:03,950
anything right number sixty or whatever
that was so we talked about what happens

396
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:07,509
when you do use the fake one and that
isn't working you gotta give your all

397
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:14,109
and so an assessment they did talk about
the bad weather made the badge on

398
00:45:14,109 --> 00:45:19,470
Photoshop files in the cafe so that I
went into that building was great knock

399
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:25,069
on the front door to single sleep told
her there for maintenance I was there to

400
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:33,180
do inventory and she's like ok here's my
badge like I'm near work yet so let me

401
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,680
and she said well you probably don't
know where the server is either never

402
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:41,259
been here before this he takes me and
props and says I'll be at my desk come

403
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,360
get me when you're done

404
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:49,070
so that was great walked around she even
opened the doors for me for the CEO of

405
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:54,840
that was their great thank her for her
time is that ok this next place with us

406
00:45:54,840 --> 00:46:01,310
and clients going to be so much fun
because it's a huge to building campus

407
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:05,220
huge parking lot gigantic

408
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:12,080
finally get in there so apparently had
had to tell the client what had happened

409
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:17,569
as I was driving from this place to an
hour north of there are other happy

410
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:21,080
about that time I got this other place I
find out now

411
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:26,900
pretty positive she told him I was
coming because again it is a Corporate

412
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:33,150
Park Blocks buildings huge parking lot
there were probably close to 200 cars

413
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:40,730
there walked around the first building
people were pretty good about not giving

414
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:43,000
information is the previous year

415
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:49,030
him actually did an assessment there and
just pieces so this year was gonna

416
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:53,480
happen again they were sure about that
whatever they had to do was tell people

417
00:46:53,480 --> 00:47:00,000
hey this is going on right now with this
guy so so walk around the first

418
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,540
buildings talked to a few people had
homework gotta go to that building check

419
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:11,190
and get a visitor badge ok so if you
stare also I was looking at maybe going

420

421
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:24,930
the store opened it and it just goes
into a room with hoses air ducts and

422
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:31,440
dirty to go so it's close that back

423
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:42,430
walking around the building and take two
steps and I see it and wrap someone just

424
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:44,940
turn around

425

okay it happened finally so following

428
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:16,450
this guy insiders like it said exactly
what the hell are you talking about it

429
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:22,390
which is like I'm here to an assessment
and was like I've got a pocket sorry and

430
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:34,609
its yours contact Ashley look at this
point he's just not listening to be

432
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,940
there and I explained to the
receptionist who is the same

433
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:50,480
receptionist 2010 really hard last year
oh yeah I need guys were doing that

434
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:58,490
again this year is like here and there
are a few phone calls and I was like all

435
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:02,029
right about the continued to see if
there are any sort of visible

436
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:07,090
vulnerabilities that I can help you guys
out with sure that's alright phone calls

437
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:12,690
by this time for people were surrounding
me in this lobby including the gigantic

438
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:15,290
Gigantor God

439
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:24,700
and breadth brian is really a weirdo
anyway

440
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:29,250
H R director comes out who you say you
are aware and some other time I was kind

441
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:35,300
of confused because there is set to say
yeah you can continues its like Adams

442
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:42,290
MIT I'm supposed to meet a guy here in
server room inventory ok let me see your

443
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:47,759
badge and I was like oh she really want
to know who was like ok here's my letter

444
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,390
doesn't really AM here's the lady that
said it's okay for me to come do this

445
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:57,770
you need to stand here I came back my
bad had been ripped and she said this is

446
00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:05,560
bad and hands it back to me let's make
some phone calls and hands it back to me

447
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:15,770
and before I could say anything she's ok
so hey what can you do you know I wasn't

448
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:21,910
gonna run because I was really far away
my car and really high and I'm kinda way

449
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:29,759
so I don't want to get shot back either
but those no armed and very probably

450
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:37,420
just a community so so I mean you can't
really do anything right games over but

451
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:41,860
at that point again I'm pretty sure that
they always come in the security guard

452
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:47,380
told me I watched you from the moment
you got out of your car and I watched

453
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:51,590
you walk around every single going in
every movie made it and I said well did

454
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:58,840
you see me pick the maintenance closet
door over there is no camera over there

455
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:04,630
and only one security guard for the
whole company had 10 with us he probably

456
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:12,160
could've gotten while I was getting
busted so sometimes you just can't

457
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,540
really get out of it and you've got to
be honest and comply

458
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:22,730
so you don't get tackled or so you're
not losing right it's Jason saying I

459
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:32,420
really enjoyed you know exactly what he
was talking about those sides and

460
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:41,500
incident response so I know that so when
you are committing them yeah that's a

461
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:45,780
good thing I mean that's what you're
testing us the results the conference's

462
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:53,490
working or not you know not something
for you no way around it I totally on

463
00:51:53,490 --> 00:52:06,450
these guys have staged a competition yet
so that's that's one of the things that

464
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:10,509
that it right away I was like hey we did
this last year we got quite a bit of

465
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:18,360
stuff you're on top of you got me and I
was gonna show this kid that's to show

466
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:22,060
so one of the first things I did after
they asked me to leave the premises like

467
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:27,390
all their client contact and said this
when he didn't go as well for me but you

468
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:30,069
guys did great at a coffee right away

469
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:35,330
here are the names of people that were
involved in and we're very very vigilant

470
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:40,880
about what was going on so great job on
that she's pretty happy about the

471
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:46,330
results so so another story

472
00:52:51,760 --> 00:53:00,320
well afterwards a real quick wrapping up
whenever you are getting your things

473
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:05,550
about to leave always know that I
revisit this go well what were you

474
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:10,240
looking for you know where did you take
good notes sometimes it's hard to take

475
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,490
notes as you're sweating you're trying
not to get caught what are you going to

476
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,959
go to the bathroom is one of my favorite
places to go because it's a great office

477
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:24,830
said his stall do what you gotta do too
much in the right so taken out to get

478
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:37,230
laws you know somebody around or
something like that always make sure you

479
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:46,950
get that because you know there's been
almost left in my program you know it's

480
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:51,890
got good stuff right so you gotta go
back and better things to make sure you

481
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:55,089
taking plenty of pictures that you could
remember at the end of this there's

482
00:53:55,090 --> 00:54:00,100
always a report that's expected more
stuff that you take pictures of an

483
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:06,110
interrupt easier life going to be when
you put together so clean up you know if

484
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:19,820
your property is this article is that
response part of it is that when we go

485
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:25,350
back and try to push the envelope try to
get you the most ridiculous thing again

486
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:34,110
until you get caught by any questions or
anything for us and this kind of high

487
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:45,300
level there's been told that's not
really something that can be done

488
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:50,670
because of privacy so we haven't done
that it's not really anything that's

489
00:54:50,670 --> 00:55:49,150
been asked yet either so that I actually
wasn't saying something both sides in

490
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:53,780
those guys are incredibly talented you
know seek help in picking all is always

491
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:59,900
crazy like stuff that I honestly but
when it comes to an engagement you're

492
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:04,500
trying to get an hour then you will use
keys will use rakes long distance go

493
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:10,010
because it's quick gets in and out
what's in store for that it works for us

494
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:14,000
but then we also you're doing so well
you're writing it you're scratching or

495
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,310
whatever which in some cases we we could
but I've never had a client come back

496
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:23,440
and complain hey we noticed two little
scratches on the inside of a pin on this

497
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,830
backdoor you know we took it apart and
lick that it still using that mark is my

498
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:35,810
first question right he's being the
trash anyway yeah but you know you need

499
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:40,290
to be able to and I say this as a
professional and I know especially lot

500
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:45,120
of physical security guys out there that
maybe see this video or whatever you

501
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:55,910
know it's important you killed it you
think you know sometimes it's nice to be

502
00:56:55,910 --> 00:57:04,560
able to fall back on that because not
all the more complex laws and also to

503
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:13,299
use wafer like a way for walks got a
good things were great for cash and some

504
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,300
ATMs maybe

505
00:57:18,130 --> 00:58:01,809
there hasn't really been kind of the
opportunity to do that because a lot of

506
00:58:01,809 --> 00:58:06,049
times though we do so many of these
things will send us one at a time that

507
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:08,980
maybe it's like if you have a team and
you have somebody that can kind of

508
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:13,960
pushing through or something it would
work better but I haven't had the chance

509
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:24,480
to that but that is actually pretty
attacked the whole life coaches or more

510
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:32,190
easier to you have to runner especially
when it's raining to soaking wet patches

511
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:42,200
so just a I know it's it's a terrible
when you're talking about a man that is

512
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:49,109
so wrong but the reality is that you
have criminals out there that don't care

513
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:54,808
and they do these they would generally
do these things to gain access so it is

514
00:58:54,809 --> 00:58:58,269
good to practice this thing so that
people can be aware to strengthen your

515
00:58:58,269 --> 00:59:02,729
security posture so unfortunately that
has to be something that will consider

516
00:59:08,359 --> 00:59:24,880
think so windows when are the criminals
that's the one of the first things pop

517
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:30,460
up window open because they just happen
you know you laughed her window and it's

518
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:35,950
either plastic or even if its like women
or something it only maybe like a

519
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:40,460
quarter of an inch since it is getting a
screwdriver hit really hard gonna pop

520
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:46,900
that you get stronger walks or if you
want to look like an old lady house who

521
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:50,890
really cared if somewhat enjoyable
sticking in there that way even if they

522
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:55,019
pop out well I mean there's a physical
thing that's keeping the winner from

523
00:59:55,019 --> 00:59:57,720
going up and down

524
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:02,078
landscaping can be a good attorney I
mean there's a lot of things you can do

525
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:06,700
just just the basic things that come on
your house

526
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:10,950
upgrade you are you can you can actually
upgrade your door frame so people can

527
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:15,259
bust through those there's a few cheap
options to actually strengthen your door

528
01:00:15,259 --> 01:00:28,930
frames your walks in and other things go
home security company about where things

529
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:39,450
upstairs like it has a multi-tiered
house the windows upstairs are often X

530
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:43,839
amount of sensors I can put it on that
more than you got your garage door with

531
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:48,190
achieve you know padlock on it and got a
letter in there

532
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:56,720
thanks for the latter yeah but he saw
the house if you've got that put it away

533
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:00,260
don't help them out use a hammer

534
01:01:18,109 --> 01:01:25,049
Tennessee requires to do like picking
you have to actually have a locksmith

535
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:30,000
license and I know certain states have
laws about actually owning and

536
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,480
purchasing walk pics so just check with
your stay here and if you're actually

537
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:39,420
part of a routine thing I always have
somebody on the team that has a

538
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:45,339
lockpicking license just because you get
access to this article

539
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:57,650
you know as far as your average bear
whatever including walking and stuff and

540
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:04,319
things against the mistake and the
crimes Sharesave never doing a grievous

541
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:12,599
i'd like the court jacking off I can you
but I've never actually had a brief as

542
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:16,230
far as I get it depends on what your

543
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:24,619
sometimes I'll give you have to play
like no it's not a weapon is just an

544
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:32,339
oddly shaped so yeah there are over time
here but if you guys have any questions
