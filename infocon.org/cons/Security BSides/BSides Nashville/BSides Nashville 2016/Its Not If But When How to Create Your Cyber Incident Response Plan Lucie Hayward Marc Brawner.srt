1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,190
alright alright awesome

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,019
good afternoon everybody I'm really
happy that you all make it here Saturday

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,670
afternoon when it's tough to be inside I
think with all the sunshine word and I

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,689
brought my friend or partner along with
me today and we're gonna talk two little

5
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:23,010
bit about cyber incident response
planning and we're also going to talk

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:31,949
through things that worked on especially
recently and open it up for questions we

7
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,530
go through this if you have any
questions please feel free to jump in

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:01:01,239
and just ask for seven years ago I guess
this year

9
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:46,399
things but there were also mark I
thought about consumers of security and

10
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,090
project management experience my claim
to fame as I were prepared and I spent a

11
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,819
good part of that in the security
department but I love well before reach

12
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:02,380
happened or even started sliding nothing
to do but I ended up here in Tennessee

13
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,920
because of my husband's job and about
sixty years my background of security

14
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,030
but I also have a background in project
manager decorated for the team I hope on

15
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,420
hardstyle due to breaches as a project
manager and i also help our clients with

16
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,470
what we're talking about today with
building up their cyber incident

17
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,049
response is hosting the tabletop
exercises and also president of the

18
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:31,430
National chapter this is my second year
as chapter president and I know our

19
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,350
annual symposium on a lot of effort goes
into putting on these types of things

20
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,420
they've done a great job here and please
make sure to thank all the volunteers

21
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:53,339
were giving up their time to put
together this about a week so plan your

22
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,600
organization people ok with it

23
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,500
so one of the things that we do with our
clients we come in and help them build

24
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,390
an incident response plan and we have
seen quite a wide variety of her plans

25
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,670
we were companies that have nothing
because they just haven't felt that they

26
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,799
needed it or they know where to start

27
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,260
weaver companies in every detail plans
and in some cases are a little too

28
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,040
details a little bit about that as we go
for it

29
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,440
response plan I love using the new stuff
and they're just the instructions and

30
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,880
procedures in an organization used to
identify respond to and mitigate the

31
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,049
effects of a cyber

32
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:46,190
I'm gonna spend some time talking about
but the identification here so I think

33
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,070
that's really the most important part is
being able to identify and know when you

34
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,459
have an incident invoke your plan

35
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:59,180
get your team together and start
responding and mitigating what it's not

36
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,090
is its not a checklist that's not a
prescriptive list of things to do

37
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,850
out we find a lot of companies promised
to help them put together a little chat

38
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:15,230
with you know markets are people you
work with you know the cases that i've

39
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,329
been involved in everything that you
know especially think we're seeing now

40
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:24,380
is not what we saw you and I'm sure
mister clinton calls in six months

41
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:30,460
completely different than what's out
there so you have to check it really you

42
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:38,919
in the position of not being able to do
things that are in trouble if they don't

43
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:47,870
live here so if your plans for ABC and
then you find out the source of your

44
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,760
investigation that while couple those
steps really don't do that can come back

45
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,830
to haunt you later

46
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:59,340
specially for reach becomes probably one
of the most

47
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,258
going to like what they were going to do
every 15 minutes

48
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:16,569
manager partly because I like everything
but you know they were 15 minutes were

49
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:20,960
gonna get it together a conference
bridge to join in 30 minutes we're going

50
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,859
to have this meeting in 45 minutes and
it's like mister first goes in the

51
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,979
litigation and they come back they will
you said you were gonna do this kind of

52
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,990
silly but those things happen if you
aren't careful

53
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:46,740
questions that were gonna talk quite
important to define an incident know

54
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:56,169
that it's important you have a
definition and the definition varies for

55
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:02,500
every organization based on your
industry stated that you have a somewhat

56
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,569
more businesses but it's really
important that you understand because

57
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:12,319
otherwise everything could be an answer
right and everything you need to

58
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,110
determine how you're going to find an
incidence how we're going to find an

59
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,289
event and how you're going to find a
breach and what's the difference between

60
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:29,509
the various things like reach

61
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:57,289
yeah we work with there's a lot we do a
lot of these incidents with to protect

62
00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:02,580
privileged and there's an attorney that
we work with everything even if you have

63
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,219
one general use the word reached its
just got such a bad connotation people

64
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:10,199
here the region they immediately since
you're in trouble

65
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:27,500
problems such as a reminder that the
definition of an incident says security

66
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:34,240
and Senate is a violation of computer
security policies acceptable use

67
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,430
policies or spirit security practice and
I think this is a good starting point

68
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:49,089
but what do you think it's missing if
you put this in your plan to do

69
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:56,529
everything right if you've got an
employee is using his computer to do

70
00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:00,509
some online gambling that's probably a
violation of your acceptable use policy

71
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:04,949
but it's not an incident you're not been
investigated or just told not to do it

72
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:05,449
anymore

73
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:08,500
morning

74
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:21,630
yeah we all have users so what we
remember their clients to come up with

75
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:34,640
what their definition of an incident we
recommend that you consider it was

76
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,380
something something like this but it has
the potential to lead to the following

77
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:45,820
either negative impact your reputation
inappropriate outsourced customer data

78
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:52,730
or loss of IP and it really depends on
what's important to you what would be

79
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,090
your worst nightmare

80
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,500
don't worry about how they got in your
network to some seventies and your

81
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,470
network and they have access to
something what would be the most

82
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:07,500
companies if you know getting hold of
our intellectual property or proprietary

83
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:17,250
tools for some companies healthcare
access to that there be bad reputation

84
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:29,280
about target I mean they suffered
financial losses but and some of our

85
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,319
clients we use put a list of all of that
has the potential to lead to any of

86
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:42,940
these things were going so far

87
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,730
ok so

88
00:09:51,950 --> 00:10:02,190
definition of any observable network
right so computer that's right

89
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:15,370
which has a negative consequence the
blood drive today

90
00:10:15,370 --> 00:11:35,790
execution so it's a little bit more
serious about their fire and also that

91
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:41,510
battle of the person I was just with a
client was last week during a tabletop

92
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:47,400
exercise and they call every about
cultural languages and other

93
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,390
documentation before then acknowledged

94
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:58,280
probably repeat incident so we've had a
couple of the couple organizations like

95
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,529
to recommend that they establish a
separate words prices

96
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:16,829
to reports however the industry standard
languages and talked about this a little

97
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:24,170
bit about using a brief word especially
when you're sending out emails

98
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,300
internally when you're conducting an
investigation

99
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:34,680
generally occurs control officer and you
know people like to throw the word

100
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:41,790
around three women have that were you
know you need just be careful but harder

101
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,079
referring to things especially in
writing

102
00:12:46,199 --> 00:13:29,449
talk to counsel so I can get great that
you are and ya know

103
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:38,829
yeah absolutely and I think having fun
and that's one of the things we'll talk

104
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:41,969
about a little bit will go through a
process flow of an incident and we

105
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,240
always recommend that you have and it
varies but we always recommend that you

106
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,670
have that one person who have that
authority and only that person

107
00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:03,420
components in your definition

108
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:09,089
need to figure out what makes sense for
your organization it's clearly state

109
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:10,529
that authority

110
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:18,490
a lot of counsel so we tried to work
with a lot of medium-sized companies

111
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,269
because they're the ones we generally
larger organizations have their own

112
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:38,389
department so they don't have a CIO but
you need to understand and it can be

113
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:45,079
your definition maybe we can as a
starting point I think it helps you

114
00:14:45,079 --> 00:15:06,410
focus on what you need to think about
when you reach yes and so when we work

115
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:13,040
with our customers we help them put
together some it varies based on your

116
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,110
company and your structure but it
generally works if you go very far

117
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,800
bottom there on the left you'll see a
number one there's a couple different

118
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,170
ways and incident can start out and it
always starts out as a badge right so

119
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:30,550
you might have helped us as they've got
a problem with their computers they call

120
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:36,769
me reported at the top you might have a
system alerts generated and it goes to

121
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:41,439
the information security team and they
reviewing or you may get a call from law

122
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:48,459
enforcement has anybody ever got my
calls the FBI or you might get a phone

123
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:51,550
call from law enforcement you may not
hear from a third party vendor

124
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:58,880
software that's been reached and they
feel the company but all three of those

125
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,330
will eventually slow response team
leader who is usually the sea so their

126
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:10,230
manager in information security and that
person will conduct an initial

127
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:15,170
investigations so sometimes it's pretty
obvious that you got something going on

128
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:19,959
based on an alert or the FBI calls
sometimes you need to do a little bit

129
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:48,839
more investigating the law what he does
and you need to resolve an investigation

130
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:59,520
what you have going on you may need to
notify more than incident there maybe

131
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,120
regulatory agencies that you need to
notify you may notify your insurance

132
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:15,849
carrier how many of you have a car
insurance policy that we need to notify

133
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:20,219
your insurance carrier and we recommend
wherever your organization handles your

134
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:26,459
insurance policy beyond that they'll do
not see your policy now no need to be

135
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:32,500
notified after carrier when you may need
to bring in third-party forensic so you

136
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,950
may need to call kroll we generally
recommend that

137
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:49,800
33 C capability capacity so does your
team have a capability may not depending

138
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,820
on what resources you have you have the
capacity and everybody has their data

139
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,720
right so something like this comes up
you gotta pull people out there did not

140
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:06,290
seem busy time of year you might not
have the resources available if it

141
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:38,659
involves an internal party if it's more
like for example you may need to notify

142
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:46,970
the media as well these are all ongoing
ongoing activities

143
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:58,760
remediation activities and then you have
any questions about this

144
00:19:22,240 --> 00:20:45,650
have a state paper prepare and be ready
to respond

145
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:25,749
to respond on social media on Facebook
don't post anything online that they're

146
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:30,230
gonna get from their friends family and
so you want to make sure they're helping

147
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,749
you put up a message out to the public
about it with their

148
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:57,710
ok so severity level you don't question
why they would want to establish the

149
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:05,470
12300 whatever known preacher they want
to use we recommend that you don't do

150
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,769
that because

151
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:11,100
incident it's all hands on that the team
together

152
00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:19,918
everybody's working to mitigate and
conducting what ends up happening if you

153
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,869
establish a severity level you might
miss label it

154
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:39,168
levels are just because you know it's
probably not a big deal but that one you

155
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:50,639
deserve it you're investigating her
computer one person but you know when

156
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:55,629
you start your investigation you don't
know all the other games will be brought

157
00:22:55,629 --> 00:22:59,178
in and there's like maybe one or two
machines and will start investigating

158
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:12,110
272 that so you may not know how better
how bad it's gonna be so don't worry

159
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:18,129
about it if it meets that definition
then you want are treated as a priority

160
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:30,129
whatever you want to have a power plant
is a real possibility definition should

161
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:42,160
identify everybody and all the naughty
marketing 8,000 employees involved you

162
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:47,260
want to make sure you've got a team so
that they can help employees rights I

163
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:52,800
was once working on an investigation
where an employee but they identified

164
00:23:52,800 --> 00:24:10,060
and actually this is also the UK where
they wanted to talk to this young man

165
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:14,740
because they are awesome

166
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:29,890
which was really unfortunate but you
also remember the rule of each member so

167
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:37,750
make those responsible for working with
perhaps if you've got a team of

168
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:45,540
investigators involved people were doing
analysis you know you have somebody in

169
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:52,680
terms of network now everybody
understands what their role and you

170
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,530
peter

171
00:24:54,530 --> 00:25:01,850
a single team so anytime you have all
these people are a core team and then

172
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:07,790
you add ad-hoc members because you may
not needed are you may not need

173
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:21,730
depending on what works for you and your
team members that we recommend you

174
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:32,760
consider definitely been investigating
resource researchers you're probably in

175
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,840
some cargo planes so network
infrastructure H R and then risk

176
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,730
management / insurance

177
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:54,430
your team know you know we've been
involved in investigations work seems

178
00:25:54,430 --> 00:26:03,390
like so many other things

179
00:26:25,309 --> 00:27:08,009
have a project manager wow it's really
helpful for us I will go with the team

180
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:13,360
we have a large-scale investigation and
I don't report it to a revolt that

181
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:20,459
provide us with a lot of Information Law
images and interview people get

182
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:27,149
background information about their 2001
start with the team and Burnet that I

183
00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:31,498
about it we walk into an investigation
and they've got a project manager o'mara

184
00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:36,399
things so much easier because that's the
point of contact who knows how to talk

185
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:50,119
to you then over to get that we don't
have that type of person in your

186
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:59,389
organization you know it's fine but it
definitely helps make things go to plan

187
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:04,969
for all communication process for
patients so you know who is allowed to

188
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,519
talk to the media was allowed to
communicate with your third party

189
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:12,399
vendors who said that the communication

190
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:31,760
you never know what can we go on
possible US Open 2012 guys in a congress

191
00:28:31,760 --> 00:29:47,880
where those initial nations so we know
that you know that

192
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:02,540
ok man just as the party's gonna talk
crime law enforcement regulators lot of

193
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:08,899
times as well go for powerful and that's
what we recommend oh and then have to

194
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:15,820
talk to the c-suite right a lot of times
they may not be there with you but they

195
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:21,520
want that daily updates updates gonna
look like you do that we recommend

196
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:32,730
generally once again today we had a
status call ready for a little bit

197
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:37,419
overkill and all of that takes every
time you have a status meeting gotta get

198
00:30:37,419 --> 00:31:05,860
ready for carrier update and that can
take away time yeah sometimes you know a

199
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,510
lot of times without me and I'll send
out a daily status reporter

200
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:12,669
opportunities and try to run
interference because one thing that we

201
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:18,450
can be very time consuming comes into
the war room and wants to sit there and

202
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:28,750
talk about these yeah yeah yeah so if
you know but yet you gotta have that

203
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:35,809
plan and you know certainly becomes
known her for definitely share it out

204
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:39,580
but don't have status reports having a
status

205
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:47,740
contact your financial also include
information about how to get a hold of

206
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:54,720
anybody not just medication but how to
get a hold of them at all so we

207
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,260
recommend include they're they're just
their cell phones personal email if you

208
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:20,070
can show you poorly because what we're
going to do anybody any also suggest

209
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:39,110
that you need to call once their
emergency contact information needed and

210
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:49,830
then we also suggest 2007 so if you get
a call or even if her phone you don't

211
00:32:49,830 --> 00:33:10,139
have the No

212
00:33:22,260 --> 00:34:01,700
we heard earlier make sure that you got
all the steps outlined in your process

213
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:08,929
starting with incident reporting down
internal status reports and then clearly

214
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:14,020
indicate when the team and make sure I
can security knows the plan their

215
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,770
familiar the plan and that you don't go
away

216
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:20,610
what are the things that we recommend
with our clients in terms of declaring

217
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:29,389
an incident in 24 hours and you probably
haven't put it to you probably

218
00:34:49,560 --> 00:35:31,600
actually this is what we knew they were
involved in that where we think that's a

219
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:48,130
really like and then testing a plan you
want to review and make any updates

220
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:40,580
there was where the right person or not
you know where this crater analysts like

221
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:47,470
they got there and everywhere

222
00:36:48,380 --> 00:37:00,890
so I don't wear

223
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:19,960
quarterly review make sure to contact
information is updated

224
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:26,549
roles change because he made her
restructuring and then test the planet

225
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:31,200
annually to identify any gaps among
other things that we were able to

226
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,080
exercise and will create scenarios
walking through the scenario was

227
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,390
absolutely something you can do yourself
a break in a professional to do it or

228
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:44,299
you know sit down taking a day and top
group A something happened what we do

229
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,590
everybody know what their role is
everybody know who to contact

230
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:56,410
what if it happens on the weekend we
know how to reach people able to

231
00:37:56,410 --> 00:38:02,670
exercise so it just helps you identify
the gaps plan and help from her

232
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:07,010
sometimes we work with customers who
when they come into the room to the

233
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:11,150
table top of the first time they've met
some of the people so a lot of times

234
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:19,090
you've got a regular basis H R doesn't
always work with so a lot of times up

235
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,560
the first time they're actually talking
and then it just helps you become

236
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,029
familiar with all the definitions the
process flow the decision-making

237
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:31,030
criteria and then by talking on a
regular basis

238
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:40,740
cybersecurity is incredibly dynamic and
so you need to be able to take that but

239
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:48,390
you have to know how to acquire it
almost intuitively ok so this is Marcus

240
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:56,200
gonna take over and we'll talk about
some yeah you know

241
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:11,038
just came out strong role so well

242
00:40:00,280 --> 00:41:29,980
so we might be there so socially they
are surely back so great

243
00:41:41,240 --> 00:42:22,000
we write differently and essentially
mirrors and they're just generates and

244
00:42:22,000 --> 00:43:17,280
so true but if they don't think so yeah
things as well as you know

245
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:48,790
we have a lot of things like that the
only thing we weren't so yeah yeah yeah

246
00:43:48,790 --> 00:45:14,170
yeah yeah I think that sometimes we're
here and there hasn't been having

247
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:20,100
another one that is going to help her

248
00:45:20,760 --> 00:46:41,920
there are stationed at risk aversion
stations per your working relationship I

249
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:54,910
think about your business so they want
to

250
00:46:57,319 --> 00:47:42,150
they're worried about their jobs across
its ok but they may take evidence that

251
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:50,799
you so my direct boss actually sort of
FBI you that we get evidence and

252
00:47:50,799 --> 00:47:54,199
sometimes with us for three to six
months before we get to it because

253
00:47:54,199 --> 00:48:46,309
something right here where we're at and
butter but about

254
00:48:48,680 --> 00:49:34,529
earlier texts the you may say look we're
thinking about what it right you know

255
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:48,050
where we meeting here or do ya

256
00:50:25,760 --> 00:51:26,150
earlier and then lessons learned one
thing we also rivals such as project

257
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:31,510
manager I love doing lessons learned a
little bit around if you really want to

258
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:35,260
be careful when you document your
muscles and incident because if the

259
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:39,090
incident was a direct result something
you should have done it or something

260
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:43,510
that you know about grass right where
you might want to put that in writing or

261
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:49,210
if you do darkening or do it at the
direction of counsel and how has the

262
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:56,690
only copy of it so because you don't
want a big investigation or a lot of

263
00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:01,120
attention and becomes public knowledge
and you don't want somebody to have a

264
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,710
document outlining

265
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:06,589
so

266
00:52:06,589 --> 00:52:26,380
learn here today

267
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:29,690
you know we're definitely answer any
questions you have a contact in both

268

we can anybody who wants them there's a

269
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:39,308
plan for distributing them herbicides or
not but if you live from Sydney to give

270
00:52:39,309 --> 00:53:27,479
you my card and I'll be happy to send
them out to you we went our separate

271
00:53:27,479 --> 00:53:31,618
ways

272
00:53:42,619 --> 00:54:14,200
going on that person's decision we need
to notify that is what we find in

273
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:20,999
organizations where we don't have a plan
but one starts talking something

274
00:54:20,999 --> 00:54:28,019
suspicious suspicious what would you do
a lot of them have not heard already in

275
00:54:28,019 --> 00:54:28,669
place

276
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:39,890
30 and 40 documents and so we just got a
more or understanding more people
