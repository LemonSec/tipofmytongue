1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,640
alright cool I guys get here is OK at
least an order to can hear me okay so

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:19,770
personal I guess so that's us as you can
see how we normally look good at all

3
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,948
messed up so messed up is working great
up until right now and that's how it

4
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:36,640
works right whatever anyway so months
and months ago he said the National hit

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,829
me up in there then they said hey babe
second is really popular website is this

6
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:48,010
Meetup up in the Chicagoland area and a
lot more meetups are springing up all

7
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,760
over the country and we would like you
to come down and talk about how to get a

8
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,349
successful meet up rolling because
clearly you might know a thing or two

9
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,870
about that and it was like let's do one
better I didn't want to just come down

10
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,048
here and go hey babe SEC is the best
thing ever and our framework is the

11
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:09,960
greatest way to success and the only way
and that's that anyone who disagrees

12
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:19,059
with me will fight you I said when I get
a bunch of thanks so when I get a bunch

13
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,710
of the people of different experiences
were also unsuccessful meet ups and we

14
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,689
can sit down here and you can watch us
fight about who's right and then make

15
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:31,529
your own decisions and so what we've got
going on here is enjoying Christmas

16
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:40,689
Chris Carlson the end and we are higher
ups in the burbs paradigm we we take

17
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:45,380
care of a lot of stuff that birds that
needs taken care of and Chris actually

18
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,320
has a lot of seniority on me by probably
about a year I get credited as founding

19
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,850
birds such a lot which is patently
untrue

20
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:58,869
I was somewhat late to the game a lot of
stuff for them Chris's think seniority

21
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:10,318
doesn't rate structures yeah yeah he's a
false modesty is like this I'm not

22
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,850
really in charge of anything it's a
brush the dust off the placard that

23
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,470
covers the vice president but don't
worry this is just for all just normal

24
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:26,069
people here I'm just more normal than
most and that's one of the best parts I

25
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:29,540
think the exact words there's not really
any leadership nobody's in charge it's

26
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,239
just a bunch of people who get things
taken care of and we'll talk about that

27
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:39,569
later I brought in case who does a lot
for my SEC but won't admit they're up in

28
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:44,130
Michigan they've got a couple of meetups
around the state and they're fairly

29
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,290
successful as well and they do things a
lot differently than birds SEC does and

30
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,170
so I wanted to bring her in so she could
be like that's done you should do it

31
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:57,940
this way and so that'll be cool to hear
from her and then Fletcher is from

32
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,950
Wisconsin and he's taking care of
getting still sick and mad SEC rolling

33
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:09,649
in Milwaukee and Madison or just working
with mad sector make things happen and

34
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:15,850
they're just starting out and a bumpy
ride at it but going well and so I

35
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,560
figured I could have a lot of growing
pains stories to share in things that

36
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,890
have worked in things that aren't
working and what they're trying so we've

37
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,029
got like the full gamut here like two
different two very different Meetups

38
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,829
that are working excellently in them
like the growing when it's getting

39
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:36,470
started to help you guys out in that is
us so what we're gonna do here is kinda

40
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,060
just talked about like I'm gonna walk to
the burbs sec for a more here's a brief

41
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,530
second and then everybody will tell each
other that they're wrong and then we can

42
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,400
all laugh and then we'll move on from
there

43
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,859
bird SEC is made up right now it's as
laura has 44 minutes when the

44
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,269
Chicagoland area

45
00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:00,989
prime North West and East Prime is the
first one and that one is

46
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:13,000
second biggest now the largest ever join
a group sex crime we get thirty 30 plus

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,519
people this was like taking on January
7th and this was just like who happened

48
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,798
to show up that day it's working really
well we get a lot of not only consistent

49
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:25,948
members but also I can't remember the
last time I came to one and we didn't

50
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:31,160
have at least one new member when one is
low I'd say two to three pages heard

51
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,400
about this coming in the most recent
meet up we started his brief SEC East

52
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,679
which is not in the birds at all it's in
the city and this was a picture from the

53
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,150
very first today and right out of the
gate we had we were hittin double digits

54
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:52,080
super easy and that's not accidental
we'd we plan a lot of the stuff out

55
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,469
advances a lot of work that goes in
ahead of time and once you've got

56
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:00,050
everything rolling and working
consistently it takes care of itself and

57
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,650
you pretty much don't have to do much if
any work anymore but up front you really

58
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,179
need to be dedicated to making this work
and that's the important part because

59
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,860
starting a meetup is but one of the most
demotivating things you can do because

60
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,590
you know me you and then won some dude
in sweatpants who doesn't even work in

61
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:24,820
InfoSec and you'll never want to come
back but you gotta stick it out so let's

62
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:31,520
let's start off with with the core of
what makes birds SEC work as an InfoSec

63
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,229
meet up in kind of how it's different
from a lot of other people's InfoSec

64
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:41,240
Meetups one of the big things we don't
do do we don't ask anyone for money ever

65
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:51,440
and we work around then I think they
understand that you might have to like

66
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,430
be renting a space somewhere and you
need money for that and maybe that's a

67
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:00,370
bad choices space don't ask people for
money people aren't interested in in

68
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,430
spending money at all ever had just
doesn't work

69
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,710
Issa

70
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:10,609
likes to likes to charge for membership
fees who's anybody member I hear ya I

71
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:16,500
speak once to twice a year and Issa
meetings in Chicago and they asked me

72
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,310
like how do we get the bird sick right
here what the hackers to come in we

73
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,840
don't have any engineers at all

74
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,039
BP's and see so like we want the boots
on the ground people in here and I tell

75
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,940
the very first thing I tell them every
single time is stop asking for money

76
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:35,460
that's that's a huge turnoff to spend
money to go here and hang out with a

77
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,159
bunch of suits when I can go hang out
with a bunch of people like me for free

78
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,100
the bar it's something that that you
know you're paying money you expect some

79
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,880
kind of return for everybody in and what
kind of meetings what you're expecting

80
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,390
this social interaction

81
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:54,469
you know any better fuel for his
community meeting new people paid people

82
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,180
to me johnnie

83
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:04,480
like it's it's it's hard enough right
now they shut the business down the

84
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,890
start up again motivated to leave your
house and go talk to a bunch of

85
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:12,169
strangers in and hope that something
good comes of it let alone having to pay

86
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,400
for that that's ridiculous nobody's
gonna go for that so just don't do that

87
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,919
know the things we do is we don't
require a shot with a Taser exploit so

88
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,420
happy that you created a lot of 2,600
troops and other likes serious hardcore

89
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,310
hacker groups do that with no day are
you can't be a member to do that it's

90
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,990
alienating we want people who maybe
aren't even in doing this but are

91
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,110
interested in it and wants a learner
looking to get into it that's who we

92
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:41,160
want to show up and share a house with
no I don't think any guys are doing that

93
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,630
right

94
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:47,380
required exploits we don't do
presentations that perhaps I don't like

95
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,420
the idea that those presentations
interrupt the flow of conversation

96
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,770
that's going on stopping the mingling to
have to watch something that maybe you

97
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:00,320
don't care about making the room be
quiet because somebody's talking we just

98
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:06,090
generally that it's done it's too formal
structured we really try to be like show

99
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:06,890
up

100
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,120
have a beer

101
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:14,130
or don't talk to some people who don't
and then go home and that's that's

102
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:19,080
pretty much all it is and so weird when
you doing presentations and things like

103
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,550
that you're mostly we're seeing this the
structure in this to rely on people that

104
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:30,830
I think is again alienating however my
SEC has come up with a good structure

105
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,429
for working presentations into the night
without interrupting things and making

106
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:36,400
your work

107
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:53,779
32 bits on that Jack's just twice on one
of those presentations but otherwise

108
00:08:53,779 --> 00:09:03,640
it's just social might bring her laptop
so just do all that and always seems to

109
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,500
get one knows where it goes

110
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,860
yeah that's critical

111
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,830
that's absolutely critical for your
Meetup same time and place every time so

112
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,779
that they can set a recurring thing in
their calendar and even if it comes up

113
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:23,200
and six months ago man I haven't been
there in a while if you go back they can

114
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,470
show up the same time the same place
unless something major has happened so

115
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:34,589
you do to a month and then the first one
is presentations second one staying out

116
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:38,640
of the bar pick locks enjoying it would

117
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:47,949
I would hope so and what are you guys
doing up there it's very similar no dues

118
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:55,800
relax social type of scenario to be at a
bar we are experimenting with a new

119
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,529
venues we do one downtown Milwaukee and
we do a suburban one alternate every

120
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:07,480
other that's in the past been very
successful people working lives are you

121
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,350
doing presentations you doing hanging
out what's your general it's been just

122
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:18,589
helping out we are toying around with
not necessarily presentations but more

123
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:22,709
like a quick round table 5 minutes just
talk about something maybe something

124
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:27,790
working on the ground to explain explain
how that goes with it was a good idea it

125
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:35,870
was an honest framework to agree but
it's just very quickly we were planning

126
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,579
on doing it

127
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:41,628
optional so if you're new mayor cheye
you know I feel it would work as a good

128
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:46,420
icebreaker perhaps if you are new or you
know you could discover common interests

129
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,899
yes so the deal was you just go around
and everybody takes five minutes is here

130
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,850
some cool I did it work you know this
week this month to pay off the meetup is

131
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,050
there some cool I was reading about
online or something I was just thinking

132
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,709
of starting to look into just like one
interesting thing that you did are

133
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:07,069
looking into that month to conduct get
everyone talking lube everybody up a

134
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:16,430
little bit get the conversation flowing
make I know you don't want to have an

135
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,550
option but still feel pressure readings

136
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:27,269
I'm just sure there is that like with
you when you doing the go around you

137
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,279
always have an anxiety of home and it's
coming to me it's coming to me it's

138
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,279
coming

139
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:39,249
say something dumb about drones pass I
mean that's right and so I think a big

140
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:43,920
takeaway from all of this is going to be
the worst answer I could give you as I

141
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,219
do whatever works for you and you're
gonna see that like it's it's working

142
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,819
well for them might not work too well in
other situations depends who's showing

143
00:11:52,819 --> 00:12:02,509
up in what they're really interested in
what they like and so don't talk so they

144
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:14,829
wanna say they'll take turns and go
through all those on Monday 15 minutes

145
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:23,219
and you guys have like a more formal
room for that 2011 will talk about rooms

146
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:30,029
in a bit sad presentations we don't we
don't allow sales pitches we mean sales

147
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:32,490
people are going to show up you can
handle business card out you can throw

148
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,319
down a sense about what you do at your
company but like we really want this to

149
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:41,059
be a place we can come unload after work
you don't like it if people have to deal

150
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:43,660
with these sales people these vendors on
the phone all day at work they're not

151
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,870
gonna wanna come to your meet up
afterwards that's half filled with sales

152
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:53,240
people who are going because that's my
target audience and we really had to put

153
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,600
a kibosh on then say no don't don't come
in he leaned into our people's not for

154
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,339
that it's so they can hang out with each
other and I understand some salespeople

155
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:04,670
in some vendors are are are one of us
for sure a lot of us are sales engineers

156
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:09,550
who work both sides of the fence and yet
you don't wanna go to enforce its rich

157
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:16,309
just trying to keep it you know he's
super non work related 9 industry just

158
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:20,550
hang out have a drink I don't want to
have to deal with the salesperson

159
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,979
talking my ear off with someone I don't
give a crap about so we got it real

160
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,319
compassion that but we do a lot sponsors
and specifically just refreshments boxes

161
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:33,300
if you was accompanied want to come and
pick up everybody's tab or by some

162
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,300
advertisers and in exchange will say hey

163
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,740
company acts thanks so much for the
refreshments will sign with weeded out

164
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,970
will give you that advertisement you're
welcome to show up in like I said and

165
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,670
your business card out through a
sentence down about what you do and if

166
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,469
somebody you know asks you for more
information for sure have that

167
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,329
conversation if you as a salesperson are
being solicited for more info go for it

168
00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:01,269
but but don't be leaning on our people
don't be throwing sales pitches that

169
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:05,399
people don't want to hear every now and
then we'll get a sponsor who wants to

170
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,970
just giving a five-minute presentation I
can I just 25 minutes just five minutes

171
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:17,709
sales pitch in the parking lot yeah go
for it but not in here that's a hard and

172
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:21,430
fast rule and they feel it works really
well it makes people want to come back

173
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:29,489
because you're still maintaining that
relaxed safe atmosphere its sales person

174
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,390
safe room or you know you're not gonna
get a pitch thrown at you and that works

175
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,589
really well but we do allow sponsors and
will throw the name around and that's

176
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:40,589
fine as long as they understand and
agree to the terms there

177
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:56,050
going right into where your Meetup
should let's talk about paying money ya

178
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,709
know it sure is like me who likes free

179
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:07,350
anybody Johanns ok nearly everybody yeah
but it's it's it's a fine line you when

180
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,180
your welcoming sponsors in the head a
little expectations and you need to make

181
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,199
sure that they understand and agree to
everything ahead of time so that nobody

182
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:29,020
can get mad later if it goes both ways
but but very little late work because we

183
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,480
don't need sponsors are not necessary
for the event to occur in it's important

184
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,240
to make sure that your event does not
require a single dollar to exist and so

185
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,460
we don't need sponsors if we know
somebody if we see somebody sponsoring

186
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,040
something else that were at sometimes
Chris Chris Eyre one of the other birds

187
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,290
ex-members of him up go haiti is one
sponsor birds sec we meet here and there

188
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,459
you can say yes or no and I don't care
either way and that's fine we're not

189
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:58,210
pushing for sponsors we don't need the
money but a lot of time lately we've

190
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:03,400
been getting hit up by its winter and
meetup.com gonna hate this company we do

191
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,890
whatever in your area like to sponsor a
night and that came from I think just

192
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:13,490
birds are becoming popular to the point
where vendors now are aware of it and so

193
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,640
they hit us up and so once you reach
that level of popularity largest are

194
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,740
trickling in and again whether or not
you want to even entertain the idea of

195
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,290
sponsors is totally your call and you
feel it out and make sure you're able to

196
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:29,579
handle it but we're definitely not we're
not people's doors and like a you know

197
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:35,210
give us some money to get people drunk
no we're not we're gonna come we're not

198
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,730
on Salesforce like just going down the
numbers calling the salespeople back all

199
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:45,300
the way do i do do that like when a
vendor or a recruiter calls me and

200
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,270
therefore local I'll hit em up 2 comes
up offering you a job I'm gonna try to

201
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:50,780
sell you

202
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,089
on coming out to my meet up and I'll
still come check it out and then

203
00:16:55,090 --> 00:17:01,430
something cool maybe sponsor it and it's
it's if you're looking for people to

204
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,490
recruit and I gotta have been going on
its full people who work in the industry

205

206
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,370
recruiter maybe we'll show up if your
phone then I'm never going to hear from

207
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,000
you

208
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,030
recruiters the same as salespeople you
gotta watch out you gonna make sure that

209
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:22,260
they understand they can't come in and
be pushy again no one's gonna come to a

210
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,589
meetup Meetup recruiters trained

211
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:30,110
jobs I don't want but yeah when
recruiters call me on the phone I go

212
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:35,840
have I got something for you what are
you doing Thursday come check this out I

213
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,060
promises gonna be thirty plus people
they're all working in the sector want

214
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:44,450
to I guess something what have you ever
talked to a recruiter the kind of creepy

215
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,860
you gotta play their game

216
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,860
hey man what you doin

217
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:22,160
you get a new phone fingers I got some
free Thursday and so bring on from there

218
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,620
the location is probably the biggest
thing everyone has problems with and why

219
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,459
lot of meetups to work out

220
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,690
you gotta have it a an area that has a
high population density in the first

221
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,270
place

222
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,889
statistically if you have more humans
you're gonna have more humans who work

223
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:45,159
in two sec or idea or want to and that's
like know your target demographic in

224
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:51,110
know where they're at your meet ups not
gonna just be InfoSec workers or even

225
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,908
just people who want to work in a sec

226
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:58,100
quickly the whole concept of information
security in a separate team for that is

227
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,219
disappearing he saw Mr Mann's talk was
it last year we talk about the complete

228
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:16,880
lack of a need for pen testing
manchester's on this yeah it's every job

229
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,020
and I T is quickly becoming security
those of you who work in a dedicated

230
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,450
security team know that a lot of your
remediation is just telling your windows

231
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:30,409
team your your UNIX team they go fix
these things that are a problem in your

232
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:37,110
environment and they're fixing and
they're learning security day by day and

233
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,689
it quickly just becoming a part of the
job InfoSec is everyone's job not just

234
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:46,870
some little security team was frantic
and ten years that that's going to go

235
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:58,428
away as usual but that's me so so you're
looking for like a high I T professional

236
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:01,950
dancer in the first place a lot of
people show up I just going to be

237
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,919
generally interested in security because
it's a part of their jobs and I T

238
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:11,159
professional so don't just look for in
people look for the I T people and a

239
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:14,840
good thing I learned a long time ago for
figuring out where the I T people live

240
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,490
is look where the tech stores get put up
I don't even know what a tech stories

241
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,480
anymore I think like fries and
Microcenter but the so few of those at

242
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,730
what are the comp USA is gone

243
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:29,400
like where you guys go for like
emergency tech gear when you need to

244
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:37,000
Amazon Best Buy next day shipping yeah I
guess looks like a totally invalid

245
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,480
option now though it's more of an
instruction like look for text doors and

246
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:49,530
like tell me where there were maybe open
a text or is the answer all this so they

247
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:53,080
used to be away if you let go because
those corporations do tons of research

248
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,460
to figure out where to build one look
for where the comp USA is used to be

249
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:08,610
looking for us just typing like
keyboards in the parking lot not

250
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:13,949
connected to anything and it so make
sure you meet up is central to wear

251
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,570
those people are not just like what's
convenient for you don't hosted at the

252
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:20,939
bar across the street from you are a
block down because you get to stumble

253
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:26,570
home at night you might live in an area
where nobody else hangs out where there

254
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:31,040
aren't any other I T prose which is why
our meetups not working because nobody

255
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,299
else lives there would be it's not
conducive to like nobody's gonna want to

256
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:41,190
travel 45 minutes to go to your meet up
after work or if you're doing it in a

257
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,919
week and weekends don't work too well
nobody wants to give up a weekend night

258
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:55,240
or day to to do it but yes we find work
weeknights work well I especially like

259
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,030
right after work cuz you can be working
to go to the meetup if if they go home

260
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,809
first it or not when you go home after
working on leaving the house again so

261
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:06,309
that the bird feeders there's four
different website gatherings in

262
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:12,899
Chicagoland theme park each one is is
located somewhere where there is there's

263
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,679
you noticed tech industry there's
corporate news corporation's they have

264
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,540
headquarters at least pops is there's a
fair amount of people doing work in that

265
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,980
area is also a certain amount of
residential

266
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,240
I mean the Schaumburg area outside of
Chicago where Burke said crime takes

267
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,350
place orders motorola's their zurich is
there is there a lot of corporations

268
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:37,149
right there are many people will come
over right after work at six o'clock you

269
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:43,880
know 530 people start showing up 334 we
have cigar second starts around noon

270
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,049
start showing up right after work and
this may do but there's also the people

271
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:54,860
who maybe work down in the city and the
east at like 330 text me where UN so

272
00:22:54,860 --> 00:23:01,389
it's fine but some people will will you
know when they go home

273
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:06,169
out to the suburbs and and have dinner
with the family 7:30 now I'm still gonna

274
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:12,520
head over to perhaps I could still going
on and it is a few like that ya know

275
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:19,820
West out in Naperville area there's
there and it's also people who work in

276
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,439
the downtown Chicago area that then
commute way out to the suburbs where

277
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,350
they live they come to the suburban meet
ups as well you know get off the train

278
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,899
had to the meetup and then go home or
yeah there are a few people who will go

279
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,929
home have dinner to family and then have
a pre-established like that's my burps I

280
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:41,040
can I get to get out for a while and so
like it doesn't have to be in the middle

281
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,629
of a Corporate Center

282
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,140
you don't have to do it where all the
corporations are you have to do it we're

283
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:51,280
all that I T people are and those tend
to intermingle but not necessarily and

284
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,570
that's that's the trick or two where the
people are dumb thing to say but there

285
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,500
it is magically figure out where
everyone is

286
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:05,900
do it right there yeah just do that when
i text or just set up like a fake one

287
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:13,170
and then be like full Jew it's a meetup
hunting blind blind eye set up like a

288
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:26,160
direct store and just up the old CompUSA
billboard with your training start

289
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:37,470
wandering up with Nick just drag on so
just do that just shoot people from a

290
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:57,760
billboard was taking notes and why is
that like why was it everything we

291
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:05,230
actually my office and just go
downstairs and it's doing it it's

292
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:15,520
terrible to everybody doesn't work you
know it is not easy I told you there's a

293
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:31,960
very they're very different from ours
did you get mostly people who work for

294
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,960
your company and its really accompanies
me up

295
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:47,389
it depends on your social events not in
your office though ok yes so you do like

296
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,440
the presentation wins in your office

297
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:56,460
and the social meetup is definitely
still not in the office and you just

298
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,419
lucked out but if you do you like doing
in your office you're obviously probably

299
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:02,740
in a tech center of the city

300
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:09,549
yeah so we're spoiled the traffic
beginning around all the different

301
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:15,690
places makes it practical that have four
different birds sex going on every month

302
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:20,259
right and it's it's really easy for us
coming from Chicago to be like I just do

303
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:25,179
whatever its fine there's a trillion
people wherever you go I wanted to town

304
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:28,720
that's why I wanted to bring other
people to be like what what did you guys

305
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,200
do because not all rights are you shut
up

306
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:40,059
kind of in-between . Milwaukee Wisconsin
it's a big enough metro area we have a

307
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:49,820
lot of issues such as marking the bigger
cities have obviously need for

308
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,080
everyone's

309
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,870
parking is an issue like if people gotta
spend money they're not going to come so

310
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,658
make sure there's enough free parking

311
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:12,440
kind of struggling with that we did try
one ban users of course

312
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:27,149
$20 $20 is population centers 1 to be
downtown for people that I don't work

313
00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:31,768
with you know some people or vice versa

314
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:40,029
back to menu with a success in the past
and there's a lot of its there's a lot

315
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:48,100
of suburban officers and also a lot of
people don't live in the city church

316
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,840
it's a huge change and get that don't
automatically don't automatically choose

317
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,280
downtown in your the city because a lot
of people don't

318
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:09,170
want to go with it parking issues
especially if I mean I know if I made

319
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:19,710
the trip down Chris Chris comes out to
burbs SEC East which is decidedly in the

320
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,830
city's very deep into the city comes out
at like noon sometimes to dodge traffic

321
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:31,179
and find parking and then his work from
the bar all day it's wrong but down for

322
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:36,630
that and for the suburban ones I'll do
the same ol commute out at like 11 eat

323
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,840
lunch in the burbs and just be there a
day working at the cigar lounge or

324
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,490
Starbucks all day in 26 starts but
that's where more dedicated and we have

325
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:50,910
jobs jobs jobs that sort of thing to
happen I can work from a borrowed a as

326
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:57,540
long as this one hour according to rate
this is a different result on your boss

327
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:04,480
to go to a bar at noon till 10 p.m. I'll
be working but generally like that at

328
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,870
that both of those meetups the people
especially in the city like it's mainly

329
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:12,719
people who live in the city and not just
wouldn't see but have access to the

330
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,660
exact mass transit line that dumps you
are right in front of the meetup is in

331
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,550
that was explicitly chosen the walk
across the street from the mass transit

332
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:27,950
line of Chicago nearest cities near
there if you had to get off to take a

333
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:34,130
train and then walked three blocks
people do it like no you dudes in June

334
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:39,100
maybe if I remember you exist like it's
gotta be you have to everybody's leaves

335
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,290
you have to play out for everybody's
laziness like what is it like if if you

336
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:48,129
could just roll like a log your way to
the meetup like how could we facilitate

337
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:48,710
that

338
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:53,480
for free and that's that's what I did it
on the blue line to get out and then

339
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:59,740
there's the bar you're done anything all
the way in the back of the watch and

340
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:04,039
still it's like anybody who doesn't live
or work off of that mass transit line

341
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:08,539
they still don't come usually it's
rarely get anyone who's no driver take a

342
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:12,370
couple of trains there they're only
gonna do what's easiest for them

343
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:19,729
your Christmas touching on an earlier
point as far as what night of the week

344
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:23,789
to have it Thursday civically worked out
well for us but I did want to point out

345
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:30,970
in Madison Wisconsin away from Milwaukee
they usually have Friday now if you have

346
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:35,940
if it's an area where people might be
driving 45 minutes when I go out there

347
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:45,059
it's about an hour traffic sometimes on
Friday night Thursday night I pretty

348
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:50,908
much whatever Friday night's people
could have come from all over cities are

349
00:30:50,909 --> 00:31:03,960
usually it's typical yes that works out
really well I don't know if it would

350
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:16,190
work out good night for that works out
very well last night was a nice that's

351
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:16,720
great

352
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,860
25 is green and I think that's another
thing is people a lot of people think 25

353
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:24,990
is not a great meet up because you still
coming to these cons with its two

354
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:30,159
hundred and fifty people just hanging
out on a saturday here 25 is excellent

355
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,419
that is if you get the trolley 25
consistent you're good you're successful

356
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:40,529
you don't have to go like once 25 people
start rolling in consistently you can

357
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:46,539
stay home forever in your debt you're
done and that's that's that's a good

358
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:52,049
point to talk about we're discussing how
do you define success as far as it goes

359
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:55,240
keep it up

360
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,830
she thought we're just implying numbers
like what when you hit 100 then you're

361
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:06,159
successful and say no because birds
second north has eight to 12 consistent

362
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,770
people and they are solid group they are
it's the same people all time they're

363
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,620
dedicated to come every month and they
love it and they love hanging out with

364
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:18,928
each other t-shirts made t-shirts had
like there are solid group and that's it

365
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:24,190
so it's not about numbers it's about
it's about t-shirt sale

366
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:31,360
yeah it's about rivalries with other
birds acts like it you know we have the

367
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,439
annual fight club but that's that's an
advanced topic we'll get to that it'll

368
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:44,370
be next year that I mean when we first
use words like up and figure out what

369
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:50,649
we're gonna do it Thursday because a lot
of bars and restaurants you know friday

370
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:55,620
saturday sunday is when they're making
their money and we want to have our

371
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:00,449
event at your location on friday night
we might roll in with like five people

372
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:08,860
might be fifty we can't really be sure
can you comment but if you went on sale

373
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,229
I can possibly bring a whole bunch of
people and when you're off nights and

374
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:18,030
everyone's gonna hang out for a while
and food or drinks missiles and makes

375
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,110
money at one of our one of our first
locations were really really started

376
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:26,570
doing it for a number of days they were
they give us it said he was $100 worth

377
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:31,450
of free appetizers every time we came in
and hot wings and stuff like that

378
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:36,590
because we're bringing people in 30
people consistently every month on you

379
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:44,270
know this Thursday when they weren't
authorized agency so you know about the

380
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,750
weekend on Thursday because

381
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:52,610
still come out and you not gonna be no
in this incredibly crowded bar lets you

382
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:55,520
know wants to get people in and out as
quickly as possible

383
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,920
gonna sit here and hang out there and
it's it's deep into the week like deep

384
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,810
into the week where you're kind of
pretty much done with work like you know

385
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:10,199
it rarely are you going into work Friday
like man gonna do tomorrow but you never

386
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:14,109
excited that Friday's coming excited
that Friday's almost over because it's

387
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:19,169
coming but so Thursday seems to be like
the night a lot of people are are able

388
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:22,779
to justify their own heads like yeah I'm
gonna get out it's been a rough week

389
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:28,550
today I'm gonna take it easy tomorrow
Thursday is a good nights like work

390
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:32,600
isn't bearing down any like Mondays you
just you're just depressed cuz it's

391
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:44,719
monday tuesday is when you like just I
guess if you doing presentations like

392
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,109
seats to me like Patch Tuesday like
that's when you're the most downtrodden

393
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:52,300
from work and don't feel like doing crap
you like now I am going home because

394

396
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,850

in like this is the day that we should

397
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:16,060

cuz I also like to attend the Chicago

398
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:21,390
2600 meeting I'm sure everyone is aware
the first Friday of every month and so

399
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:27,330
then I had to go and explain to my wife

400
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:31,730
on Thursday night by yourself and I'm
gonna go off and hang out these people

401
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:39,130
you don't know or care about that on
Friday I'm gonna do the same thing and

402
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:43,860
now is not a good what you've got the
kids to keep you company so you guys

403
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,190

american country that doesn't extradite

408
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:35,240

412
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,980
years there could be a lot different
things going on in them now I understand

413
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:13,819
the 3d print things that we've had also
people suggest there the company I work

414
00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:25,250
for me but that's another we want to
keep it neutral not only with from sales

415
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:36,060
people as well as kind of a public thing
coming out of the casual yeah and and so

416
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:40,220
as far as if you doing in the venue
where you want to provide libations

417
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:48,339
who'd you have to peeee your selections
have to be great hackers love beer

418
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:52,320
hackers love craft beer we're craft beer
nerds shut out the binary

419
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:59,470
works we're bringing some excellent beer
tonight thank you guys for that we love

420
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:03,069
craft beer wheel of bourbon with of
craft ribbon like we don't shut up about

421
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:06,240
it and so if you can find a place that
has a great selection of both of those

422
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,459
who make people happy if you have a
place that's like got you know your

423
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:31,310
three domestic beers it's gonna be a bad
time for everybody and see I like the

424
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:39,470
idea I like when people see other
people's stuff dies and then they're

425
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:49,160
just like well now I have to talk to
somebody got to work together there's a

426
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,790
prime we used to get a lot of people
until maybe eight and then they rapin up

427
00:38:53,790 --> 00:39:00,940
and then again whatever works treat
people with every people like enable

428
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,560
that and make it comfortable for them
and they all want to bring laptops and

429
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:09,110
work on stuff indeed outlets sure that
there's a place that is working on some

430
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:16,100
stuff on your laptop

431
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:30,400
it's great you gotta make sure it's
quiet enough for those things to go on

432
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,290
you know bars get especially as the
night goes on the keep increasing the

433
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:41,020
volume of the music the terrible
terrible music that so by 10 p.m. 9 p.m.

434
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,430
you just you're just screaming at
somebody about how bad your day at work

435
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:48,690
is having some mundane conversation he
realized the next day your horse because

436
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,870
you said nothing for two hours as loud
as you could

437
00:39:53,310 --> 00:40:04,590
order to bring a remote to have your
room full of five to thirty hackers be

438
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:08,710
able to deal with the situation but a
lot of them just the it's a it's a board

439
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:12,540
in the back and you can only sneak back
there so many times before they lock it

440
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:20,900
up before then they do well the kids
clothes because you kept unlocking it we

441
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,920
actually had to change of venue for
prime which is something terrible to do

442
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,580
like that is traumatizing for your
attendance with you switch venues cuz

443
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:34,350
you don't really have like a primary
means of contacting it you don't have a

444
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:37,630
phone listing you no one's gonna call
her and let you know we switch the venue

445
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:41,910
you're gonna lose some people when you
change and we just had a venue that got

446
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:44,580
so bad that used to be great

447
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:49,279
the used to love us that the staff was
amazing the staff was totally cool with

448
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:55,100
handling the fact that we can come in to
be like we might have five we might have

449
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:59,700
40 that's the best answer I can give you
are you cool with that

450
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,509
and usually we pick bars a lot because
bars are used to that bars deal with

451
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:09,590
randos showing up in and out and needing
separate checks separate texts critical

452
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:14,510
need a man don't do group checks because
that one webber's last is getting

453
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:19,210
screwed or you're spending 40 minutes
just figuring out who got what checks

454
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,370
are the worst so your place has to be
cool with randos chip punching in and

455
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:24,069
out all night

456
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:30,370
cool with tiny two huge groups randomly
and separate checks and we never had too

457
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:35,259
much trouble finding that but on
occasion you do they like no we do 11

458
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:41,410
check for table and sorry I will take
her forty people somewhere else and but

459
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:46,080
the staff was great fast efficient took
care of everybody who loved us love that

460
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,190
we came because we bought a bunch of
people and the staff is making great tip

461
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:53,930
money but then like they just started
changing event management chain manager

462
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,990
Sandy started doing that thing with the
cranking the music and they were

463
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:06,680
were short staffing us on Thursday as it
did and there was nobody there and then

464
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:13,390
it works yet you want to get rid of get
rid of a meetup just passive aggressive

465
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:19,049
angry about a year now we were telling
me please turn the music down we just

466
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,170
want to talk

467
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:29,350
yes not noticeably quieter and then next
month the same thing and eventually like

468
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:33,310
the cold shoulder

469
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:38,930
call me back ever every time I cholera
get that going message that's def

470
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,740
Leopard at full volume

471
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:45,770
all right you know when I'm done and
that's that's another key point work

472
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:51,030
work with the venue don't be some
parasite that the venue has to deal with

473
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:57,020
once a month or twice a month or
whatever you do work together you're

474
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:01,390
helping this venue out by bringing a lot
of people in their gonna help you out by

475
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:05,330
making sure that those people like
coming so they keep coming and it's very

476
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:09,259
symbiotic and you have to do that and it
just not willing to work with you

477
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,010
sometimes you gotta move

478
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:15,920
and it sucks sometimes even better place
which is really cold we are now in

479
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:24,400
arcade arcade that has my name cohen
it's a pilot restaurant where they have

480
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:31,030
arcade bowling alleys really really good
food decent beer and liquor selection

481
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:37,680
and management there how was it seven we
had problems with the particular server

482
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,410
and we had was just disappeared for 40
minutes online that management wants to

483
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:50,259
know at this point we get the same I
think the same wait staff every time and

484
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:56,300
so we are they know what to expect and
everything works out well but said that

485
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,530
we're like the work of birds that is
coming in like someone else to talk to

486
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:05,290
management someone has to like call this
restaurant trade and that's that's where

487
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:09,710
leadership comes into play and and and
you should limit your leadership in your

488
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:16,140
hierarchy to that like I'm a very big
fan of Anarchy nobody's in charge just

489
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:21,089
some people need to be points of contact
for outside sources say the sponsors

490
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:25,360
need someone to communicate with the the
general manager of the restaurant need

491
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:31,400
someone to check in with and talk to and
and someone on staff for your Meetup

492
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,280
needs to be able to call out to them hey
just a heads up we're expecting a larger

493
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,880
than normal group and that person can be
anybody it doesn't have to be used the

494
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,130
founder infected shouldn't just be used
the founders you gonna get overwhelmed

495
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:47,880
real quick it's it's usually just their
regular that's how I got involved I was

496
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,840
just a regular I was there every time
and they started kicking stuff to me

497
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:55,360
going when through barn Chris couldn't
show up there I just as johnnie zone

498
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,930
leaders have johnnie do it he said yeah
you do that I could tell the sponsor

499
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:02,669
where to go at what time because I know
that's all it is like this a lot of work

500
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:07,270
to it once you once you have a
consistent membership showing up every

501
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:10,340
month whether or not you're there you're
done

502
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,490
you're totally done you don't need to do
anything other than just keep the

503
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:17,779
advertising rolling in the notification
but there's not a lot of work involved

504
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:24,780
once you've got everything so it in
place just show up like I've I founded

505
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:31,880
birds SEC East and I probably missed
almost all of them this here and there's

506
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:37,610
been zero issues I just had to designate
somebody else because the guy I normally

507
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,550
do step could be there are others I
define a third guy and what they do is

508
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:43,990
the third guy who was always there all
the time and I called him you just

509
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:49,160
there's a sponsor tonight can you just
tell him the deal and because he's there

510
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:55,089
all the time you know is the dealio ok
and it's it's dead easy don't don't do

511
00:45:55,090 --> 00:46:02,680
hierarchies don't do manager don't do VP
of customer service director I'm sorry

512
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:40,169
she had received sounds techie I don't
know who make words up and feel

513
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,250
important that's fine

514
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:46,140
copyright on that here to hear it on
film great

515
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:55,310
workers were talking about hosting at a
bar in a type of venue you need for that

516
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:59,140
and you guys you're doing a bar things
working out for you where you guys at

517
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,330
what's with the ups and downs even
seeing what are the problems you've been

518
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:04,049
having

519
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:12,870
we decided to try to change the menu and
decide it's been mixed you decide that

520
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:19,680
bigger we decided last fall's to try
something different something bigger

521
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:29,919
table so we could but things were
noticing as I mentioned earlier the

522
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:36,040
parking situation the menu it's good as
a novelty but you've been there three or

523
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:41,840
four times I don't want any of us I
think that having a good man you are

524
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:47,610
coming from after work you know might be
very often I skipped lunch so starving

525
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:51,300
what they're going to get dinner and
they want an actual dinner

526
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:12,810
areas management talk to that in just
gonna bring anywhere from thirty people

527
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:33,930
once so maybe we could be more during
secret project and talk about other

528
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:44,730
people remembers it yeah I do that a lot
of Culebra the water people go hey you

529
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:47,490
gonna prime we'll talk about it a prime
you gonna be briefed said next week

530
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:51,589
let's just do it then but actually had a
great meet up place forward to working

531
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:55,210
on stuff outside of work like side
projects going to prime yeah alright

532
00:48:55,210 --> 00:49:01,050
cool deal with it prime so in a way to
trick people coming out to talk to me at

533
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:01,609
this thing

534
00:49:01,609 --> 00:49:06,828
going on also talked about just
advertising real quick cause I really

535
00:49:06,829 --> 00:49:10,109
want to do some Q&A and address specific
things that I think you guys are

536
00:49:10,109 --> 00:49:18,180
concerned with so pretty cut and dry
their twitter twitter is just that's

537
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:24,259
that's the best success we've had as far
as birds echoes at least whenever new

538
00:49:24,259 --> 00:49:27,329
people come in I always make sure to ask
them out here about this and do that

539
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:31,309
surveyor members figure out what's
working you need to talk to everybody

540
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:36,339
did you hear about us and almost always
they say Twitter what about you guys but

541
00:49:36,339 --> 00:49:46,819
mostly 20 we do have an email this much
to our site on the computer but how they

542
00:49:46,819 --> 00:49:48,319
find the site

543
00:49:48,319 --> 00:50:00,980
ok we did that come about to burn
November I think that's been very

544
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,980
successful we just got our fifty-member

545
00:50:05,989 --> 00:50:11,900
people are coming up are coming out so
there's a lot of people and I've been

546
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:16,450
looking at the members who have their
other groups exposing site you can see

547
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:22,149
that one of the murderous going they're
going to other technical developments or

548
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:29,650
special networking and other
extracurricular text of your head up

549
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:37,519
soon so a lot of things that a lot of us
are also meet up is definitely I yeah

550
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:41,999
we've we've been somewhat resistant to
it at percent but I tried it out for

551
00:50:41,999 --> 00:50:43,319
East

552
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:48,279
I would go to other companies like one
off Meetups like Groupon just did an

553
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:52,319
InfoSec night and I was talking to other
people there saying hey have you heard

554
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:55,830
about birds second pushing the birds
don't know what is that in

555
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:59,200
explain it a go and ask her about this
and they said I was unbeatable

556
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,379
consistently ozone meetup Meetup or
Eventbrite but usually meetup Meetup so

557
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:08,650
if you're in an area where people are
looking at meetup.com uninsured varies

558
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:13,690
by city but it seems you he's had
success Nesconset night great success in

559
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:18,350
Chicago soon as I put birds ickes on
meetup.com an explosion of new members

560
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:27,920
it was no no love for the rest of the
other cool thing about the burbs sector

561
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,780
network is they're all independently run
however their members think it should be

562
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:38,470
run like actually North likes to do
presentations even though officially

563
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:42,049
birds second doesn't doesn't do that but
that's what your people in a do go for

564
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:45,890
it I don't care if you guys want to go
and put Prime I meet up that's up to you

565
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:54,520
by this but running by 2020 it I'm just
saying a word for East done it's Jacob

566
00:51:54,520 --> 00:52:02,330
said he had tried it for West and
moderate success so it it's free for 250

567
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:10,830
members to try to hurt its gonna hurt I
great success with it the Madison they

568
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:23,360
sold just because a lot of interaction
is their Meetup sorry regular so that's

569
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,000
it

570
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,550
regularity is critical critical and then
most of the people I survey say they saw

571
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:36,830
us on Twitter so that's all I can say is
like Twitter's incredibly successful to

572
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:41,220
what do you guys do you just

573
00:52:42,260 --> 00:53:13,080
to a survey who knows wolf in a famous
person a famous person I append testers

574
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:17,779
and so we deal with a lot of clients
were effectively contractors and I'll

575
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:22,240
talk to my clients all the times he
check out babe sec and I'll tell him

576
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:27,129
like a rubber duckies to come hang out
you know sometimes I get them to sponsor

577
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:30,580
too so don't be afraid to talk to
customers new clients take what you can

578
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:34,830
get a particularly cool one like this is
really into it like this guy like his

579
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:37,830
team I really like what they're doing
they they would like to I think they

580
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:40,730
would like this Meetup telling check it
out

581
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:44,690
hang out outside of work to talk about
work talk about hacking engineering

582
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:52,480
whatever and then from there is word of
mouth gets you going so what's a few

583
00:53:52,480 --> 00:54:08,810
minutes so do some some some Q&A
threesome hands cool yeah ones that I

584
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:14,330
can think of and we were we are over
sponsored by the time I'm thinking about

585
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:19,160
having a prime a few weeks ago at the
strip club is one of the first times

586
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:24,940
that he had sponsored and and a certain
company came in and pretty much said God

587
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:30,020
just you know that I'm like sex like
couple hours of mine whatever you guys

588
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:33,950
want to drink this place had a lot of my
friends so we are buying the fifteen

589
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:42,770
dollar beers you know there's like she
may wait all day was the last time we

590
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:49,520
did it in a particular passion ministers
had fun tonight I didn't think I thank

591
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:54,360
you that companies I'm not need for
various reasons but that wasn't the best

592
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:59,600
move overall but yeah generally if you
maintain some level of professional air

593
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:03,230
about the place people keep themselves
in check because they're adults in the

594
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:07,390
professionals every now and then you're
gonna get a weird strangle Aaron but

595
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:15,799
it's rarely been a problem we have huge
groups Kate has a story apparently smile

596
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:41,850
question we just got a random crime and
when like full on a strip club guy is

597
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:47,730
like that guy but it was just that one
guy and you might be someone ard at the

598
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:50,740
bar was already been there drinking and
then sees a whole bunch of people and

599
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:54,339
like all they're getting free drinks I'm
gonna go hang out with that group

600
00:55:54,340 --> 00:56:01,710
sweatpants guy and I don't think we have
time for that story but its excellent

601
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:11,110
tell that some other time that was me
and pancakes those sweatpants guy I'm

602
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:14,150
gonna tell us stories real quick and
it's and I think it's critical to you

603
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:30,940
guys who are starting out and then you
can tell us so ya go that's up to you to

604
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:36,830
take on the situation and react properly
if sometimes it might be best to have

605
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:42,730
the if you're in a bar the bar staff
deal with it that's one of the one of

606
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:46,710
the benefits of being in a public places
you can go hey this guy's back here and

607
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:51,120
he's harassing everybody's is groping
women he's way too drunk you guys do

608
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:58,520
with him the bar staff is very equipped
to deal with situations like that if

609
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:02,930
he's just an undesirable individual he's
just being mean to people nobody likes

610
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:05,419
him

611
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:09,470
that is taken care off by itself is
people just stop talking about being

612
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:14,558
aggressive about it and aggressively
offensive if you're in a public place

613
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,049
you can generally get the staff to
handle that depending on how bad it is

614
00:57:18,049 --> 00:57:22,540
you might have to get the police
involved which is terrible but what do

615
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:45,170
you do when you call building security
like what's going wrong and how to get

616
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:55,849
the guy is the person who talks to
everybody like I would probably try and

617
00:57:55,849 --> 00:57:59,950
address the situation myself as I go to
talk to the guy about split was pulled

618
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:03,720
back a little or maybe I I throw myself
in the line of fire lot when I will at

619
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:07,200
least make myself the focus of whatever
the problem was and then hang out the

620
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:11,348
corner and that the guy yell at me for
two hours which I don't like is probably

621
00:58:11,349 --> 00:58:26,930
the worst but that's what I do so it's
it's great reason to get you get to know

622
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:31,919
your members because the social
situation and surprising that everyone

623
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:42,480
in in information security or ITT's is
socially adept it's an issue there

624
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:50,299
interact and someone is just annoyingly
annoying and some way you know it will

625
00:58:50,299 --> 00:58:55,319
be a confrontation with Frank like
you're saying have a good time nobody

626
00:58:55,319 --> 00:58:55,808
cares

627
00:58:55,809 --> 00:58:59,079
yeah it's the same thing you would do if
you're out with a bunch of friends when

628
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:00,600
I got too drunk to you

629
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,490
however you would deal with that and so
just try to know who's there if it's

630
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:09,640
some random and its first time you got
way too drunk dude you gotta do don't

631
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:36,080
escalate the situation also it's just
like an apple board member 20 address

632
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:40,090
the situation then have real people get
arguments all the time

633
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:44,069
heated arguments and they're fun I think
you're wrong about that

634
00:59:44,070 --> 01:00:06,730
security the security what is your duty
is fine and i wanna tell us the story is

635
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:07,190
it at

636
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:10,540
it's something we don't we didn't touch
on that things really important everyone

637
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:14,890
in years trying to start a meetup it's
gonna be slow-going at first and I think

638
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:18,150
that's why a lot of people stop and go
nobody is coming it's been two months

639
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:23,310
this is stupid I'm gonna stop doing this
when we first started birds SEC West our

640
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:29,250
guide Jacob said hey crimes a little far
for me to go to there's a huge tech

641
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:33,430
sector out here a lot of higher income
folks and thus I T pros live in the area

642
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:37,000
I man I'm gonna try starting up
something closer to here we started up

643
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,310
here is the Twitter out there and he got
the other group sex support select their

644
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:45,020
retweeting it to people who follow them
on Twitter they go oh cool that's close

645
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:49,740
to my house hopefully I'll go there and
so anyway like the first day first month

646
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:53,220
he does it he's there for a while and
nobody shows up by an hour in like sum

647
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:57,970
dude in sweatpants shows up like sweat
pants and a t-shirt in like sum ready

648
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:05,220
sneakers and a nice it's it's believed
in you realize you wouldn't wear

649
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,350
sweatpants too

650
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:13,670
it's also and I'm like I'm a big like
i've seen your costume there is no

651
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:24,040
formal yeah let's not call it a costume
yeah it's a it's my heritage and I'm

652
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,529
offended

653
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:32,380
cultural differences doesn't make you
better than me I'm sorry my apologies to

654
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:33,630
all the pins in the house

655
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:44,400
Johanns pimps let the record show people
here will start naming names i kno 3 you

656
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:50,850
and he looked like he probably hadn't
bathed in a while and he showed up and

657
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:54,710
and so Jacob stern talk to him like him
interested in like the guy doesn't work

658
01:01:54,710 --> 01:02:04,560
and I think we just didn't have was it
like working well with the situation

659
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:10,000
like this guy's deal was and it just
wasn't happening and he was weird and he

660
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,590
was just off and he stayed for a while
and then he just left and then Jacobs

661
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:17,630
there all by himself again but the guy
is like was there for the meet up and

662
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:22,900
had heard about it and then just was
weird and then Jacobs by himself and

663
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:27,810
then he went home and he decided the
next month to do it again

664
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:34,460
a bad experience in like one dude and
one weird own sweatpants showed up again

665
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:39,750
and the next month eight people showed
up just who'd heard it through word of

666
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:42,170
mouth and that was the first night I had
showed up and I thought he had been

667
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:45,530
going on for like a year this is I was
just getting involved in birds seconds

668
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:50,180
ago cool a whole nother group of people
and so you know a lot of it was their

669
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:53,790
first time to turn up cuz it was
everyone's first time and sweatpants guy

670
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:56,330
never showed up again ever

671
01:02:56,330 --> 01:03:02,790
we've never heard from him since but he
told people and so the moral is there

672
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:06,520
like don't shun sweatpants guy he's
apparently got friends

673
