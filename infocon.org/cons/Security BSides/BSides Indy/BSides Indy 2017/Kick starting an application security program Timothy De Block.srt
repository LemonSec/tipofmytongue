00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,270
kind of help people who are in similar

28
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,729
situations are looking for ideas how to

29
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,929
get involved in development<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifecycle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

30
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,220
little bit more

31
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,450
we're hearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a lot of people</font>

32
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,009
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to get the software</font>

33
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,090
development<font color="#CCCCCC"> lifecycle for a lot of this</font>

34
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:35,280
stuff just look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this talk is</font>

35
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,340
meant to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address that kind of</font>

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">help people what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have experience in</font>

39
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,229

40
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,169
successful in both my<font color="#CCCCCC"> athletic programs</font>

41
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:50,610
have been successful as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font>

42
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,530
finding is that other people already

43
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,970
doing this stuff and so this talk has

44
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,280
given them a little bit of confidence

45
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,530
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> for people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the consulting realm</font>

46
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,090
are you know they're looking to engage

47
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,009
with the development team a little bit

48
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,659
more this is I've talked to a couple

49
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,110
people who have found benefit this talk

50
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:10,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">so that's why this talk is so the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">time to really go into that stuff and</font>

60
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:30,060
the title<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kick-starting so this is</font>

this here because one of the first

things that you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a building</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an app</font>

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a known environment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've been there</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had is that I was wearing multiple</font>

hats

81
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,550
this is also a waterfall so it is from

82
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a security perspective</font>

security in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a little bit easier</font>

86
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:27,330
than some of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> methodologies</font>

87
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,739
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did with my first but I</font>

88
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">started my research and I used</font>

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're the first three results are from</font>

00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:50,790
something called<font color="#E5E5E5"> OS which is the open</font>

a massive<font color="#CCCCCC"> nonprofit open-source</font>

100
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,780
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> focused on application</font>

101
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,120
security you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get a lot of</font>

102
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,250
value out of this it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge base</font>

103
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,490
that has frameworks and it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

104
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:08,430
tools and this is where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i started with</font>

105
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:12,330
was a dynamic analyzer called that that

106
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:14,820
attack proxy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what we did was we we</font>

107
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,290
set this up as new applications and new

108
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,440
features were going out we were doing

109
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:21,600
dynamic analysis on the new stuff and

110
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,550
this dynamic analyst is where you can

111
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,650
proxy all your traffic from from your

112
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,200
computer to the application and interact

113
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:31,419
with it and

114
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:33,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's life-form I some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> longer talk to</font>

115
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,810
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> go into a little more the methodology</font>

116
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,969
but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was great about these tools</font>

117
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:40,090
it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> well documented</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can go to</font>

118
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,740
youtube you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read just</font>

119
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,090
the documentation itself and really get

120
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,880
started with it

121
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:48,849
the alternative<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> proxy is burp</font>

122
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,640
suite<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is the preferred application</font>

123
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">or the preferred dynamic analyzer for</font>

124
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,330
application security professionals<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

125
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,250
three hundred dollars a year for the pro

126
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,320
version there is a free version

127
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,120
the only difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> between free and and</font>

128
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,710
the paid version is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's throttled</font>

129
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,170
a little bit so that's best dynamic and

130
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:11,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">I just another tool is static analyzer</font>

131
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:12,910
static<font color="#CCCCCC"> analyzers allow you to scan code</font>

them how to use the tools that they're

happened we had reports of a security

might as well go ahead and take a look

to see if there are like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cross-site</font>

developers using this tool and this is

298
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,410
kind of where I had an epiphany and that

299
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,660
we want to improve the security mindset

300
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,939
of the development team<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's this</font>

301
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,829
concept of you know setting up an

about security<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

they're kind of getting it at the first

317
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:10,010
everyone a lot of time and money so that

318
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:15,589
was kind of my first journey<font color="#E5E5E5"> my next</font>

319
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:17,300
journey was a little bit different<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

320
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:21,290
moved to Nashville Tennessee to accept

the role as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was sitting with the dev</font>

team to build an application security

323
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:26,689
program from that was going to be my

324
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">soul</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's my advantage my</font>

325
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,480

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,219
learn the environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> so my first step</font>

327
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,870
is to understand the environment and

328
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,430
building an application security program

where to go and one thing about these is

338
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,040
that they're not really steps<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

345
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,240
really like you do this and then this

346

message they can all kind of merge

347
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:15,199
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> so my first step is to build a</font>

relationship and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I build a relationship</font>

349
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:20,089
because security can be very

00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:21,619
intimidating<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to humanize</font>

351
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:23,809
and get to know the developers

taking security from<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a you know</font>

408
00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:30,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">they'll start being more aware of that</font>

409
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know that's great that's what we</font>

410
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,350
want we want to be speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

411
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:34,850
want to be speaking up as much because

412
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,489
again we're bringing a lot of negativity

413
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,809
to their process and a lot more work so

414
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:40,519
if they can fix a lot of that stuff

415
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:43,309
themselves that's great and sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

416
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">think developers spit out like a whole</font>

417
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:47,118
thing on security and then right at the

418
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">end go but i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a security person you</font>

419
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:50,749
know that we want to start building

420
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:52,249
their confidence and security because a

421
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:55,459
lot of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't doing it pretty</font>

422
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:57,110
pretty well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you have to speak up</font>

423
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:59,388
<font color="#CCCCCC">dude in the form of a question what's</font>

424
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,790
the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're trying to solve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

425
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:04,160
you know why are we doing it this way

426
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,509
try to understand it<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus saying no we</font>

427
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,980
can't do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> this way I mean there might</font>

428
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:08,720
be certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> scenarios where that is but</font>

try to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the form of a question kind</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of start guiding them that way they</font>

431
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:15,679
respond a lot better that kind of stuff

432
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:18,559
the other thing is to inventory

433
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,269
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you can look</font>

434
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,009
up here and see that there's been some

00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:24,709
kind of security incident<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think even</font>

check to see if there's an issue

apache struts just came out last week

00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,269
might have to go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google or go to some</font>

463
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:22,569
other resources to figure out how to

secure these applications and this will

465
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:27,129
take a lot of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am I am still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

addressing things that they are working

477
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:58,240
on right now so you want to kind of you

want to start at what what what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now and when you have</font>

480

an opportunity to go back to stuff

481
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,399
already production you do that you can

482
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,880
also this is also an opportune time to

483
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:12,760
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> automation within the development</font>

484
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">lifecycle so there's a project called a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">las pipeline which deals with continuous</font>

487
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:23,860
the next step<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also you want to</font>

488
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,360
implement processes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sense a</font>

489
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,799
lot of my processes have been

490
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,240
implemented because the developers have

491
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,789
asked the question how do we handle this

492
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,260
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're supposed to be doing this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>
