1
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:13,019
people in the room and enjoying the

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:15,959
hallway track good<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so it's an</font>

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,660
honor to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> here as I don't actually</font>

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,560
consider myself a security expert I

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,359
consider myself a amateur who is like

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,560
deeply fascinated in early into thinking

7
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,449
about it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know though I do work in IT</font>

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:36,030
but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of like saying if</font>

9
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:38,309
you're a ham amateur radio operator a

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,390
ham that they're not an expert in how

11
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,410
radio works right so and I was kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,149
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> something along these lines</font>

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,440
they're all the things two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and</font>

14
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:52,920
I just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a quick correction</font>

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,500
so two years ago I was saying hey we

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,730
could split up<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin private keys by</font>

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,850
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> zor just like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> raid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 and Alex</font>

18
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,319
Webber points out to me okay well it's a

19
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,659
256-bit key and the way you're thinking

20
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,600
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is that everyone gets a third</font>

21
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,720
of that and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the search the rest</font>

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,839
but as Alex pointed out to me really the

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,650
effective key space in ecdsa is half of

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:23,040
that so you're really actually giving

25
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:26,430
everyone that much of the key in effect

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,720
and each party in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> scheme i</font>

27
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,780
presented two years ago actually only

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:35,100
has to search<font color="#CCCCCC"> 86 bits which is still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

29
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,650
lot but it's you know as much as I

30
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,320
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the thing is completely</font>

31
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,270
unnecessary because as Alex pointed out

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,089
to me there is a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more standardized</font>

33
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,729
way to do secret sharing so they're

34
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">shamir secret sharing with the math to</font>

35
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:54,210
make your head hurt and it turns out the

36
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bitcoin world has an even better</font>

37
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,210
solution for what I was showing and it's

38
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:04,619
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-established now they call</font>

39
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,360
it multi signature the idea being you

40
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,770
have let's say you out you're doing a

41
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">two of three scheme two out of three</font>

42
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,970
people have to sign well that's just

43
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,530
like a business check where it's two out

44
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,930
of three signatures

45
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,209
and this is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shamir</font>

46
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,120
secret sharing for Bitcoin because you

47
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:23,010
actually are generating the keys on each

48
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,040
person's individual machine you're not

49
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,200
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> having it the everything exists</font>

50
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,450
in one place at a single time alright so

51
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,649
that's the correction from two years ago

52
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:37,589
let's talk about what I'm here for today

53
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:39,980
so we want to authenticate the boot

54
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,830
process why is the boot process

55
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:47,340
important let's use full disk encryption

56
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:51,920
as an example of one that we care about

57
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:56,959
so full disk encryption is a misnomer

58
00:02:51,920 --> 00:03:00,839
you don't have the full disk encryption

59
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:03,120
your CPU can't read your mind as to what

60
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,430
the decryption keys are so you have to

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,600
have not encrypted at the front of the

62
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:12,390
drive bootstrap software that will do

63
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,049
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process of saying hey give me the</font>

64
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,609
passphrase so that I can decrypt this so

65
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:19,860
full disk encryption actually always<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

66
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:26,280
that little bit at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front that's not</font>

67
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:27,690
encrypted and canvas be modified so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

68
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,690
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the boot process to</font>

69
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:33,480
remember is that before we can load the

70
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,940
first part of the disk boot code you've

71
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,690
got an EEPROM in your PC system as well

72
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:43,829
and that's also unencrypted and so

73
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:46,260
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> the EEPROM and the unencrypted</font>

74
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,730
parts of your drive that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know they</font>

75
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,260
all are<font color="#E5E5E5"> your boot code that help you</font>

76
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:55,200
boot and yeah if they're modified it's

77
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,328
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be trouble and let's let's go</font>

78
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,060
over okay how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you attack full disk</font>

79
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:02,100
encryption we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

80
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,660
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the other ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that aren't</font>

81
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,220
relevant to today but they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

82
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,980
be in your heads and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of fun to</font>

83
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,790
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there's the classic</font>

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:25,469
entering the passphrase in these are not

89
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,350
that small compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we've</font>

90
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,880
learned

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NSA has developed through the</font>

93
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:38,020
the pass phrase itself you can do

94
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">passphrase cracking and this is the</font>

95
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:43,900
famous correct horse battery staple

96
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:46,060
cartoon and you know hey if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use for</font>

97
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,979
random words from the list of you know

98
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">eleven thousand words that are out there</font>

99
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,730
well then you get forty four bits of

100
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:54,610
entropy turns out when you ask human

101
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:57,430
beings to come up with four random words

102
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:01,030
the we're much more likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit in our</font>

103
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,230
brains a much smaller word list and even

104
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,299
if we're trying to not have any grammar

105
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:07,060
to it we may actually and they even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

106
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,570
password cracking techniques these days

00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,280

109
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,690
crack a pat you can still try to crack a

110
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,840

111
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,310
be pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to explain</font>

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,450
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> cold boot attacks are but you</font>

113
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,410
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> look them up that's very they're</font>

114
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:30,099
very interesting oh and finally this

115
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:32,020
brings me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the way of attacking full</font>

116
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:36,160
disk encryption that I'm interested in

117
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,659
if you can taint the boot code either

118
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,260
the part that's on the hard drive

119
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:44,620
unencrypted or the part that's in the

120
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:50,110
firmware<font color="#CCCCCC"> eeprom then you can have that</font>

121
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:51,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nasty such as log log the</font>

122
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,070
pass phrase that someone puts in for

123
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,849
their full disk encryption and then can

124
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,200
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> recovered later so I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

125
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:03,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the coolest way to attack full disk</font>

126
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,080
encryption but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't you know the</font>

127
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,290
world is trying to fight these kind of

128
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:11,620
attacks so there are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are okay of</font>

129
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:16,210
course countermeasures here i'm alluding

130
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:19,020
to what became a standard in<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows 8</font>

131
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:21,190
to get the microsoft certified sticker

132
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:26,049
hardware manufacturer had to implement

133
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:29,890
this which is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your your</font>

134
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:31,990

135
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:34,380
on the part that's on the hard drive and

136
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:37,479
so at least the hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive which is</font>

137
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,810
easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change at least you have the</font>

138
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:44,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong which is harder to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font>

139
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,550
validating that and they even actually

140
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">also then they try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually shut down</font>

141
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,900
right access to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ROM shortly after</font>

142
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,029
this part of the after early in the boot

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,020
process basically early<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it checks for</font>

144
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:58,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">updates after that rights are locked out</font>

145
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,520
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this doesn't protect you though from</font>

146
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:04,568
someone actually getting physical access

147
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:09,698
to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine and using a programmer</font>

148
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:12,430
to rewrite your ROM chip right so really

149
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:14,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is what people who are really</font>

serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> about boot time security have</font>

151
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:19,509
been doing for a long time super<font color="#CCCCCC"> a long</font>

152
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:22,419
time but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know i think it's been at</font>

153
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:25,120
least 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> years or more if you have on</font>

154
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:28,120
your bus a dedicated trip called a

155
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,509
trusted platform module this<font color="#E5E5E5"> dedicated</font>

156
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:36,009
chip is able to through the boss read

157
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:37,779
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ram and so it it can have its own</font>

158
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:41,080
keys you can have keys in the trusted

159
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:43,210
platform module and they can

160
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,729
cryptographically sign a message as to

161
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">the contents of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ram and then write</font>

162
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:51,370
that back and then so then your program

163
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:53,110
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can send that out to run to a remote</font>

164
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:56,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">system the remote system can check the</font>

165
00:07:53,110 --> 00:08:00,759
signature and you know the keys that the

166
00:07:56,379 --> 00:08:05,229
TPM is using to do signing are not kept

167
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:08,919
in ramp now how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you own a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PC</font>

168
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:11,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">that has a TPM you had some hands in the</font>

169
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,659
room the thing is they were they were

170
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:17,139
really sort of marketed as a no

171
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:20,490
corporate business thing and so they

172
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:22,270
didn't become super ubiquitous but

173
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,569
here's what is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to become</font>

174
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:30,818
<font color="#E5E5E5">ubiquitous particularly it is ubiquitous</font>

175
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:34,870
in the Intel world the Intel is putting

176
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:38,140
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a separate coprocessor in with their</font>

177
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:41,948
CPU packages called the management

178
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:46,120
engine and they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting a ton</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

179
00:08:41,948 --> 00:08:48,279
functionality into it it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

180
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,050
scope creep on it is kind of its kind of

181
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:52,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aegeus like early on people just knew</font>

182
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,469
about it for like okay well this

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,810
coprocessor it can

184
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,520
ooh remote management for powering the

185
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:01,349
machine on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and off but they're putting</font>

186
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,350
more and more things into it including

187
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:08,070
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting firmware verification in</font>

188
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:10,870
there putting drm in<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're putting</font>

189
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,090
their own implementation of a TPM so

190
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,470
that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a separate</font>

191
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:17,800
chip added to the board it all comes in

192
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:21,190
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU chip package and there's</font>

193
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,079
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a security perspective</font>

194
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,970
there's actually a you know you're

195
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,380
gaining some security features if you

196
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:31,180
have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these and you didn't have a</font>

197
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:33,070
TPM before but I I'd suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't</font>

198
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,930
want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it but follow this link</font>

199
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:38,500
and you can learn some really

200
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:43,120
interesting stuff and here's a simpler

201
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:45,100
link along the same lines so what I'm

202
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,950
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into is sort of a dumb and</font>

203
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:52,990
cheap alternative to having these

204
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:57,070
hardware based solutions so here's the

205
00:09:52,990 --> 00:10:01,600
idea you've got the pc you want to boot

206
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:03,940
and evaluate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the firmware on and the</font>

207
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,200
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you're not able to supervise it</font>

208
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,270
all the time you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to provide</font>

209
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,420
physical security that you can fully

210
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:12,400
rely on whereas you also have a second

211
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,110
mobile device that maybe you trust a lot

212
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,319
and you keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you all the time or</font>

213
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:19,960
you keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a safe or something so</font>

214
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:23,770
you hook the two together at boot time

215
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:26,020
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is the small portable</font>

216
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:28,270
device that you've been keeping care of

217
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:31,780
that you trust it's challenging it's

218
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:34,720
going to issue a challenge to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC and</font>

219
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:39,699
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm going to get you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do some</font>

220
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:41,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard work and if the if anything</font>

221
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,590
malicious is going on in the boot

222
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:46,420
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hoping that that malicious</font>

223
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:49,240
routine will actually cause the hard

224
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,910
work to take a little bit longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

225
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,770
can look at not just sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the the</font>

226
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:56,530
answer you return on the hard work the

227
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:59,350
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> output of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the function but I can</font>

228
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:02,370
also look at the timing to see well did

229
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,900
it did you actually compute it on time

230
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:07,160
so here's me sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stating that as a</font>

231
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,540
goal okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> wouldn't it be nice to develop</font>

232
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,819
practical proof-of-work challenge

233
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:13,040
algorithm with boot code and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge</font>

234
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:14,479
seed as inputs they will produce a

235
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">recognizable performance different and</font>

236
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,069
the hardware is unaltered but malicious

237
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:22,009
boot code is present and before I go any

238
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:24,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">further if this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a bad idea</font>

239
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:27,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you it probably is a bad idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

240
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:29,750
you're at all serious use a TPM but I

241
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:33,649
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is fun to explore</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

242
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:37,850
here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea in memory we've got the</font>

243
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:39,949
boot code so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ROM and the the first</font>

244
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,800
stages on the hard drive and this

245
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:48,740
includes actually our challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> program</font>

246
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:51,170
here and then the secondary device

247
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:54,589
that's issuing the challenge over some

248
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:56,389
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cable it gives a seed so that</font>

249
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:59,389
the challenge is unique every time that

250
00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:02,920
gets written to memory and then the idea

251
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:09,230
is we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fill the rest of memory</font>

252
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:12,319
with some hard to draw hard to drive

253
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:14,329
data that's derived from like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> boot</font>

254
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:16,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">and seeds so really big really big</font>

255
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:20,660
output of a hashing function basically

256
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:23,990
and by contrast if there's also a

257
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:26,449
malicious program present as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well and it</font>

258
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,130
notably it<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't overwrite the boot code</font>

259
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:33,529
because the boot code needs to be there

260
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:35,329
at least for read-only purposes to be to

261
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:36,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">be an input to this algorithmic</font>

262
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:39,410
challenge so the malicious boot code

263
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:43,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually has to take up a bit a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

264
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:46,850
your memory and the the vague idea here

265
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:48,529
is that if this challenge requires not

266
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,170
only passing<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the entire memory</font>

267
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:52,699
but making additional passes that feed

268
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,860
back into the algorithm things that

269
00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:56,769
happened at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning the malicious</font>

270
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,759
boot code is going to have a hard time

271
00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:04,459
because it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have the ram</font>

272
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:09,410
to work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to to compute</font>

273
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:11,000
all the outputs required so but there's

274
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,309
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad assumption underlying all</font>

275
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,920
of this we're assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attacker only</font>

276
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:17,839
is able to change the boot code to add

277
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,689
in their malicious boot code the

278
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,870
hardware<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to be unaltered</font>

279
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:25,460
and so in practice that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> act verifying</font>

280
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:28,130
your hardware is unaltered is actually

281
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:29,600
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard you would really want it if</font>

282
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,860
you were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this you would all</font>

283
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,870
you would not<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this as a</font>

284
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,580
means to verify mobile devices that are

285
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,280
a little compact and hard to take apart

286
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,930
and stuff you'd want it to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a big</font>

287
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,520
desktop case that you're popping the top

288
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,439
on and doing a really detailed

289
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,590
inspection on because if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is any</font>

290
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,210
malicious hardware change it's going to

291
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:50,390
it's going to be bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> news it's gonna</font>

292
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:52,580
it's going to wipe this out so you and

293
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:56,390
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's got to be a server that is</font>

294
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:59,300
meant to be on all the time and rarely

295
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:01,010
rebooted and it's also got to be a

296
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,319
server where you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> afford to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

297
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:06,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through a bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an arduous boot</font>

298
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,090
process as well so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some a</font>

299
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">German straits so actually when I see</font>

300
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,510
better be a desktop I mean better be

301
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:13,699
like a desktop style machine as a server

302
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:17,930
one that's really huge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can pop</font>

303
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:19,640
the case on the easiest attack on this

304
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,260
hardware wise is to just have a tiny

305
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,630
little transmitter that picks up what

306
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:26,330
the challenge is passes it off to a

307
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,890
faster computer running wherever and

308
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:32,930
then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't matter the performance</font>

309
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:35,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">of our you know we're going to be able</font>

310
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:37,640
to match the performance without

311
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:40,310
actually doing any work on the machine

312
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:46,400
we're testing at all so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

313
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:48,319
bad also you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have your machine</font>

314
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,689
you're doing this on maxed out on the

315
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,600
memory possible for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that board because</font>

316
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:57,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you haven't maxed it out an attacker</font>

317
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">can get around the fact that if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

318
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:03,440
your boot code thinks it's got to work

319
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:06,729
in in two gigabytes but you an attacker

320
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,870
has upgraded it to four well then that

321
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,690
the their memory is no longer

322
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:14,600
constrained and speed is an issue here

323
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:16,160
too so really you want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this</font>

324
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,080
you actually can't even use current

325
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hardware wear something new is going to</font>

326
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,680
come onto the market<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it anyway you</font>

327
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,720
got to use something<font color="#CCCCCC"> really old where</font>

328
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,060
your

329
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:30,079
you have the fastest and largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ram</font>

330
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:32,180
available for that board and the cost

331
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,699
for your attacker then becomes they have

332
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:37,160
to actually fabricate a hardware mod

333
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:38,209
that's you know if they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pop</font>

334
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,279
in a new chip they got actually

335
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:41,719
fabricated a chip for something old as

336
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,509
opposed to something<font color="#E5E5E5"> commercial</font>

337
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:47,420
off-the-shelf same for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU if the</font>

338
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:51,439
attacker can put in a faster cpu they

339
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:53,240
can defeat this as well so again you're

340
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:55,040
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to have the fastest cpu</font>

341
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,889
that was ever available for a given

342
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,050
socket and you're only going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font>

343
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:02,720
away attackers who can't fabricate a

344
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,269
newer one but at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> your do you have</font>

345
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,319
a defense against people who can buy

346
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:09,470
you'll go to ebay to get what the

347
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:11,209
fastest was and then of course

348
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:14,240
overclocking<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes into all of this as</font>

349
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:16,670
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be pretty much that</font>

350
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,490
this has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like your systems got to</font>

351
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,750
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> running basically as fast as is safe</font>

352
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,459
because an attack if an attacker

353
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,439
overclocks and they can get away with it

354
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:27,040
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have that extra they're</font>

355
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:30,889
going to the extra<font color="#CCCCCC"> cpu time they need to</font>

356
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:37,189
to get around this ah and you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

357
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:41,259
attack this with if you had something

358
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:44,089
hidden on your target board that

359
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:45,860
provided extra memory on the bus like

360
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:49,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so you've maxed out what the board</font>

361
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:51,019
knows for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ram but if you have if you</font>

362
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,600
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> something on the bus that provides</font>

363
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:56,660
extra ram<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they used to do this with</font>

364
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,970
really old computers<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they were they</font>

365
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have ram cards that would go in</font>

366
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,589
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're Isis slaughter your PCI slot</font>

367
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:05,720
and programs would write use that as

368
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:08,390
extra memory they would they would they

369
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,709
would page to it but it you know it

370
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,720
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot faster than paging to a</font>

371
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:14,689
hard drive so that kind of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

372
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,339
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to screw over alright so the</font>

373
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:20,390
algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tested for this is called</font>

374
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:24,889
cat chick and the paper<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really</font>

375
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:26,839
interesting and it's a it's a hashing

376
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,919
algorithm and they call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> particular</font>

377
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,200
class to help wishing I'll room they

378
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,299
call it a sponge function so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is</font>

379
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,409
that you you squeeze data into it and

380
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,149
you can squeeze data out and you can

381
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:37,520
squeeze data in and squeeze data out ed

382
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:39,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can just sort of keep going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that way</font>

383
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,990
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fancy diagram version of</font>

384
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,340
sponge function<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so i'm not going to</font>

385
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually explain the details of the</font>

386
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,560
Quecha calgar them<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't understand it</font>

387
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:51,050
myself but the pictures from<font color="#E5E5E5"> phipps 202</font>

388
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:54,050
it's catching it is notable for being

389
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:57,169
adopted as the Shah three standard so

390
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:58,879
the dot the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> government document that</font>

391
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:01,160
makes that official is called<font color="#CCCCCC"> phipps 202</font>

392
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,330
it's got some pretty diagrams sketch

393
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">expound of nice when you look at it in</font>

394
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:10,070
the pretty diagrams don't ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to</font>

395
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:14,720
explain this all right and then as a

396
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:17,780
side note<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time you invent a a new</font>

397
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,280
hashing algorithm you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> always count</font>

398
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,980
that someone will make a cryptocurrency

399
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:27,910
that uses that hashing algorithm so just

400
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:31,070
as a humorous aside this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the only</font>

401
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,810
slow in joke<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will do slide slow track</font>

402
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:35,000
conditions as their sloth going and

403
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:41,120
there's max coin and this is the

404
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:45,500
funniest<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think crypto map</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

405
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:50,689
other applications of ketchup so I did

406
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:54,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">some tests on this year laptop and for</font>

407
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:56,870
every chunk of memory I I tried with the

408
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:01,340
ketchup doing eight rounds which is kind

409
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:03,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">of close</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the the lower bounds for</font>

410
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:08,480
what they should recommend and then I

411
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:10,270
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and I tried out with the the</font>

412
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,590
24 rounds of standard in<font color="#E5E5E5"> sha three</font>

413
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:16,730
notably for this kind of application you

414
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:18,320
don't need to be as the requirements on

415
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:22,120
a hashing<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm aren't quite as high</font>

416
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:25,879
in so far as we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to prevent</font>

417
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,169
collision attacks we just want to have

418
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,160
an algorithm where at least there's no

419
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:33,680
shortcuts so there's some room to tweak

420
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:39,140
down the the rounds there but more

421
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:41,750
investigation needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so but yeah I</font>

422
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,550
notably in the end I actually had to use

423
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:49,880
some fairly small memory sizes to do

424
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:51,149
this the and I did lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of passes and</font>

425
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,229
lots of trial so

426
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:55,949
you know this thing was working hard a

427
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:57,749
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> nights ago and I think maybe this at</font>

428
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:02,549
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I tried it it's not really fast</font>

429
00:19:57,749 --> 00:20:05,820
enough at least I got consistency on the

430
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:09,330
second try first time I ran this I got

431
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:12,149
run times for full passes over 32

432
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:15,178
megabytes that were like two seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> 24</font>

433
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:18,330
seconds and this whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing rests on</font>

434
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:20,219
consistency of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the algorithm with the</font>

435
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,779
same length inputs but different inputs

436
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:24,539
doesn't actually have the same

437
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:28,109
performance time then you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

438
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:29,399
to be able to distinguish a legitimate

439
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:33,119
inputs that have a different runtime

440
00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:35,008
from legitimate inputs that have a

441
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,949
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> run time because there's extra</font>

442
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:40,019
malware using some of the resources and

443
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,580
slowing it down ok so this got all

444
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:43,049
chopped up<font color="#CCCCCC"> by my spreadsheet from these</font>

445
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:48,589
are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just flat bars</font>

446
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:48,589
but eventually I managed to get here a

447
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:55,769
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 plus or minus point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh three</font>

448
00:20:52,919 --> 00:21:00,029
milliseconds for most of the past is

449
00:20:55,769 --> 00:21:02,729
fitting within of the of the mean of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

450
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:07,320
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> runtime and I think the reason I</font>

451
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:10,679
had I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> way off the first time was my</font>

452
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,330
cpu was doing frequency scaling so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got</font>

453
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,099
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that after so that's another</font>

454
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,289
complication she'll string why this is

455
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:18,619
probably all<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very bad idea and then I</font>

456
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:21,389
started thinking about wait a second

457
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:22,859
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the malware is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say there in</font>

458
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:26,129
the red square and it has a bit of

459
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:30,749
working area in the blue squares does

460
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:31,978
this mean that it's when it does the

461
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:35,159
second pass through that it's going to

462
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:37,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a hard time you know it's it's</font>

463
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:38,779
going to have to throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> away some it's</font>

464
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:44,009
going to have to throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> away some of the</font>

465
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:46,440
computation and the answer is no I I'm

466
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:48,419
not prepared to present this too well so

467
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:52,109
talk to me after you understand why this

468
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:53,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a this is a major problem basically</font>

469
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:55,499
it's a chain of computation and you can

470
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,109
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to earlier points in the chain</font>

471
00:21:55,499 --> 00:22:02,999
to recompute things that you didn't

472
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:05,240
store and without much penalty so I

473
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:09,210
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a big problem</font>

474
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,640
maybe if you have more than just if you

475
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:13,460
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the challenge machine</font>

476
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,720
the little thing on the outside

477
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,850
constantly providing more see data maybe

478
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,470
you can mitigate this maybe not<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font>

479
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">these for the research is looking</font>

480
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:26,640
sketchy and the other way to attack this

481
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:28,380
is the you<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember I said you had to</font>

482
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,790
keep a copy of the original boot code

483
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,380
and you had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know and you got the</font>

484
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:33,659
malicious one well you could compress

485
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:36,960
the original boot code and then sort

486
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:40,020
decompress it when it's needed I think

487
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:44,070
it could I think it requires a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

488
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:45,480
then passes through overall you got to

489
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,159
pass through the memory over and over

490
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,260
and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again so that it has to</font>

491
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:53,880
decompress over and over and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

492
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:56,820
and then that will it'll take along I

493
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:01,980
think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> could take 250 passes to cause</font>

494
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:04,980
a point 0 for Millie<font color="#E5E5E5"> open-toe</font>

495
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:08,640
four-second delay to add up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like a</font>

496
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:13,290
second over over the course<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lots of</font>

497
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,660
passes so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be</font>

498
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:17,040
problematic so my conclusion is that I

499
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,620
have not demonstrated this to be

500
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,360
feasible but hey science we tried I'm

501
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:24,678
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take questions in the hallway</font>

502
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,678
track everyone have a good evening
