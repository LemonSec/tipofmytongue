1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,170
okay so it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very nice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here and</font>

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,219
on today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be talking about privacy</font>

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:10,349
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> data management so I understand this</font>

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a security conference but the talk is</font>

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,040
a little bit different so it's more

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,350
focused on the privacy and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular</font>

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,270
the data centric so databases and how to

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,490
share<font color="#CCCCCC"> data and things like that not</font>

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,609
privacy like tor and anonymous

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,799
communication from that aspect so we

11
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,109
basically have a lot of data we have

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,740
sensors data we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data we</font>

13
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:34,110
have facebook twitter email<font color="#CCCCCC"> rfid and</font>

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,570
lots of data and there are a number of

15
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,050
reason for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a data revolution we</font>

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:43,410
have bigger computers these days we have

17
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:46,410
small sensors that collect data about us

18
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,769
around us all the time we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a bigger</font>

19
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,620
storage and more bandwidth so we can now

20
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,989
integrate data we can analyze them we

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,760
can ask a lot of questions so these

22
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,089
things all these things we call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">data nowadays right so big data what can</font>

24
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:07,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do with this big data can help us to</font>

25
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:09,330
basically ask help us to answer a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

26
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,390
questions questions like for example

27
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,548
which treatment is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best one is one</font>

28
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,950
drug is better than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other one can we</font>

29
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,259
detect the onset of a disease earlier or

30
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,540
for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the case of communication</font>

31
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,330
and where people live where they work

32
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,880
how they communicate can we better

33
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,530
manage the infrastructure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,030
track how to manage the traffic better

35
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,250
with the existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> infrastructure for</font>

36
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,259
example social<font color="#E5E5E5"> network questions like</font>

37
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,570
how do people interact with each other

38
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,729
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these questions are great</font>

39
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,798
and we would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know them and data</font>

40
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">is definitely the power but there is a</font>

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">but here right and what is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that my</font>

42
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:51,329
problem is that Vega and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> privacy so</font>

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,429
all these data any<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization who is</font>

44
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,949
collecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> their eyes is our data right</font>

45
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:59,009
and any organization that<font color="#E5E5E5"> collects and</font>

46
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,719
share this data must take proper

47
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,939
measures to make sure that this data

48
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,869
doesn't leak out in a way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

49
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:09,060
compromises our privacy right and if you

50
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:12,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">look into the how the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> current system</font>

51
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,110
works is basically this

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,880
two things basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need a data</font>

53
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,830
center for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example and researchers near</font>

54
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,140
data set from a hospital to do cancer

55
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,270
research or whatever you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

56
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,190
and submit an application it will go

57
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,740
through the ethical<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bowl you wait for a</font>

58
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:31,790
long time you sign a legal contract and

59
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:34,910
so and so forth right our cake is that I

60
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,799
mean in one hand here there are two

61
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases here one is you have a lot of data</font>

62
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,880
big data and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a lot of</font>

63
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:44,869
research but at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the day this</font>

64
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:47,960
also hampers privacy and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do not do</font>

65
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:51,290
this balance properly then it can have

66
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">to two things can happen one is big data</font>

67
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:56,420
research can kill privacy or because of

68
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:59,030
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy reason we may not do big</font>

69
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:01,910
data research you see what I'm saying so

70
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:04,630
you either don't do any more big data

71
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:07,760
research because that hampers privacy or

72
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:10,130
you go on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you hamper privacy so</font>

73
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,140
how to get it right and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font>

74
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:14,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">we get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done then it will</font>

75
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,589
also facilitate big data research

76
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,450
because we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to wait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

77
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,280
long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there are people waiting</font>

78
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,018
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a long time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and sometimes they don't</font>

79
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,430
get data for doing research for doing

80
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:28,190
the research so what we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally what</font>

81
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,870
we do so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the current practice so</font>

82
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,579
let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a very easy to give</font>

83
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,950
you an example with that hospital

84
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:37,790
scenarios easy so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hospital</font>

85
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:40,880
has a data set<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so these are all</font>

86
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,890
patients let's say Bob Gary and so and

87
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,609
so forth to<font color="#CCCCCC"> each each record is our</font>

88
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:48,380
patients and now somebody showed up and

89
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,730
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a data set for for</font>

90
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">example when I do a classification</font>

91
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,920
analysis would like to know given the

92
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">history is that patient is more likely</font>

93
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">to develop a cancer or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not for example</font>

94
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:02,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so their normal practice is that</font>

95
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">chop out all the identifying attributes</font>

96
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,140
the attributes that reveals your

97
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,720
information right directly can identify

98
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:11,720
you for example in this case name or

99
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,090
phone number or email address or exact

100
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,149
address for example so if you remove

101
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:20,060
them it looks good right so now we can

102
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:22,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it what do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we can give</font>

103
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,710
this data sure yeah the data look

104
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">anonymous so that's basically that's the</font>

105
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,820
practice car

106
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:31,729
the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know even these</font>

107
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,520
attributes that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see job sex alien so</font>

108
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:36,380
and so forth even any particular info

109
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,870
it's not giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> any information but when</font>

110
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:43,729
you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> them together it reveals an</font>

111
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:45,850
identity how around<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2000 in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> united</font>

112
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:48,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">states in massachusetts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think an</font>

113
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,900
insurance company was gathering the

114
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,400
state employees all the records you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

115
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ancient combine</font>

116
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,948
knows what are the diseases and when you

117
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,330
claim for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the a bill and they are doing</font>

118
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:01,280
this exactly this thing they were

119
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,560
removing all the identifying information

120
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,080
like sin number and all these name and

121
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,840
etc and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> selling it to the other</font>

122
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,030
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving it for research</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and etc</font>

123
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,690
and one researcher privacy researcher

124
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:16,969
named lithonia swinging he realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

125
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,219
you can buy in<font color="#CCCCCC"> united states the border</font>

126
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,440
list you know the border list right and

127
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,780
it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause her i think twenty</font>

128
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,849
dollars in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that time and then in the</font>

129
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:31,460
border list you also have named you also

130
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:34,760
have job sex and age now if you join

131
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,820
them together here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

132
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,710
nothing lawyer<font color="#E5E5E5"> male HR da doesn't mean</font>

133
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,840
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you but in the border list</font>

134
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,219
you also have lawyer<font color="#CCCCCC"> male and also you</font>

135
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,979
have all the other thing where you live

136
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:48,349
who are you and etc so in that time she

137
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:50,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">was able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pinpoint the disease of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

138
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:53,690
governor of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that time for example okay</font>

139
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,039
so so even if looks very nice but

140
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:58,490
actually the data is not anonymous

141
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,889
because these are we call them adding a

142
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,810
quality<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier means that when you</font>

143
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:06,530
put them together it makes an individual

144
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:09,289
unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the take is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that even if</font>

145
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:12,109
removing only the identifiers<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share</font>

146
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:14,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of pseudo anonymous data</font>

147
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:18,289
is really not anonymous we need to do

148
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:21,169
much more so what we can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

149
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:23,840
before I what we can do let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you</font>

150
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:25,820
some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> example just to make this</font>

151
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">point clear that just removing</font>

152
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:32,210
identifying attribute is not enough in a

153
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:34,279
different setting in 2006 AOL<font color="#E5E5E5"> America</font>

154
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Online they had the search queries of</font>

155
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:38,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">their client for some reason which I do</font>

156
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">not know they decided to release</font>

157
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,679
some search queries of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers</font>

158
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,380
so what did he they chopped out the

159
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,120
identifying attributes meaning that they

160
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,940
are not going to tell you from which IP

161
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,860
these searches are coming we replaced by

162
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,719
a random number stood around no number

163
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,570
and then they release that maybe for

164
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,870
some data mining purposes and two days

165
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:02,389
later some journalists from the New York

166
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,090
Times they found out an individual so

167
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:07,100
let's do the experiment here together

168
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:10,489
these are the search of an individual

169
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:14,900
what do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is the age of</font>

170
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:19,010
that person you think 16 great it's a

171
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:23,570
male or a female female<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you get</font>

172
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:28,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are getting it right okay so um why</font>

173
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:32,030
she leaves<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think yeah and what's a</font>

174
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:37,190
family name you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you're getting it</font>

175
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:38,869
right sorry Arnold yeah I mean there are

176
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,340
guests as you can you can do them<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

177
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,710
know trial and error<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you'll get it</font>

178
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,020
right right so yeah so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so when</font>

179
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,090
you when you go to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> place there is a</font>

180
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,460
lady the family name will tell you I'm

181
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:52,640
more much more and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there</font>

182
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">is only 160 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old female so that's</font>

183
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the lady and then they're not in the</font>

184
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,159
door and these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> your searches she</font>

185
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,110
said yeah these are nobody should know I

186
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,050
mean she was embarrassed okay and then

187
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:06,289
you know CTO<font color="#E5E5E5"> resigned to imply fire</font>

188
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:08,289
there is a lawsuit pending and then they

189
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:10,849
became the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one out one of the dumbest</font>

190
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:12,860
moment in the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you don't</font>

191
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:15,200
want to mess up<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that so removing</font>

192
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,880
again the identifying attribute is not

193
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,719
enough to share data<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't share</font>

194
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,760
data like that there are other scenarios

195
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,370
for example the netflix challenge do you

196
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,590
remember and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that any of you</font>

197
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:30,560
okay netflix they release the movie

198
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:33,500
names so they remove the clients

199
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,799
information name address or whatever and

200
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,809
they say okay a<font color="#E5E5E5"> client number one saw</font>

201
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,549
these movies for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and they</font>

202
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:43,699
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just they're releasing</font>

203
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:46,550
this data to build a recommendation

204
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,440
system so they throw a challenge that ok

205
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,270
build us a recommendation system if I

206
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,140
saw these these movies which one I

207
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,490
should see right

208
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,260
so they wanted people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

209
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,480
recommendation system and to give some

210
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:00,390
data they gave us out of data and some

211
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,070
of the individuals<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are identified so</font>

212
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:05,730
that's very embarrassing which movies I

213
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:08,460
so I don't want to tell anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

214
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:10,530
to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the whole scenario and if I</font>

215
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,930
abstract it there are three parties

216
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,880
basically one is the individuals you

217
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,859
have the data owner data publisher and

218
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,080
the recipient let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hospital</font>

219
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,300
scenario these are the patient you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

220
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,250
the hospital who get the data and they

221
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,660
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give it to the researchers</font>

222
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,610
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example for cancer studies or</font>

223
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,010
whatever study when I do these are the

224
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:31,590
client Netflix get the all the movie

225
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:34,050
rent income movie ray yours all the

226
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,850
movies you<font color="#E5E5E5"> sir watched and then may</font>

227
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,670
wanna give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the recipient</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you build</font>

228
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,590
a recommendation system maybe you are a

229
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:43,229
grocery store you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

230
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:45,450
your whether your client is buying milk

231
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,940
and egg all the time and should I put

232
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,170
them together in the same shell again

233
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,180
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem so whatever</font>

234
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,699
organization you take it's a big data

235
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,800
time so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are clients and then you</font>

236
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,420
have a data owner and these data owners

237
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,430
would like to maybe the advertisement

238
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,380
purposes may be other purposes would

239
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,079
like to share this data with advertiser

240
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:07,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party researchers etc etc okay so</font>

241
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,980
the question is how do we anonymize the

242
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,949
raw data so that these bad guys good

243
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:17,700
guys do not rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> denti</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phi an individual</font>

244
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:20,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the problem is clear that's the</font>

245
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,650
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i only told you that</font>

246
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,270
just removing the identifier doesn't

247
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:27,620
work at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> i gave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two three</font>

248
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:30,960
examples already so what we can do oh

249
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:33,360
yeah so so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to fix</font>

250
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,970
their three things so first we have to

251
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,980
decide what is privacy right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

252
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,410
would like to preserve the privacy of

253
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,420
the raw<font color="#CCCCCC"> data so we need to have a some</font>

254
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,610
kind of model to make sure that we

255
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:49,050
really preserve the privacy well the

256
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:52,590
second thing is anonymization algorithm

257
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:54,180
so we have a privacy with we settle<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

258
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:56,130
with the privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> we say this is privacy</font>

259
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,319
we want to make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a raw data</font>

260
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,960
then I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> anonymizer so this is more</font>

261
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,630
of an algorithm and of course these guys

262
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,580
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something so of course</font>

263
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I will destroy that</font>

264
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,470
data

265
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,940
then it doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sense because</font>

266
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,290
you will not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use anything so</font>

267
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to also make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

268
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,160
to do a cancer study so you have to

269
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,690
preserve information so taking this

270
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,730
treating so it's an optimization problem

271
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:21,610
in one way I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> preserve the</font>

272
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:23,830
privacy I have some utility up that for

273
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,900
the recipient<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I've also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

274
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:28,600
an clever<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad on imaging algorithm that</font>

275
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:31,930
will somehow balance both the sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

276
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,330
with that let's go further so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

277
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:36,760
a number of privacy model and it's just

278
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:38,980
I'm taking this opportunity to let you

279
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,200
know so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not my work or something</font>

280
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,450
is already in the literature so it's a

281
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,820
good sorry for for this new audience I

282
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:48,010
thing for security community so i'll

283
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,050
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the key anonymity it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an l</font>

284
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">drivers CD key closeness and if the time</font>

285
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">permits i'll go to differential privacy</font>

286
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:57,790
these three<font color="#CCCCCC"> are kind of like a chainsaw</font>

287
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,830
you'll see and it's a bit different kind

288
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:03,939
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a trendy thing</font>

289
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:07,900
are currently let's go start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that k</font>

290
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:11,020
anonymity so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i showed you that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

291
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:13,810
in the beginning that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just removing the</font>

292
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,870
name doesn't work remember so job sex

293
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:18,670
age and I could basically find out link

294
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,070
and individual with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help of an</font>

295
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:23,620
external information that is the voter

296
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,980
list in that case so what I can do the

297
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,870
idea is very simple rather than just

298
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:31,390
releasing this raw table why don't we

299
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:33,610
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> generalize a bit what i mean by</font>

300
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,680
generalized meaning that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all rather than</font>

301
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:39,130
saying age 36 why don't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> i say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

302
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,620
age is between 36 to 40 right she'll

303
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,689
chew stream true but i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving it less</font>

304
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,000
information rather than saying is the

305
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:49,060
engineer lawyer let's generalize it to

306
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,280
professional right rather than oh yeah i

307
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:54,189
hear i can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can just say</font>

308
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,530
that knows if I don't want to release

309
00:12:54,190 --> 00:13:00,400
the male or female<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can just chop that</font>

310
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:03,640
column out any point is that now if you

311
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:07,500
look at the table here these<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

312
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:10,270
records are completely similar right and

313
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,250
these four records the green ones are

314
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:16,150
all similar because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I generalize the</font>

315
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:19,130
information so still the each an

316
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:22,010
individual record a true but I'm giving

317
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:24,020
the recipient less information now if

318
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:26,090
you use the voter lists technique that

319
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,890
when i showed you before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will not be</font>

320
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:30,980
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pinpoint any particular record</font>

321
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:33,439
anymore right so sort of privacy is

322
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,430
there at the cost of some utility

323
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,680
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am giving you a less</font>

324
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,930
information so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first idea is</font>

325
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,910
called k anonymity the idea is you want

326
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:44,359
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them a group and each group</font>

327
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:46,610
should contain key records<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay k</font>

328
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,470
similar records that will make you can

329
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:50,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">animas so if you if you're five</font>

330
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:52,160
anonymous that means you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

331
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:55,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that table you give</font>

332
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:59,260
out every five records are similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

333
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:01,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you will not be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pinpoint</font>

334
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:04,460
more than narrow you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> narrow it down</font>

335
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:08,060
less than five records okay so that will

336
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:12,260
give you some privacy any questions no

337
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:16,040
okay so is it good are we happy we use

338
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:18,020
this our technique yeah no problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

339
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,959
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems otherwise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we were out of</font>

340
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:24,770
job<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there are problems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what is</font>

341
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:29,210
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem here okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can you name it is</font>

342
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:30,439
nice very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea but you CD there</font>

343
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,960
are two problems let me show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

344
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,450
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem the first problem is a</font>

345
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,040
homogeneity attack what is the

346
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:40,400
homogeneity attract let's say I know a

347
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,699
bob who zip code is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that</font>

348
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,439
he's aged this and I got at this table

349
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,240
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I realized that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he is in</font>

350
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,840
the first three one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the three guys</font>

351
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,310
right because I I don't know which one

352
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,500
is this now because it's a can and you

353
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,939
must table I know only it's in this

354
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">group but look what is the problem here</font>

355
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:05,720
it's a homogeneity attack what does it

356
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:09,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean everybody has heart disease I don't</font>

357
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:13,060
care whoever he is he got a heart

358
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:16,760
disease right I got it so if your

359
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:19,130
algorithm is like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> its speed out and</font>

360
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,180
information like this though all the

361
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:24,590
records within a group has the same

362
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:28,239
disease or sensitive attribute then it

363
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:30,770
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work the second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is</font>

364
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,700
background knowledge attack background

365
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:35,819
knowledge attack is a little bit more

366
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:38,250
july's the way it works is that lets say

367
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:41,940
i have a neighbor Carl and I realized

368
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:44,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he is one of the tree here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

369
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,040
don't know which<font color="#E5E5E5"> one but one of the tree</font>

370
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,989
and I know that from his background that

371
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,750
he's family and doesn't have any heart

372
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:53,820
disease he's from he will eat well and

373
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,290
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know from sub part of the</font>

374
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,660
world who doesn't have any heart disease

375
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:00,750
so he cannot have heart disease so he

376
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,860
must have cancer make sense so if you

377
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,250
have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of background</font>

378
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:07,380
information about<font color="#CCCCCC"> your big victim that</font>

379
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,480
one you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify then it doesn't</font>

380
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:13,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">work it simply doesn't work an animus</font>

381
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:16,080
table so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's a problem we are</font>

382
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,980
not happy so what do we do the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

383
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:23,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> El diversity let me check my time</font>

384
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:25,410
yeah so elder I ever see so L diversity

385
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:29,310
idea is very very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple what is</font>

386
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:31,740
the idea here idea when I break down the

387
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:33,540
table into couple of groups within each

388
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,390
group I have to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure there are</font>

389
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,160
diverse values you remember here all our

390
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:41,010
heart disease and only two and I know

391
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,020
one of them right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> rather</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than doing</font>

392
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:45,650
that if i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure there r l</font>

393
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:48,240
different values here within each group

394
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:50,130
then hopefully the attacker will not be

395
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,250
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pinpoint or know the sensitive</font>

396
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:55,500
attitude of my victim make sense that's

397
00:16:53,250 --> 00:17:00,240
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> l diversity idea very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple</font>

398
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:05,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea any questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok let's move move</font>

399
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,030
at any problem with the lever citizen

400
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:11,579
happy let's finish the work talk and<font color="#E5E5E5"> l</font>

401
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:14,190
diversity let's go and no there are

402
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:16,079
still problem we're not happy what is

403
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,880
that problem here let's see what is the

404
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,790
problem if I give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> this data set what</font>

405
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,640
is the problem here let's show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a</font>

406
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,199
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> we always find problem right we</font>

407
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,050
would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find problems so</font>

408
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,110
similarity attack look these three

409
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:34,500
values are different right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a</font>

410
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:37,050
bob he is this I realized that he's one

411
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,300
of one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them here and he that these</font>

412
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:45,210
values are now different so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

413
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:46,680
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> than here yeah he um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so his</font>

414
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,650
salary I know he doesn't hurt that

415
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,980
much and second is he has a stomach

416
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,780
related disease<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so even your values</font>

417
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,340
are divers if you don't take into

418
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,139
consideration what sort of values

419
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,209
they're putting together then it doesn't

420
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,210
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> very well because it's revealing</font>

421
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:05,550
that he said his salary is maximum 40k I

422
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:07,230
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

423
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,120
figures<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside so that you do not really</font>

424
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">do not know what is a salary and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

425
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,110
know that he has a stomach related

426
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:16,770
disease all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> went stomach related</font>

427
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:18,209
disease okay so so that's a problem of<font color="#CCCCCC"> l</font>

428
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,879
diversity and there are other problems

429
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,560
if you see it l diversity means that you

430
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,960
have two in each group you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

431
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">L diverse values so let's say two divers</font>

432
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,100
diversity what does to diversity means

433
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,750
in each group I should have at least two

434
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,929
different values sensitive values right

435
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:37,170
so now let's think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about our table where</font>

436
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:38,460
you have HIV patients for example and of

437
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,860
course there is only one person of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

438
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,380
population let's HIV positive and the 99

439
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,750
person is negative for example and if

440
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:50,490
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that if I give you two</font>

441
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:52,890
classes in one<font color="#E5E5E5"> class that 49 people are</font>

442
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:54,420
HIV positive and one negative let's say

443
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:59,370
I mean he doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the other 14</font>

444
00:18:54,420 --> 00:19:02,330
people do and the other 11<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one one</font>

445
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,820
individual has HIV<font color="#E5E5E5"> and 49 don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

446
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:07,860
from the point of view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the L</font>

447
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:09,510
diversity they are all fine because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

448
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,240
mine what is my<font color="#CCCCCC"> principle my principle</font>

449
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:14,730
is that in every class I should have two

450
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,160
different values and that they do they

451
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,830
do they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have two different values but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

452
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:23,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">course you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can see this table is very</font>

453
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:25,020
sensitive the fact that if any

454
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:28,290
individual if I can link it to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

455
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:30,150
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> class equivalent class then he is a</font>

456
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:32,700
very highly likely than he has an HIV

457
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:35,340
because out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 50 49 records I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> HIV</font>

458
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:38,340
right you see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> L diversity</font>

459
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,840
doesn't understand the<font color="#CCCCCC"> disc or doesn't</font>

460
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,490
take into consideration these things a

461
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,909
simple definition of<font color="#CCCCCC"> L diversity just</font>

462
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:46,380
for the record there are different

463
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:49,290
version of cell diversity I'm just

464
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,470
presenting the simplest one ok and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

465
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:55,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">that lets to brings us to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next idea</font>

466
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:58,950
it's called T closeness what is the idea

467
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,630
of T closeness k closest is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok the</font>

468
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:04,700
distributions are good

469
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:08,130
but we need to make sure the in every

470
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:10,170
every covenant group the distribution

471
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,080
should be as close possible to the

472
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:15,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">distribution of the overall table</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

473
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,460
so it shouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like all heart</font>

474
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,700
diseases are all stomach related

475
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,620
diseases or arm out there is a

476
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,750
concentration of one kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> disease as</font>

477
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,810
a lot know what we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do we have to</font>

478
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:30,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure then within each group the</font>

479
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:32,700
distribution of the sensitive values

480
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:35,159
should be close to the overall

481
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,220
distribution on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table it's a very</font>

482
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:41,580
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea five minutes okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's</font>

483
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:49,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheeky closeness okay is it good</font>

484
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:53,040
nothing are you happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry sorry okay</font>

485
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:57,450
okay so let's see this table this is a

486
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:59,460
perfectly<font color="#CCCCCC"> good table it is for anonymous</font>

487
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:03,180
that means in every group there are four

488
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,550
values it is three diverse let's say

489
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:08,130
because you have two<font color="#E5E5E5"> different values in</font>

490
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:12,020
every group and it's a perfectly t close

491
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:14,430
overall distribution is a same<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2d in</font>

492
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:18,139
every group the distribution is same so

493
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:21,150
do you think if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get a table like that</font>

494
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:23,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">steel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and privacy attack is possible is</font>

495
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:29,840
there any linkage possible can I<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

496
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:32,070
out an individual<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course do I can how</font>

497
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,840
given the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that I have a little bit</font>

498
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:36,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">more background information so let's say</font>

499
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,270
I have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> coworker again Bob and yes I'm</font>

500
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:43,409
a disease and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let's say he looks</font>

501
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:45,830
ashen ok so if you see this table you

502
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:49,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">will find out that is the only record</font>

503
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:50,639
that matches that information so now you

504
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,370
can understand up what is the problem

505
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,700
the problem is I have quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of</font>

506
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:59,489
information about Bob this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is first</font>

507
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:02,460
problem right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I know that Bob already</font>

508
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,590
is exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this disease I know that</font>

509
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,770
he is an ancient background this is one

510
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:12,240
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the second if you remember</font>

511
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:13,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that when we anonymize this table we had</font>

512
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,970
to two different

513
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,059
kinds of attributes one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> quazy</font>

514
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:21,280
identifier than we believe that these

515
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:23,799
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can get from outside like</font>

516
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,960
from voter lists and I can we consider

517
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:29,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">that these are sensitive information</font>

518
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:32,620
that an outside of cider may not know

519
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:34,809
okay but the fact that has a corker I

520
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:37,719
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shingles there's a</font>

521
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:40,418
problem that was out of my assumption my

522
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,330
assumption is only these information is

523
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:45,010
out there from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bore a list these are</font>

524
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,689
sensitive attributes these are the

525
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:49,629
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to protect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and an</font>

526
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:51,940
adversary doesn't know but<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I do know</font>

527
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:54,130
and by knowing this additional

528
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,799
information I'm able to identify his

529
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:59,289
record and find out that he has HIV for

530
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,750
example just making an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so</font>

531
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:05,080
i couldn't model the background

532
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:07,510
information well right I couldn't model

533
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,899
the background information<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so</font>

534
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:13,450
that's leads to since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have only four</font>

535
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,070
more minutes and there are tons of other

536
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:17,350
privacy model which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

537
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:19,600
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cover right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are very</font>

538
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:22,389
innovative right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we tried many different</font>

539
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,980
things but doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work anything so and</font>

540
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:26,140
there are a number of generic attack

541
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,880
that I have no time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover but i just</font>

542
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,559
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give you in the last 3-4 minutes</font>

543
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,020
a case of what is called differential

544
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:34,990
privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so it's a very neat idea</font>

545
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:37,150
and it's a you need to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so what</font>

546
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">is differential privacy I'll keep those</font>

547
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:41,000
lines okay these are nice lines but

548
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:44,789
let's not talk about it

549
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so so differential privacy is a</font>

550
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:49,710
very different<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea so what I just told</font>

551
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,840
you you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to forget my 26 minutes to</font>

552
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,220
understand this all right and it's a

553
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,928
goodness of security community so you

554
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,820
know a little bit of our encryption so

555
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:58,409
just flash them all the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked</font>

556
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it's very different from all the</font>

557
00:23:58,409 --> 00:24:03,779
other reasonings in security and

558
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,539
encryption system is secure that if you

559
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:08,970
give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a you know an encrypted value</font>

560
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:12,049
right and if you give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a random</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> value</font>

561
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:15,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have no way to distinguish</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

562
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:17,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the encrypted value is</font>

563
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:19,110
so random i mean i do not know so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

564
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,179
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one random value and one</font>

565
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,590
encrypted value<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do not know which one</font>

566
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:24,899
is encrypted in which over just picked

567
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:27,840
up randomly<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it doesn't give any</font>

568
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:31,439
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so idea is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very similar</font>

569
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,299
to that what is the idea let's say I

570
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,250
have a raw database and I have an

571
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:36,570
enumeration algorithm let's call it

572
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:41,460
sanitized an algorithm these are the

573
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:44,158
similar words okay and my algorithm is

574
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,480
going to give an output and what is the

575
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,149
art for I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care let's say any</font>

576
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,100
output okay i'm giving a table i am

577
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:54,178
anonymizing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm generalizing whatever it</font>

578
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:56,370
does and then add an adversary if just

579
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:58,950
given the output<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what is</font>

580
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,870
the original table look like is it this

581
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:04,169
table or that table and what is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

582
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:07,408
tables the only difference from this

583
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:09,360
table to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this table is here my record is</font>

584
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:11,429
included in my record means any

585
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">individual record is included okay and</font>

586
00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:17,340
in this table that my record is not

587
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:19,199
included ok but this annual imitation

588
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,870
algorithm is such that if you give me

589
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> output I'm not able to reason</font>

590
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:28,439
whether the original table was this one

591
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:32,700
or Darwin and if I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not able to</font>

592
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:34,769
distinguish that fact then maybe it's

593
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:37,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">coming from that table and if it is</font>

594
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:39,360
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that table then there is no</font>

595
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:41,669
way you can make any inference about me

596
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,100
because I my data is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not included in the</font>

597
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:47,250
first place do you understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

598
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:51,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to say this algorithm has to be</font>

599
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:54,630
such that my data even if you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

600
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:57,780
my data it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you</font>

601
00:25:54,630 --> 00:26:00,510
outputs meaning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the anonymization</font>

602
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:02,970
algorithm will be insensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> to any</font>

603
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:05,250
particular record so there will be no

604
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">residue remaining remaining</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the end</font>

605
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:11,160
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the version you will get okay</font>

606
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:14,750
so that's the very<font color="#E5E5E5"> overall idea and it</font>

607
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:17,610
turns out that you can only output some

608
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:19,890
particular types of things okay one

609
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:24,169
minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so yeah it's a very nice</font>

610
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:24,170
idea I wish I had more time so let's go

611
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,510
so conclusion is um privacy is a very

612
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,790
important thing we shouldn't take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

613
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:34,320
normally and we did a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things a</font>

614
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,120
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good things but we need to do</font>

615
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,129
much more what we need too much more

616
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,860
because there are much much interesting

617
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:42,270
applications are coming let's say

618
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:44,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">healthcare you know the smartphones</font>

619
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:46,440
contains a lot of sensors and they want

620
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:48,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">to track how we run and all these kinds</font>

621
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,730
of things right a health care monitoring

622
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:52,470
application social networking location

623
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:54,540
privacy cell phone so all these

624
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:57,180
different different ideas are coming you

625
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,710
know these<font color="#CCCCCC"> privacy's models doesn't set</font>

626
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,780
up good with all the applications

627
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:02,700
scenario so we need to study each of

628
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,620
this scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to think about so</font>

629
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,470
we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> design the application from</font>

630
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:10,709
the very beginning keeping privacy in

631
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:13,700
mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so uh I think there's our end</font>

632
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,700
I wish I had more time but
