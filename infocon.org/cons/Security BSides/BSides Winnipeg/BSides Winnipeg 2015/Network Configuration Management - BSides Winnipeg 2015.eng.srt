1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:13,469
hi I'm 0 I<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a local I speak and</font>

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:17,340
I do networking as job but it's also

3
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:19,650
kind of my hobby um no<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that my</font>

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:24,119
favorite thing in the entire world is my

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:31,409
two ferrets parsnip and reddish it's

6
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:32,940
true at you um so today I'm going to

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,780
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you about configuration</font>

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,360
management it's so hmm change management

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,350
is the administration process of

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,360
tracking changes on in your environment

11
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:47,910
configuration management is the

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,769
administration administrative process of

13
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:55,980
tracking configuration changes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm</font>

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,260
problem my theoretical situation is a

15
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,870
small<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network which is not centrally</font>

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,089
managed therefore once a device is

17
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,020
configured and deployed I have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

18
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,310
what actually is going on with it and

19
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">potentially if nothing breaks or nothing</font>

20
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,820
acts weird I really wouldn't know if a

21
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:17,400
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> was made my solution was creating</font>

22
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,089
a monitoring service that tracks changes

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:26,159
using syslog and mysql and then displays

24
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,750
those changes to a web site overall<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

25
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">just going to go through what</font>

26
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,310
configuration management is<font color="#CCCCCC"> explained</font>

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,420
the reasoning behind why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to track</font>

28
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:39,509
those changes show a real-life situation

29
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:42,829
why it would be useful typical

30
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:45,540
deployment the benefit of what mine does

31
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:47,729
and then what I originally wanted to do

32
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,079
what it ended up turning out to be I'll

33
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,979
show you my scripts and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll have</font>

34
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:55,949
some questions I have this from

35
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,960
Wikipedia so that's better definition

36
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,990
than I could have given you want to read

37
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,990
it

38
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,070
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it is the process of</font>

39
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:09,250
tracking and monitoring changes made 12

40
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:11,350
devices which is smaller than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that okay</font>

41
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,470
cool so why configuration management

42
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:16,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay why would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to monitor my</font>

43
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,380
configuration changes when I am clearly

44
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:24,490
so epic and clearly never make mistakes

45
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">like ever well for one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially</font>

46
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,570
are not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only person making those</font>

47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,600
changes mistakes can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be made quite</font>

48
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,920
easily from being tired or new or maybe

49
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,530
you don't quite understand the

50
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,480
configurations you're implementing and

51
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:41,800
you can make mistakes<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because you</font>

52
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,750
don't know also the five billion devices

53
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,850
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> note before this is a small</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font>

54
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,880
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an exaggeration but sometimes</font>

55
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,980
when you're configuring device after

56
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:55,530
rice rice it can feel like a billion

57
00:02:50,980 --> 00:03:00,489
devices happens self-explanatory

58
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:04,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">and also we are in fact mortal we can</font>

59
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:07,830
get hit by buses and sometimes somebody

60
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:11,470
else needs to take over once you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> left</font>

61
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:15,220
security and and information<font color="#CCCCCC"> security is</font>

62
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:19,260
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> on offense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically it's all</font>

63
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:23,470
about monitoring all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things already</font>

64
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:27,070
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> my one example from real life</font>

65
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:29,170
that maybe would make sense to why

66
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:33,970
monitoring configuration changes would

67
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:36,518
be important if somebody good breaks

68
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:39,660
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the firmware and takes access to</font>

69
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:42,640
your router and makes changes for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

70
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,079
my script would notify you that there's

71
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,230
these changes being made and you can

72
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,019
notice that the start and run don't

73
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,429
match or this yesterday's<font color="#CCCCCC"> compression</font>

74
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:52,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't match today's configuration that</font>

75
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:56,130
sort of thing and it'll be useful

76
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,989
because you could catch it a lot faster

77
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:01,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so things to remember this is just</font>

78
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:04,000
a guideline haha<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started this project</font>

79
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,070
to actually inspire other people with

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,360
configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> management it's for small</font>

81
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network</font>

82
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,760
and not a large network large networks

83
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,370
would have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called ITIL which</font>

84
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,250
is information ite information library

85
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:22,000
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a collection of best practices</font>

86
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">for IT I it would include</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> incident</font>

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,140
management<font color="#E5E5E5"> and change management and all</font>

88
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,910
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fun stuff for small companies</font>

89
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,560
this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really possible just because</font>

90
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,470
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a full-time security</font>

91
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,730
manager or we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the people to</font>

92
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,580
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to actually implement it</font>

93
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:39,450
properly different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of deployment</font>

94
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:42,070
are centrally managed and per device

95
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:44,080
essentially managed would be you have a

96
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,930
central location you can push out

97
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,030
configurations<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all of the devices</font>

98
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,580
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit easier a lot less</font>

99
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,049
administrative work and it's easier to

100
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,000
monitor because if something's not

101
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,360
working you can just push out new

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,580
configuration / devices the invite her

103
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,590
devices the environment I'm talking

104
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,200
about the theory<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what I'm talking</font>

105
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,969
about still is valid to the central

106
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,390
management would be implemented quite

107
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:13,090
differently for the port<font color="#CCCCCC"> / device you</font>

108
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:15,010
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a device setup technician deploys</font>

109
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,669
that device and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you access it</font>

110
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:21,719
remotely when something is not working

111
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:24,870
sometimes nope so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the benefit</font>

112
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:29,140
the benefit of my script specifically is

113
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:31,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have backups kind of I actually</font>

114
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,740
download the configurations and compare

115
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,590
them and then store the start

116
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,050
configurations from each day so if

117
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">something messes up like you implement a</font>

118
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,000
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it messes up you can quickly</font>

119
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:45,760
restore it to the previous version

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,040
accountability because in a way because

121
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,479
I actually made multiple logins so the

122
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,280
system will have its own login<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

123
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:54,310
technician will have its own login it'll

124
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,900
be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more it would assist in</font>

125
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,370
being more accountable because it tells

126
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:02,080
you who made those changes on the

127
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:04,270
network quicker response so we all

128
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,169
remember our certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> company's data</font>

129
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:10,419
breach back in 2013 they it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was quite</font>

130
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,219
very big and it could have been

131
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:14,530
minimized because they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed</font>

132
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,110
something wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the people</font>

133
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">monitoring it told the people in charge</font>

134
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,840
you know this does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> work like this is</font>

135
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,979
not right

136
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,929
and then they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing and so yeah</font>

137
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,300
although this is super<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

138
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,830
tracking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the changes is awesome you</font>

139
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,930
actually have to take the next step<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

140
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:36,880
do something about it otherwise it's

141
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:39,310
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much invalid base configurations</font>

142
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,979
again as mentioned I'm doing per device

143
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,270
so one super sweet thing is I have a

144
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:47,139
bunch of configurations that have to be

145
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:49,150
set for all of them therefore I can have

146
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:52,050
a base I can put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in and then just</font>

147
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:54,789
make the customized changes /<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice</font>

148
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,100
theory of how my works uh what I

149
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,440
wanted to do is I wanted to have a

150
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,310
router since which is laptop<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python</font>

151
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,690
azimuth<font color="#E5E5E5"> II and SCP nice clean pretty</font>

152
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:07,750
turns out I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know anybody that uses</font>

153
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:09,610
SNMP besides using get besides you to

154
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:13,060
get they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't know anyone that</font>

155
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:15,340
did it with the triggers I know and I

156
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:19,270
asked like a million<font color="#CCCCCC"> people but whatever</font>

157
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:22,690
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine you're all jerks so I ended</font>

158
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:24,400
up changing a reality of how much it

159
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:27,060
works and really adorable ferrets I

160
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,799
swear used cisco routers this is grich's

161
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm a bunch of laptop uh I used python</font>

162
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:36,250
HTML pull up all cool stuff and then I

163
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:39,130
actually got a script from github that

164
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,870
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually download the configs all for</font>

165
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:45,639
me so I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that it</font>

166
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:52,720
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome future changes please don't</font>

167
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:54,130
judge<font color="#CCCCCC"> me um but turns out um I am NOT</font>

168
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,650
taking the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first initial staff of</font>

169
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:58,990
security and I actually have a CSV file

170
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,450
with my devices and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're clear text</font>

171
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:05,080
passwords and that's how it be logs into

172
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:07,419
them I'm sorry um future changes would

173
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,219
be I would change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that uh-uh the other</font>

174
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:11,950
thing I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add to do is I</font>

175
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,479
wrote a commit a script for ping and

176
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:16,120
latency I just didn't implement it

177
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:18,340
anywhere I didn't have time lastly when

178
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:22,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">I make a change on the network I go into</font>

179
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:25,000
l 0 0 and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go IP address bubble up</font>

180
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,919
right now it reads it in as two separate

181
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,770
lines doesn't connect them at all it's

182
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:31,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">just one shows up after the other one in</font>

183
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,799
the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would like it to be the</font>

184
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,159
command that have a parent command of

185
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,328
the interface

186
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,769
and then the IP address would be the

187
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:38,899
child command so they're a little bit

188
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:41,870
linked because right now you can add an

189
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:46,180
IP address to a router and don't know

190
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:50,089
what interface it is already scripted so

191
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:52,099
hmm alrighty so I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you've</font>

192
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:55,759
heard but cisco has this built-in thing

193
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:59,870
called just even called basically it

194
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:01,639
sends the syslog updates to whatever you

195
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,870
want it to send to so right now i have

196
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:10,699
it set to send to this IP address of the

197
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:14,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">user on my laptop server thing and it's</font>

198
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:16,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool because it sets sends the IP</font>

199
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,769
address the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hostname all of that fun</font>

200
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:20,599
stuff supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay here somewhere i</font>

201
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:24,620
think it's the logging that I just

202
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:27,230
passed cool I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> prepared</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this ah and</font>

203
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,360
you one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to do is you set</font>

204
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,519
the size but uh and then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

205
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,529
actually set the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host you want to send</font>

206
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,060
it to I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an issue where I</font>

207
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:36,410
couldn't figure out why the heck it

208
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,319
wasn't sending it was because I didn't

209
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,959
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to send it anywhere and as a</font>

210
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:44,089
note when I started I was doing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my</font>

211
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:46,008
macbook and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I moved to a linux and</font>

212
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:48,290
then it all died again and that's

213
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:50,449
because they in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac it sends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the</font>

214
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:54,079
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that log</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on linux it send it</font>

215
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:56,979
sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to its own syslog log turns out</font>

216
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:59,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright now we'll go back to this one</font>

217
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:03,139
I'll take so I actually have a cron job

218
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:07,310
that runs this every<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute it reads in</font>

219
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:12,730
using you can see there it actually

220
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:17,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">reads in line by line the syslog log and</font>

221
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:22,009
using red regex it matches the time set

222
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,959
date or<font color="#E5E5E5"> tamson host name user and the</font>

223
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:27,019
command that was actually run and then

224
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:28,699
it does its thing and checks if it's in

225
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:31,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">the database and if it is not in the</font>

226
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:32,899
database then inserts it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have it</font>

227
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,209
printing the command just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I can</font>

228
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:37,670
verify<font color="#CCCCCC"> it actually ran but you don't</font>

229
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:40,369
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do that also remember to</font>

230
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,759
actually commit it because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't and</font>

231
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,759
it took<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

232
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:51,630
also other weird friggin thing I notice

233
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,150
is because every time it sends those

234
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:56,970
syslog updates it actually commits a

235
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:58,350
line that's like not enable or something

236
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,780
and it fills your database with a

237
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:03,780
million of those so I am check if it's

238
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:06,630
that and if it is I ignored again please

239
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:10,949
ignore<font color="#E5E5E5"> this super-awesome bad practice</font>

240
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:17,850
of reading in SB<font color="#E5E5E5"> st3 huh yeah shut up</font>

241
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:20,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay hmm another interesting thing is</font>

242
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:24,450
getting the date and yesterday's date in

243
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:29,490
Python not easy not<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier you would</font>

244
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:30,990
think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be but no it's not so I</font>

245
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:35,280
create<font color="#CCCCCC"> the folders I want to store my</font>

246
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:38,010
 in and then I use a really cool

247
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:40,680
thing I got off of github it's called

248
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:43,890
iOS config fetch it downloads the

249
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,680
configs for me using<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and ssh and</font>

250
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:48,090
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I love it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't</font>

251
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to do anything I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just have to pass</font>

252
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:56,460
they username password and that's versa

253
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:58,620
and then I try for the start because

254
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,940
sometimes people don't save the running

255
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,730
config to start I don't know why because

256
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">it was stupid but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it happens and so I</font>

257
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:09,330
try it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just in case of errors and then I</font>

258
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:12,000
save the configurations I have a temp

259
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,950
folder for the run and then a specific

260
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,700
dated folder for the startup config

261
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:22,020
another thing i learned diff is really

262
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:26,310
stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use for this so again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i read</font>

263
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:28,380
in a CSV file also stupid and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I compare</font>

264
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:31,290
why make a folder and then I compared

265
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:34,200
the start and run configs to see if

266
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:36,300
they're different and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I compared</font>

267
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,790
yesterday startup-config to today

268
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">startup good thing theoretically this is</font>

269
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,810
really cool on right now it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

270
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,940
just storing it in a file showing the

271
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:49,589
changes what I wanted to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> was set</font>

272
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:52,620
triggers but turns out you don't want to

273
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:55,150
do that because diff compares it as if

274
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,830
it is a file not as

275
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">if it's logically it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't</font>

276
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,220
logically compare it so like if you

277
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,439
change an IP address you think oh it's

278
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,860
just that line but know if it changes

279
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,990
anything it shifts the entire file and

280
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,380
then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sends you the entire config</font>

281
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:13,180
and that was annoying as hell so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

282
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,890
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that anymore okay so I'm actually</font>

283
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:20,079
gonna show you my super cool web page

284
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:23,410
and hopefully it actually works yeah it

285
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:29,380
does this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> exciting this is what I was</font>

286
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:31,420
worried about so yes so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

287
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,850
output I am NOT a web development

288
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:37,599
developer but I made<font color="#CCCCCC"> it black and green</font>

289
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:41,260
so it's hexer right um so basically what

290
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,330
happens is that the script<font color="#CCCCCC"> to parse out</font>
