article very good point so the history

56
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,150
of this bridge and it is written about

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,150
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> article i will show you how somehow</font>

in just a moment is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this bridge is in</font>

59
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,340
the parkways of Long Island New York it

00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:22,829
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed by the architect robert</font>

61
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,019
moses and built there a series of these

00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:28,530
bridges built between the 1920s and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

63
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:31,019
70s the notable part about the bridges

64
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,940
is that they're short they're not very

65
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:37,859
tall what kind of vehicle can get under

66
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:42,870
the bridge cars obviously what kind of

67
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:49,940
vehicles cannot get cannot fit trucks

68
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:49,940
and do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bus would fit</font>

69
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:57,970
unlikely I think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is no so</font>

70
00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:01,839
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where the story turns a bit dark</font>

71
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:04,180
it turns out that Robert Moses and there

72
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,180
are different versions of this tale but

73
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:11,260
Robert Moses had a vested interest in

74
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:14,680
keeping a beach near his very nice house

75
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:18,269
on Long Island keeping the beach not too

76
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,910
busy and with a certain type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

77
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:25,000
clientele which was once described as

78
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:28,570
upper or<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable people of upper or</font>

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,300
comfortable classes at this time in Long

80
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:34,260
Island's history you can imagine there

81
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:38,080
were also racial lines that were

82
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:44,590
encouraged to use the beach and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so</font>

83
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:47,530
in other words this bridge I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> Robert</font>

84
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:49,630
Moses certainly had political views but

85
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,448
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question I'd like to ask you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is do</font>

86
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:55,570
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bridge itself could have a</font>

87
00:04:52,449 --> 00:05:00,520
politics could the bricks and mortar and

88
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:04,150
the steel have ethical qualities in an

89
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,430
article<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's quite well-known now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

90
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,650
so in this article called do artifact of

91
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,660
politics<font color="#CCCCCC"> Langdon winner is published</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

92
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,539
nineteen eighty he makes the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

93
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:16,330
in fact a bridge bricks mortar could

94
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:17,950
have ethical qualities not just exist in

95
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,800
an ethical environment or a political

96
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:24,669
environment but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself could be seen</font>

97
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,789
as to embody what winner calls as social

98
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:31,180
inequality so today I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> advocate</font>

99
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:34,270
for a way of expanding your thinking to

100
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,250
think about technology and<font color="#E5E5E5"> security in a</font>

101
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,620
way that invites awareness of the

political forces that are at play in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

work you do the first slide the next

104
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:47,860
slide I would show you would have a word

105
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,190
on it called socio-technical system and

106
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:53,470
this is a term that is becoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and</font>

107
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,389
more popular suggesting that technology

129
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,770
three major tenets of this way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six to society and the</font>

131
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,810
first one so you'll have to envision

132
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:06,139
this is to reject technological

133
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,150
determinism so this means it has it's

134
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:10,789
tempting to think of this but

135
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,620
technological determinism assumes that

136
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:16,789
technology develops by some invisible

137
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:19,100
hand so instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking oh we had</font>

138
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:21,590
radio so of course the next step would

139
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,720
be the television and then since we had

140
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">the television and then then we had math</font>

141
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,630
and logic and electricity and machinery

142
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:31,340
technological determinism would say well

143
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:35,360
then the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just the logical</font>

144
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:37,130
next step so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a dangerous</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way of</font>

145
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,470
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about technology because it</font>

146
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:43,370
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assume that technology evolves</font>

147
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:46,370
on its own in actual fact it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more I</font>

148
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,470
think it's important to acknowledge that

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,479
technology is not developed merely

150
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,970
because there is the technical need and

151

makes the point I mean it's a tragic

199
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:10,500
the second one is to reject technology

technology as merely the artifact or the

201

object so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of a social</font>

204
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,579
to think of your cell phone on its own

205
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,009
rather you need to think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as part</font>

206
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:30,779
of an entire process or a

207
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:31,680
socio-technical system I find it helpful

208
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,960
to compare

209
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,649
contrast different technologies that do

210
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:40,589
similar things to get a sense of how the

change the technology itself for

297
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:07,299
so instead think of technology as

298
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:17,349
political and this brings us right back

299
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:20,289
to the bridge whereas so technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

300
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:22,289
bridge itself I'm advocating trying to

301
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:26,139
persuade you that the bridge itself

302
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:30,369
contains values Johnson says that

303
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:32,739
artifacts are infused with value so a

304
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:35,709
bridge is a very part in the pun<font color="#CCCCCC"> but a</font>

305
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:38,699
very concrete technology if we think of

306
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:41,738
a technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's much more abstract</font>

307
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:45,399
algorithms in this crowd at this time

308
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:49,479
come to mind have you read the book<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine</font>

309
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:53,859
algorithms that change the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

310
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:56,829
so I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> this book quite fascinating</font>

311
00:15:53,859 --> 00:16:01,869
and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the algorithms they described</font>

312
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:04,029
is page rank so a question to you is

313
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:06,789
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the politics of PageRank the</font>

314
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:11,349
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> elementary description of</font>

315
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:14,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">PageRank is to say that websites that</font>

316
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:19,149
have more links have a higher page rank

317
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:24,309
and thus are returned sooner in the list

318
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:28,059
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> results on a search engine that's</font>

319
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:31,988
what you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point so popularity</font>

320
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:35,049
increases rank so arguably PageRank is

321
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:40,799
democratic it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wikipedia could be</font>

322
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:43,358
considered anti-establishment and that's

323
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other thing about page rank which of</font>

324
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:47,259
course I think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all know was developed</font>

325
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:50,049
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people that went on to found</font>

00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:53,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google is that ironically and perhaps</font>

327
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:54,608
alarmingly page rank which founded the

328
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,488
Google search engine and may have

329
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:58,569
started off as anti-establishment

330
00:16:56,489 --> 00:17:02,829
arguably has become the new

331
00:16:58,569 --> 00:17:04,898
establishment as in as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it seems also</font>

332
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:08,589
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> prudent to mention if I'm</font>

333
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:11,888
describing that technology must exist in

334
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:13,720
a larger political context I must I

335
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:15,898
think I<font color="#E5E5E5"> must mention that page rank</font>

336
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,449
means very little if you live in China

337
00:17:15,898 --> 00:17:21,658
where and other countries where the

338

339
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:30,100

340
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:33,190
Tiananmen Square in Google that's an

341
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,199
ironic that's it doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense look</font>

342
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:38,619
up Tiananmen Square using the search

343
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:42,450
engine Google and then use the same copy

344
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:45,158
and paste<font color="#E5E5E5"> that term into Bay do which is</font>

China's number one search engine and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:52,090
will find<font color="#CCCCCC"> ston entry's so this shows</font>

347
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:55,419
that search engines and their algorithms

348
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:57,879
are not operating as<font color="#E5E5E5"> mere technology but</font>

349
00:17:55,419 --> 00:18:02,200
they are part of and must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be evaluated</font>

350
00:17:57,879 --> 00:18:06,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">within a political and social culture so</font>

351
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:09,899
what's the big point how does this talk

352
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:13,960
relate to you as information

353
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:16,119
professionals my point is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

354
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,519
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists as part of a</font>

355
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:21,668
socio-technical system then the people

356
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:23,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">that design technology you need to be</font>

357
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:26,740
aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the impacts of the technology</font>

358
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:29,469
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop as well as the influences</font>

359
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:32,679
that determine which technologies you

360
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:35,049
work on and contribute to I'm saying

361
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:37,090
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> software and security protocols are</font>

362
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:39,820
not just written out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of technical</font>

imperative they are written<font color="#E5E5E5"> into and as</font>

364
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:45,340
a result of a larger social phenomena

365
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,049
it's important that when we introduce

366
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:50,649
people to computer science and

367
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:53,309
engineering we explain that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

368
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:56,709
think about the politics of the

technology you work with the politics<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,399
and whether you're an IT<font color="#CCCCCC"> professional or</font>

377
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:22,039
even as technology user

378
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:24,889
all of these decisions you make change

the socio-technical landscape while<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

yourself think about technology so what

are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to do it's arguably impossible</font>

391
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:05,349
others and make your work culture

392
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:09,950
inclusive to encourage everyone you know

393
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:12,109
to learn a bit about coding imagine if

394
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:14,960
we had a language<font color="#E5E5E5"> that only a few people</font>

395
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:17,418
could speak but<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone depended on the</font>

396
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,969
people that spoke that language those

397
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:21,979
few people those speakers would have a

398
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:24,259
lot of power and maybe too much power

399
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:25,999
that's why it's important that everyone

400

tries their hand at speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>
