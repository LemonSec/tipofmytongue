1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:11,880
hello folks so today I'm going to talk

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:15,450
reasonably high level about modern

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,789
implementation of TLS in enterprise no

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,400
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> person controls everything in fact</font>

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:25,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">the infrastructure controls you most of</font>

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:32,519
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time so Who am I well really I'm</font>

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:35,849
nobody as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ron noted but if I must um it</font>

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,010
turns out I did you know loaded up calc

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:42,270
last night it turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing</font>

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:44,760
internet crap for 19 years I feel like

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:50,250
ancient person but I'm young in my

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:54,000
department<font color="#E5E5E5"> good yes um so did CSU of em</font>

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:57,690
I went on to system administration to

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,579
pay for my degree<font color="#E5E5E5"> and did a bunch of</font>

15
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff after that some some of you know</font>

16
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">it some you don't doesn't really matter</font>

17
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:08,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">and i was doing shadow infosec for a</font>

18
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,539
long time basically the annoying guy in

19
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,170
departments at like you're doing it

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,909
wrong so now I get to tell people yeah

21
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:20,400
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it wrong but how can I help</font>

22
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:21,780
you fix it so that's the picture was

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,270
made by a friend of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mine because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I got a</font>

24
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:30,210
reputation for being<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy that says</font>

25
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:33,899
no a lot and so I embrace<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I say no</font>

26
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:38,699
Lutz but now I say no but how<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we</font>

27
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:40,710
turn that into a yes later so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

28
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,350
TLS well everybody in this room knows

29
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,979
what it is it's essentially we all call

30
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:50,189
it ssl we all use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> term ssl the term</font>

31
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:53,689
ssl should just die in a fire preferably

32
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:56,369
now preferably even<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years ago</font>

33
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:58,770
essentially we're going to you can't

34
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,469
have a conversation without context and

35
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">the context for SSL is broken people</font>

36
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,089
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but they all understand it</font>

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,840
wrong including me most of the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

38
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,610
screw it up essentially what TLS is it's

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,110
a channel for communication that does

40
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,870
two things in tooth

41
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,550
only you get encryption which is

42
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">ninety-nine percent of what of what</font>

43
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:24,090
people understand TLS to be and trust

44
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,980
either federated or consolidated but

45
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,220
trust is just as important if not more

46
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,109
important than the encryption we just

47
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:38,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't talk about it or we don't leverage</font>

48
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:40,020
it properly so<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's not talk about ssl</font>

49
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,770
anymore you know if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the</font>

50
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:47,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">gnu/linux</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crap that's fine use TLS / SSL</font>

51
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:49,080
or just say TLS when people say SSL try

52
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,280
to steer<font color="#CCCCCC"> the conversation away because</font>

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I said you can't really have a</font>

54
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,640
conversation when people understand

55
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:58,440
things differently so start with

56
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">something fresh well I've seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

57
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,030
implementations I've implemented a lot

58
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:06,630
of bad ones and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only inside I</font>

59
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:09,600
had was for TLS it's the screw we hammer

60
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,519
into literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything well screws</font>

61
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,510
definitely not the right tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this</font>

62
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:18,269
job the hammer well because we love

63
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,010
smashing things but the end result is

64
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:21,420
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a broken piece</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of wood or you</font>

65
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,640
get a broken whatever you're trying to

66
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,140
hammer this into so yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get the</font>

67
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,600
little check<font color="#E5E5E5"> mark that says encrypted</font>

68
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,238
but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not getting much else in fact</font>

69
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,940
you're losing more in terms of

70
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,680
functionality support costs you name it

71
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:40,130
you're not providing anything other than

72
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:45,180
pain for the people behind the scenes so

73
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:47,250
we have lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems mostly they're</font>

74
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,310
just configuration configuration and

75
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,739
understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how to apply TLS two</font>

76
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,709
things most of the time is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a check</font>

77
00:03:52,739 --> 00:04:01,400
box vendors like to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> you one</font>

78
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:03,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">click install also one click fail so</font>

79
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,630
lots of things especially middleware

80
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:10,040
will enable client authentication but

81
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:12,570
not tell you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so you've got</font>

82
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,750
sessions or two servers talking to each

83
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:19,019
other using TLS as the you know session

84
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,060
transport and the first step is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay try</font>

85
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,419
to authenticate the client servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

86
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,980
auto what do I do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this I don't talk</font>

87
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,810
that way do server authentication only

88
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,270
so you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just wasted a bunch of the</font>

89
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,310
handshake time and you've provided no

90
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,109
value you've produced great error error

91
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:39,640
messages but<font color="#CCCCCC"> nobody looks at those</font>

92
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:43,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">anyway we also see people using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> San</font>

93
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:46,000
certs our wildcard cert sore basically

94
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,770
using certificates to get around their

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,340
understanding as opposed to applying

96
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:55,120
them appropriately a common thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

97
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,830
seen is creating a sensor which is the

98
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,680
host name fully qualified domain name

99
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:03,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then the short version IE the domain</font>

100
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,220
name chopped off that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the</font>

101
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,750
little green<font color="#E5E5E5"> checkmark but you've just</font>

102
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,960
given away<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of your infrastructure at</font>

103
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:14,350
that point because anything dot nothing

104
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,760
can be matched by anything so what

105
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,210
exactly are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

106
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,159
certificate nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wildcard</font>

107
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,859
certificates star not anything not

108
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,440
anything well you get encryption but

109
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,090
you've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thrown trust out the window</font>

110
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,920
there are there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good use</font>

111
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,979
cases for it like farming and load

112
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,680
balancers that have farms of services

113
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,480
underneath but most of the time you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

114
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,070
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> away without using it such as using</font>

115
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">a sand certificate with the name of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

116
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:46,210
specific host as well as the virtual IP

117
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,760
or virtual host name another<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

118
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:52,080
expensive thing that was popular is to

119
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:55,000
use third-party cas for internal stuff

120
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,620
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> bother why are you spending hundreds</font>

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,560
of dollars a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> on certificates that</font>

122
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,350
the outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> world will never see is</font>

123
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:06,160
because you don't trust yourself well in

124
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:10,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">many cases that's true but in my</font>

125
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,040
experience auditors love to see external

126
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,550
trust like it gives you something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

127
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,170
don't already have so you need to

128
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,090
leverage your internal cas if you don't

129
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:21,280
have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> well you probably do you just</font>

130
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,229
don't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called if you have</font>

131
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,159
80 you have an internal CA you just

132
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:28,570
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you're using it another thing</font>

133
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,350
that's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more common now</font>

134
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:33,790
because browsers love to complain is

135
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,950
serving your endpoint certificates with

136
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:38,560
out the full chain the certificate is

137
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:40,610
good but your browser<font color="#E5E5E5"> will crap all over</font>

138
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,379
it saying I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know this guy well</font>

139
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,610
it really does it just can't get the

140
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:45,530
full chain from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection to</font>

141
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:49,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">compare to its local trust or so it says</font>

142
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:52,280
an you did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wrong I see this time and</font>

143
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:56,080
time again it's it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> easiest thing</font>

144
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,638
to mess up and self-signed certificates

145
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,770
you find any tutorial about how to

146
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,879
enable TLS on anything and it will tell

147
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,378
<font color="#E5E5E5">you how to create a self-signed</font>

148
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,780
certificate but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you how to</font>

149
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:08,479
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or when it's appropriate so it's</font>

150
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,460
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much never appropriate because</font>

151
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,068
developers use it to save<font color="#E5E5E5"> time because</font>

152
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,289
asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for anything as well wasting your</font>

153
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:16,849
time or it takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years to get a</font>

154
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:19,039
certificate so we'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

155
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:20,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">self-signed and call it a day well then</font>

156
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,469
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't get any of the trust</font>

157
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:26,299
functionality that TLS offers you so if

158
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:28,430
you have a CA make sure you can

159
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,960
provision them really fast to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

160
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,729
developers actually use your

161
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,099
infrastructure as opposed to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

162
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:39,889
it which is what i did for most of my

163
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:42,020
career so the other big challenge in

164
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:44,810
gigantic corporations especially ones

165
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,508
that take your money or<font color="#E5E5E5"> know lots of</font>

166
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,310
very sensitive things about you is

167
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:53,629
regulations for me their pain in the ass

168
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:56,419
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i also like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're there they</font>

169
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:59,569
keep the organization in check but not

170
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:02,539
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a useful way regulations</font>

171
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:06,529
tend to be super vague you must have an

172
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:08,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">ex or you must do X and then p and then</font>

173
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:11,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">Q and yes we know those don't all fit</font>

174
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,859
together but you have to do them anyways

175
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,270
so traditionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> like at least what I'm</font>

176
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">seeing now and what I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> living through</font>

177
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:23,150
now is that regulations are telling us

178
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,860
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> must use technology X so expensive</font>

179
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,679
spear sharpeners for the dull edge of

180
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,689
the spear we're not poking anybody with

181
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,610
it we're not getting any attack surface

182
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:33,229
reduced we're just implementing

183
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,409
technology and hoping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does</font>

184
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:39,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">something good for us in many cases</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

185
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:41,000
can the regulations are good the problem

186
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,860
is is that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find a way to</font>

187
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,510
integrate it into our infrastructure so

188
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:49,640
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not just wasting time and</font>

189
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:52,310
money so for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL inspection</font>

190
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,410
I've seen a number of products<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will</font>

191
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,479
say yeah we do TLS expect

192
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,819
inspection but the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> cipher we</font>

193
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,550
support is null with null and no well

194
00:08:58,819 --> 00:09:03,949
that's great you don't get encryption

195
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:08,990
you don't get trust you get nothing so

196
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:11,810
what's the value of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your product uh so</font>

197
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:14,720
how do you integrate this stuff well you

198
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,790
have to cuz regulations say you must so

199
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,759
let's think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it a little</font>

200
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:23,120
differently let's first talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> wha</font>

201
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,680
laughs is a generally a new thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

202
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:31,399
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just mean that people are now</font>

203
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:34,430
using them exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> so think of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

204
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:37,399
load balancer with a with grep

205
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:39,790
essentially there are some learning

206
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,259
facilities and it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very useful</font>

207
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:44,360
especially in giant infrastructures that

208
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:47,569
don't change or that move at a glacial

209
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,540
pace<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you can bolt the stuff on</font>

210
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:53,569
and then gain a little bit of time to

211
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:56,060
remediate the back end it's not really

212
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:57,649
how that how the sales people like to

213
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,939
sell it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you because they're just like</font>

214
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:00,769
oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> well this Indian you're good and you</font>

215
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:02,899
never<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to touch anything no it's a</font>

216
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:04,699
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting point and for</font>

217
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:07,040
applications especially support folks

218
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:08,660
that are just learning to use that 20

219
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,880
year old mainframe application that

220
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,910
someone wrote that retired five years

221
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,110
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it allows you the</font>

222
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,639
ability to understand what your

223
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,310
application does the profiling

224
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:21,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">self-learning can be extremely valuable</font>

225
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,119
figuring out how exactly your

226
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:26,089
application is doing something<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

227
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,860
opposed to we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just run it and we deal</font>

228
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:30,050
with complaints as we get it so it gives

229
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:33,949
you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of insight if you apply</font>

230
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:36,859
it appropriately so well laughs are

231
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:39,199
mostly terrible if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just think about</font>

232
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:42,350
them a different way they can be

233
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:45,309
extremely useful the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> really big</font>

234
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,449
challenge that browsers right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

235
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:49,370
ramming down everyone's throat is

236
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:53,029
perfect forward secrecy well

237
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:55,939
diffie-hellman a gong show at the moment

238
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:59,000
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same time it is very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> useful</font>

239
00:10:55,939 --> 00:11:02,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you use you know non-standard curves</font>

240
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,850
and you decide to use non common primes

241
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:08,089
like the one not the one in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Box</font>

242
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:10,339
generated 2k or higher one and apply

243
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:13,279
play it to your web<font color="#CCCCCC"> server application</font>

244
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:16,220
server they do very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good things the</font>

245
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,230
problem is you get the nice political

246
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,269
scare tactic that all over inspection is

247
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,040
now dark we can't see anything we have

248
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:25,449
no intelligence well you didn't in the

249
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:30,949
first place but now you have even<font color="#E5E5E5"> less</font>

250
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:32,240
so the best part about going blind is

251
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:34,189
that you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even know you're blind</font>

252
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,620
all of your inspections stuff will go

253
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:39,680
and it's just traffic I can't see it's

254
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:43,129
got to be good right pass it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I</font>

255
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,378
haven't seen a tool yet or an inspection

256
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:47,990
service that will go I can't decrypt

257
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:51,680
this or I can't see this let's send an

258
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:54,889
alert that's right<font color="#E5E5E5"> for giant amounts of</font>

259
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,719
false positives but if you're wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

260
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:59,180
be able to inspect anything knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

261
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't and can't inspect is probably</font>

262
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,959
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be spending your time</font>

263
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:06,050
finding tools that you know lets you

264
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:09,920
filter that out that's very very

265
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:12,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult so in enterprises in large</font>

266
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,870
infrastructure we tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to paint</font>

267
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:17,120
things with very large brushes we have

268
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,910
one color and one really<font color="#E5E5E5"> large brush and</font>

269
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,389
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets painted with it why</font>

270
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:27,170
efficiency or money or we're too lazy to

271
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:29,569
learn so how do you deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this do</font>

272
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:31,490
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just consider all of your encrypted</font>

traffic collateral damage and just not

00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:38,389
inspect it or do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think through the</font>

275
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:41,119
problem a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more so this is a</font>

276
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:44,209
typical infrastructure that you would

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:47,029
see for applications in NT r enterprise

278
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:50,209
insert your buzz word here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would call</font>

application server with a single path

282

twice yeah it's not going to happen not

283
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:03,050
only is every vertical line a different

284
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,569
group in your organization but you can't

00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,470
going so you can have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the inspection</font>

291
00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:20,569
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world but all you're looking for</font>

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,410
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> application bugs you're not really</font>

293
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:25,819
seeing

294
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:27,980
how things are running so how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

295
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:31,519
change things and move some of that

296
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:36,709
inspection get some value out of it but

297
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:38,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">also have nice and clean security for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">your customers things that you want to</font>

300
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:46,009
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer that they put a little bit</font>

301
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:48,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">more effort into securing the front end</font>

305
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:57,740
they solve it but in reality as a

306
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:00,649
consumer I don't really care so how can

307
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">we leverage that well we can do the</font>

308
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:04,970
stupid thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just encrypt everything</font>

309
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:07,160
if you ask anybody in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISO</font>

311
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">this protocol the answer will be yes</font>

312
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:13,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well that doesn't solve any</font>

313
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:21,079
problems for me in fact it creates more

314
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:23,269
now my inspection stuff nothing so

315
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:27,859
either have to move it around which

316
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:29,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">again it will still see nothing or I can</font>

317
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,990
just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's collateral damage but I'm</font>

318
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:34,310
secure according to<font color="#CCCCCC"> qualis I got my</font>

319
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:41,389
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> A+ that's got to mean something</font>

320
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:43,910
right well let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> try it again let's use</font>

321
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:46,240
SSL termination previously it was a

322
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:51,199
technique<font color="#E5E5E5"> used because TLS is slow</font>

323
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:54,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">encryption is slow well it's not but we</font>

324
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:57,500
do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put a nice clean secured</font>

325
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,420
interface to our customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> so lets do</font>

326
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,360
TLS here the bot that the buck stops

327
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,910
here everything else is widely<font color="#E5E5E5"> open well</font>

328
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,880
that solves one problem but introduces

329
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:10,759
three more problems that introduces is

330
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,309
yes you get inspection but you've lost

331
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:16,130
trust in your infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have no</font>

332
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:19,279
means of determining exfiltration of

333
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:21,079
data because you've only got<font color="#CCCCCC"> one thing</font>

334
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">in and you're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really talking you're</font>

335
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:26,000
just letting things out without even

336
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:28,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at it properly so that's not a</font>

337
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,740
solution either now notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm just</font>

338
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,689
drawing boxes I'm not really changing

339
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,089
the infrastructure except in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case</font>

340
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:36,769
I'm putting the IPS behind

341
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:38,420
the control point where the control

342
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,459
point is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a laugh or a load bouncer</font>

343
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,939
or some other form of Earth reverse

344
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:45,949
proxy so that's a subtle<font color="#CCCCCC"> change it</font>

345
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:48,259
allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> me inspection after that point</font>

346
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:52,430
but I've only<font color="#E5E5E5"> got solved one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font>

347
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:55,790
problems so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not good either so</font>

348
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:59,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again so here's here's the</font>

349
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:01,759
interesting thing if you disable teal

350
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">our PFS or perfect forward secrecy</font>

diffie-hellman you name it choose your

352
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:12,470
acronym of the day essentially if you

353
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:13,939
hide it<font color="#E5E5E5"> or if you disable it you get</font>

354
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,589
your inspection back you install<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

355
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:17,329
private keys on your inspection devices

even<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell your certificates and a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">private keys on inspection device sorry</font>

358
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,160
that that is a really important point

359
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:27,470
and you get all<font color="#CCCCCC"> your inspection back but</font>

360
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,139
let's use the TLS trust layer a little

361
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:31,730
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better so what is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the trust</font>

362
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:34,399
layer mean well a certificate authority

363
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,649
is a person or a thing or an

364
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,180
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> that provides you with</font>

365
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:41,269
certificates<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says this one is good</font>

366
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,459
this one is not good you have an

367
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:45,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">external one for people that don't trust</font>

368
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:48,109
you which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

369
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:51,949
way it should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you also have</font>

370
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:53,629
an internal CA and use that internal CA

371
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:55,819
to provision all your internal

372
00:16:53,629 --> 00:17:00,110
infrastructure in your demarcation point

373
00:16:55,819 --> 00:17:01,878
is the load balancer wife layer we're

374
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:06,860
just assuming HTTP but this will work

375
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:08,929
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all TLS style implementations so</font>

376
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,938
what you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> now is you can implement</font>

377
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:13,149
mutual authentication on your back end

378
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:15,110
so that wasted client certificate

379
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:17,989
configuration well now let's use it

380
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:20,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's say I will only talk two things I</font>

381
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:23,329
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I trust for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CA that I</font>

382
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:26,119
provision all of the default<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones will</font>

383
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:27,948
just remove them so when something

384
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:31,520
you're not expecting talks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this layer</font>

385
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:33,289
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your application it fails and this</font>

386
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,270
it does exactly what it's supposed to do

387
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:36,980
it fails we look at the logs we were

388
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,899
mediate call assert do whatever you need

389
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,090
to do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least now you have that</font>

390
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:42,830
intelligence before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just assumed</font>

391
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything was great because no one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

392
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,490
screaming at you

393
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:52,120
so just by that subtle change we've

394
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:54,399
solved not only the problem of my

395
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,409
inspection stuff goes dark but we've

396
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,520
also increased the availability and

397
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:01,059
reliability of our back-end

398
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,549
infrastructure the only thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you got</font>

399
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:08,590
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> train people and that's really really</font>

400
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:10,929
hard well the other thing since we're

401
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:14,590
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> web based stuff what about</font>

402
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:17,409
those fancy new headers like<font color="#E5E5E5"> STS HST are</font>

403
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:19,480
essentially HST s public key pinning all

404
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:21,490
that other good stuff well that's great

405
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,770
if you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> with browsers and you</font>

406
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:27,309
should use them but they also<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce</font>

407
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:30,760
problems specifically the public key

408
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:32,440
pinning is great but if in the in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

409
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:38,650
previous infrastructure each one of you

410
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:39,700
flying administered by somebody else how

411
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,010
do you know when you replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

412
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,710
certificate that the pin changed well

413
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:46,210
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great way to create an outage</font>

414
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,130
so you need a lot more coordination

415
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,470
there you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot more process are</font>

416
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,330
you getting the benefit out of pinning

417
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:55,780
that you would by not using it at all

418
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:59,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need pinning for sts to</font>

419
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:02,260
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's preferred it helps but it's</font>

420
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:04,570
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily required so use it</font>

421
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:07,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">appropriately and then put it in later</font>

422
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:10,120
after you worked out the process CSP

423
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:16,510
it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your browser's adhere to</font>

424
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:19,928
it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> java applications don't so it</font>

425
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:21,340
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaks things if you let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

426
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:24,700
you have hundreds of applications in

427
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,649
your enterprise odds are a huge portion

428
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">of them or third party do you know how</font>

429
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,380
they work<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you know how they're</font>

430
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:35,950
implemented do you know if they're using

00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:41,169
type negotiation you don't know so in

433
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,959
implementing this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your lap or</font>

434
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:46,630
on your head end it's great but expect

435
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:49,030
things to break that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay failure is</font>

436
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:52,590
good you just have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know what to do</font>

437
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:52,590
with it and be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work through it</font>

438
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:02,010
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some solutions well the</font>

439
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:06,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">first thing trust between application</font>

440
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:09,720
layers is by far the most common thing I

441
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,909
see is problems if<font color="#CCCCCC"> your Java logs have</font>

442
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,240
anything that say pkix odds are you

443
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:18,090
didn't include your cas in the trust or

444
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,850
I see this so often I wrote a script

445
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:23,340
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> defang JVM which just looks for</font>

446
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:27,120
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> CA certs file on a system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

447
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:30,510
injects our common trust cas i also use

448
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,699
it to disable export export crypto

449
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:36,060
because a lot of three-letter companies

450
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:39,630
will ship things to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Canada</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with export</font>

451
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:42,210
crypto enabled and not tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you which is</font>

452
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:44,010
fun but you have to really really be

453
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:47,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at things to to catch it and</font>

454
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:50,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">then remediate it no cipher suites</font>

455
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,720

456
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the weeds and you're like I'm going to</font>

457
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,950
lock this thing down a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred percent</font>

458
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,959
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to break it and the error</font>

459
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:00,240
message you're going to get is either no

460
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:03,120
protocols available or no snow common

461
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,560
cipher<font color="#E5E5E5"> Suites so in this one it's more</font>

462
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,239
or less trial and error because most of

463
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,300
the logs won't tell you what ciphers it

464
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,750
tried and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> openssl s client</font>

465
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,970
or Wireshark to see what the endpoints

466
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,950
are negotiating and then do your own

467
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:19,650
overlap but most of the time it's

468
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,210
because you've disabled sslv3<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some</font>

469
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:24,540
really old app or some really old

470
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:27,420
appliance and it won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get updated so</font>

471
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:32,790
first check that then go deep down with

472
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:35,400
those two other options when the thing

473
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:36,870
the whole public chain issue when you

474
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,170
serve the chain along with your

475
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:42,090
certificate that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty recent that</font>

476
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:44,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">things fail</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because usually it would</font>

477
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:47,760
look and try to do validate up the chain

478
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:49,350
on its own by it i<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean the client now</font>

479
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,629
the client saying well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm only going to</font>

480
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,429
validate against myself once you tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

481
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:55,230
what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to validate so it looks</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">at the chain make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've</font>

483
00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:00,540
served the entire chain and then

484
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:02,160
compares it to its own trust or the

485
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,440
communication for that was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

486
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,650
bad so a lot of sites broke really

487
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,420
really quickly I am still seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

488
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:11,670
this day I'm still trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a piece</font>

489
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,740
of infrastructure get to get updated to

490
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:15,510
send the full chain like everything is

491
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,870
right all the configuration is correct

492
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:21,390
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> missing the chain bundle and</font>

493
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:23,969
it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard thing to</font>

494
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:27,510
communicate because uh it<font color="#E5E5E5"> validates for</font>

495
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:29,400
me well try going outside for a bit the

496
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:34,350
world is actually different than what

497
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:37,920
you see in the window so and finally the

498
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:41,100
usual browsers complaining about invalid

499
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:43,980
names well this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a good thing because</font>

500
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:48,120
well like the previous talk from

501
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:50,040
yesterday dns buzzing uh men in the

502
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,500
middle attacks these errors are there

503
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,000
for a reason now if you've gone through

504
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,000
that the due diligence of set everything

505
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,670
up appropriately these errors are

506
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,100
something for you to action not mitigate

507
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,480
by throwing in a sense or wild card or

508
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,300
something just to get that<font color="#CCCCCC"> little check</font>

509
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:10,220
box and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business happy look at it</font>

510
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:14,100
take the time don't just do quick fixes

511
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:17,160
well so how do we fix these problems in

512
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:20,280
enterprises<font color="#E5E5E5"> well essentially it's</font>

513
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,590
consultancy you have to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone in</font>

514
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:26,090
your organization that tries to

515
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:28,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff and then educate</font>

516
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:31,709
rather everyone from developers to

517
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:33,330
operations staff take the time to walk

518
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:37,200
people through listen to their problems

519
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:39,929
and try to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> them not only be</font>

520
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,690
compliant but show them the benefits of

521
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:44,250
being compliant without any effort like

522
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,050
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> previous example of throwing a laugh</font>

523
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:48,540
in front of something to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> qualis to</font>

524
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:52,500
give you an a instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a see that has</font>

525
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:55,710
value you can give that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost no</font>

526
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,660
effort so do it the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more value</font>

527
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:59,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">you provide someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the higher</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

528
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,600
probability that when you say they're

529
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,540
doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong they'll listen to</font>

530
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,889
you because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if all you say is no well</font>

531
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually people are going to start</font>

532
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">ignoring you so turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no into it yet</font>

533
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:12,870
and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you provision things</font>

534
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:15,830
for developers faster than they can

535
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,830
break it themselves

536
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:21,539
finally don't be afraid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> meat you a</font>

537
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:24,950
lot it's super super powerful the

538
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:28,110
problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's nobody really uses it</font>

539
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:31,470
some good resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ivan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ristic spoke</font>

540
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:34,229
bulletproof TLS it's expensive but it's

541
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:36,960
really well written it's focused on

542
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:38,700
browsing and not the ca infrastructure

543
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,100
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big hole in the market right</font>

544
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:44,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">now but it's better than nothing in fact</font>

545
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:46,320
I recommend it highly openssl s client

546
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:49,830
and s server there are the most

547
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,870
important tools in my toolbox<font color="#CCCCCC"> I use them</font>

548
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:54,870
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use wireshark or anything</font>

549
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:56,908
else they're also if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to see how</font>

00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:59,489
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are changing on the real internet</font>

551
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:01,679
the trust where the internet movement

552
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:04,679
basically scans for stuff and provides

553
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,240
reports it's a nice high level saying

554

apply a certificate to my clients as

574
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,790
well as servers so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only do i</font>

575
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:28,399
authenticate the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server</font>

576
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:29,899
authenticates me right yeah you would

577
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,600
you wouldn't hand them to them you would

578
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:35,480
install them in workstations you would

579
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:38,240
deploy them via ad or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

580
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:46,460
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also makes SSO trivial to implement</font>

581
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:48,470
where SSO is single sign-on well export

582
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,960
grade crypto is essentially those tsa

583
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:54,050
locks that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adrian talked about last</font>

584
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:57,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">night do you have do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have encryption</font>

585
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:59,480
yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh that's great I have keys I have</font>

586
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,340
locks but they're really crappily

587
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,090
implemented so they can be broken in

588
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:06,949
real time or they're easy to inspect so

589
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,480
for regulations that's great because I

590
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">can break everything and I don't have</font>

591
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,930
and I give this false sense of security

592
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:17,360
to users the US had this thing called<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

593
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:19,280
export policy that said strong crypto is

594
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,020
not allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sold from the u.s. to</font>

595
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,580
anywhere else in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world well</font>

596
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:25,730
everywhere else in the world said screw

597
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:29,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">you we'll just sell it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instead so it</font>

598
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:31,820
solves nothing but gives us regulatory

599
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:34,699
bodies at least some form of useless

600
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,169
comfort the problem is is that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

601
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,330
third-party software and a lot of

602
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:41,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure is sold from US companies</font>

603
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:42,830
and they enable this export encryption

604
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:46,189
by default and make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really difficult</font>

605
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:48,470
for you to turn it off it's a huge

606
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:50,180
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's getting worse the only</font>

607
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:53,090
way to solve it is to start keeping

608
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:55,160
vendors to task so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to</font>

609
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,540
disable this kind of cipher suite why

610
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,630
doesn't your application let me do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

611
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,970
and

612
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:02,010
not by their crap when they won't give

613
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,900
you a satisfactory answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately</font>

614
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:06,150
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only way to do it it's not very</font>

615
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:08,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">good on the business side because now</font>

616
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:10,650
you're slowing projects down but it's

617
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:16,580
the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to get rid of this export</font>

618
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:16,580
problem is is that a good answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>
