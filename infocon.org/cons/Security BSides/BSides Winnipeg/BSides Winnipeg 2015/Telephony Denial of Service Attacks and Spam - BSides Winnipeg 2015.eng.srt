1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:06,629
thanks Ron yeah so you'll have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to excuse</font>

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,210
me a little bit I might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little slow</font>

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:14,219
today because it was my retirement party

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:16,590
last night and yeah so I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

5
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:19,020
architect for a local telecom company

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,580
and I learned all<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of really</font>

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,970
interesting things about how the

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,859
telephone network works and you know

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,109
experienced a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well like</font>

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,750
robo calls and telephony denial of

11
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,660
service attacks how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you here</font>

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,540
know what a robocall is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of you</font>

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">have had a robo call ok so for those of</font>

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,930
you who don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what a robocall is</font>

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,029
it's like those weird calls that you get

16
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,239
from random numbers or local numbers

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,469
that sound kind of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

18
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,459
congratulations you've won a cruise and

19
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:52,140
then you hang<font color="#E5E5E5"> up so that's I'm going to</font>

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,239
kind of show you guys how that works and

21
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">how they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off of it and</font>

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:01,919
potentially how we can stop it so just a

23
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,239
disclaimer here basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't use any</font>

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this knowledge for nefarious purposes</font>

25
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:11,970
and if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't blame</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me ok so</font>

26
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:15,540
what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem a lots changed in the</font>

27
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:19,439
telecom industry over the last I'd say

28
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:24,540
decade even and it's kind of created an

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:29,339
environment where it's inevitable that

30
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:32,430
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all get these robo calls the change</font>

31
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,880
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the environment is this telecom is</font>

32
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,430
now cheap right it costs pennies or

33
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,880
fractions of pennies a minute to send

34
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:45,600
calls out to the public services

35
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,470
telephone network calls are now

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,298
automatic so you can plug I'm actually

37
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,060
going to demonstrate for you guys today

38
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,259
you can take a script and generate a

39
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,090
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of calls to people's cell phones</font>

40
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,090
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> volunteers later</font>

41
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:06,810
calls are now anonymous<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the telephone</font>

42
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,419
network used to be tightly controlled so

43
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,250
you kind of had a pretty good idea who

44
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,589
was calling you there were people who

45
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,780
could get around it but it's way more

46
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:23,100
pervasive now oh here we go happy

47
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:26,910
birthday haha<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheers oh thank you that</font>

48
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:30,060
helps<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot thank you Ron thank you all</font>

49
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:34,410
right where was I was rated anonymous

50
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:36,239
right anonymous so yeah so actually part

51
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:40,650
of my demonstration you're going to get

52
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:44,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">a call from 204 555 111 1 and it's</font>

53
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty easy so the other part of it that</font>

54
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,360
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't experience with robo calls</font>

55
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,030
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess it is kind of persistent is</font>

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,160
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's automated because it's</font>

57
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,530
cheap because it's anonymous it can

58
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,230
easily be persistent and my demo is

59
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,730
going to show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> how bad that is it</font>

60
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically stops you from using your</font>

61
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,720
phone if you know what a denial of

62
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,209
service attack that's exactly what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

63
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,760
it stops you from using your phone so

64
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,860
for a personal user with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cellphone not</font>

65
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,290
a big deal you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you turn it off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

66
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:17,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">a while until they go away but if you're</font>

67
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:19,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">a business and this guy's hitting you</font>

68
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,820
for five days and then calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> you on</font>

69
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,040
your personal phone and extorting you

70
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:27,380
for 10k I mean that's kind of bad right

71
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,780
and there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to stop it right now</font>

72
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:33,060
so I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a</font>

73
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,340
history lesson and just show how we got

74
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,239
here aight already touched on it a

75
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:41,190
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> but many years ago the</font>

76
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">telephone network was more tightly</font>

77
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:46,320
controlled than it is today was a person

78
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,930
calling another person the caller ID

79
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,310
wasn't settable the PSTN that's the

80
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,829
public services telephone network

81
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,680
basically the telephone network would

82
00:03:52,829 --> 00:04:02,760
set the caller ID for every call that

83
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:04,290
would go out and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> tightly linked</font>

84
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,290
with the source of the calls at that

85
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:11,940
point nowadays you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of later on</font>

86
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,250
people started lighting up

87
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,170
exes are public branch exchanges these

88
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,760
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> these multi line telephone systems</font>

89
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:21,000
that are typical in your in office

90
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,940
offices and things like that they

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,410
started getting you know big trunks into

92
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,000
the telephone network they and they

93
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,910
started demanding features from the

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,060
telcos saying hey you know right now

95
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:36,240
whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody from our organization</font>

96
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,250
makes a call to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside world those</font>

97
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,010
calls all appear is the same number we

98
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,870
want you know if Joe calls somebody to

99
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:46,110
show up as Joe's number or Bob calls

100
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,700
someone to show up as his<font color="#CCCCCC"> number telcos</font>

101
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,880
are like okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we charge you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for it</font>

102
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,960
and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> like yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay perfect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deal</font>

103
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,020
not really thinking of the implications

104
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:58,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">of course right so what actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

105
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:01,020
then is the telco has to let the pbx

106
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:03,510
tell it what the caller ID is one is

107
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,180
sending the call out ah no problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

108
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:08,640
that at least at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time because well</font>

109
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,070
the telcos were charging an arm and a

110
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,950
leg for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this service so you know not</font>

111
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">your everyday Bob could just go and</font>

112
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:19,919
change his caller ID he had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

113
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:25,310
serious deal with the telco and then

114
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:28,830
they connected PB X's<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the Internet</font>

115
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:30,540
great idea actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the people who</font>

116
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">did it was a great idea they started</font>

117
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:36,060
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> bank because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these big</font>

118
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,190
trunks into the telephone network which

119
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,870
they could set anything on and then

120
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,610
they're like oh well I also have like

121
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">this internet connection why don't they</font>

122
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,780
just like connect the two and then start

123
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,900
selling telephone service and you know

124
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,099
become a competitor for the telco

125
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,989
awesome i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use their</font>

126
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,870
infrastructure to beat them at their own

127
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,330
game sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a great idea and so</font>

128
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,250
what happened is because they there's so

129
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:03,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">much competition for these trunks the</font>

130
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:05,730
price started going down but also they

131
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,620
started selling<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-user telephone</font>

132
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:10,680
service and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually they started</font>

133
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,410
selling you know anybody who wants a

134
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,430
telephone over the internet like all you

135
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,480
need is a credit card<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font>

136
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:24,110
generate or steal those easy enough and

137
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:24,110
as the no<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

138
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:31,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah it anyways I did retire it so</font>

139
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,969
basically that made the caller ID

140
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,040
settable and cheap and that created<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

141
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:40,060
situation where we are now we're almost

142
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,560
anyone can sign up for<font color="#CCCCCC"> an account that</font>

143
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,600
allows them<font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to one of these</font>

144
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> allows them set their caller</font>

145
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,810
ID name display and achieve relative and

146
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:53,860
on in anonymity as long as they know how

147
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:57,220
to use someone else's credit card so you

148
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">can imagine that there are many people</font>

149
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:05,650
doing this and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the architecture</font>

150
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:08,020
of the attack basically this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is me this</font>

151
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:11,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">is my laptop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right here and I'm going to</font>

152
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:13,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you this I run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a java application</font>

153
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:16,540
that i wrote which uses some libraries

154
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,969
but basically what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does is sets up a</font>

155
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:22,330
connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid provider or many</font>

156
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:24,520
VoIP providers one thing I did notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

157
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,909
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the VoIP providers that I</font>

158
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:32,650
could get<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahold of our semi-legit</font>

159
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:35,200
businesses who they try to stop VoIP

160
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,479
attacks at least they make efforts so i

161
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,789
could only generate two concurrent calls

162
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,850
to the same phone number from my

163
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:45,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer which kind of frustrated me</font>

164
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:49,030
initially until<font color="#E5E5E5"> i realized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that most</font>

165
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:51,099
VoIP providers have 30 40 points of

166
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,590
presence all over the world and they

167
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,790
don't always<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to each other so I was</font>

168
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:57,190
like okay I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to download a</font>

169
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:59,080
list of all your points of<font color="#E5E5E5"> presence and</font>

170
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to randomly hit them and</font>

171
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,130
then I can generate 40 or a hundred

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,850
calls or whatever I want and there's no

173
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:08,830
blocking it so the application evolved

174
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:11,200
as I was trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> figure this out but</font>

175
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,180
anyway so you connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these VoIP</font>

176
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,270
providers they give you the connection

177
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:21,790
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the international telephone network</font>

178
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:23,890
and from there the calls go out now if I

179
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,510
was an actual black hat and trying to

180
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">make money off of this and extorting</font>

181
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:30,550
businesses I probably wouldn't use

182
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:33,039
legitimate ones there are plenty I've

183
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:36,250
heard of in countries that don't

184
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,400
cooperate<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is one of the problems</font>

185
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,860
the telecommunications industry is that

186
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:44,610
tracing these calls as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

187
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:48,670
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your country it becomes so</font>

188
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:50,590
hard like and even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you get to the</font>

189
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">source country probably the source</font>

190
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,820
countries like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Becca Stan and</font>

191
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,870
they're cops or are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be like</font>

192
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:01,690
what what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you mean telephone network</font>

193
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:06,150
or their telco is actually incentivized

194
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:12,640
through payments to hide the attackers

195
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:16,120
good so I need two volunteers and people

196
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,130
okay you and come up here with<font color="#CCCCCC"> your cell</font>

197
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,400
phones we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to show everyone what</font>

198
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:23,950
happens one more yeah real cell<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone</font>

199
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:28,560
okay come on come<font color="#CCCCCC"> on up here don't worry</font>

200
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:35,730
there's no permanent damage I swear as

201
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:42,579
long as i turn it off after right<font color="#CCCCCC"> hahaha</font>

202
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:47,370
two shots<font color="#CCCCCC"> yang all right here we go so I</font>

203
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:53,530
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to type your number in here</font>

204
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:55,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">just after the 20 for now is a live demo</font>

205
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,939
I hope it works I was a little drunk

206
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:01,510
when I set this up so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

207
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:06,150
guarantees and as soon as I start this

208
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:09,450
what I want oh you're not a tool for

209
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,449
hopefully this works

210
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:20,130
the suspense is killing me guys is that

211
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,570
is that the right number because it's

212
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:26,990
gonna is gonna up if it's not a

213
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:32,670
real number oh pardon the language 286

214
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:35,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we're good it is</font>

215
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cold in here okay so I'm gonna</font>

216
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,640
explain to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen</font>

217
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:42,689
first you probably already read this but

218
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:45,510
you know I like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk basically i'm</font>

219
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:47,970
going to send just a single concurrent

220
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,080
call to each of you your phone is going

221
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start ringing it's going to have a</font>

222
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">weird ass caller ID and i want you to</font>

223
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer it but then it's going to hang up</font>

224
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,250
on you and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call you again</font>

225
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,430
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can ignore it or you can answer</font>

226
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,870
it that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here is they can't</font>

227
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,599
really use their cell phone for<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

228
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,190
else while<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm doing this until of</font>

229
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:16,230
course two shots yegg make their way up

230
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:17,670
here so are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I got I got</font>

231
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time you know I only had seven</font>

232
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:23,370
slides and this is number six so you

233
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:27,000
know like I kind of figured I'd talk

234
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:30,390
more but being tired from retiring kind

235
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,410
of made me<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose some of my storytelling</font>

236
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:38,640
and I'm just filling here for you know

237
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:42,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'm gonna break your phone now here</font>

238
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,150
we go i'm hitting play as java so you

239
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,150
know

240
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:58,699
is a ring yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what's the caller</font>

241
00:11:50,209 --> 00:12:05,800
ID on there 555 111 1<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay oh but I can</font>

242
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:05,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">change that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright yours isn't working</font>

243
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:13,790
to a for 555 111 1 all right I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did I</font>

244
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,970
did randomize it but I got weird results

245
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,740
because I guess they want real<font color="#E5E5E5"> area</font>

246
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:22,360
codes or something it's another check

247
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:27,529
they run so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know future reference</font>

248
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:30,920
still going yeah every time I'm hanging

249
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:36,829
up it's just calling right back and ok

250
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:39,139
and it's done so I I only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks ok ok</font>

251
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:42,559
so I was dossing my cell phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> and my</font>

252
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:45,350
girlfriend cell phone and I it stopped

253
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:48,110
working for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some reason and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I eventually</font>

254
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,779
realized that my router kept crashing

255
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:53,540
because I couldn't ping it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

256
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:55,670
know why doing a telephony denial of

257
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,040
service attack over my shot router

258
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:01,368
crashed it but they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

259
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,649
weird anyways so I did it over my cell

260
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:05,360
phone and it just it handled it no

261
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:10,420
problem so apparently my cell phones

262
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:13,309
more powerful than my sha router so and

263
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:16,729
this is where somebody in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

264
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:20,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably going to troll me but don't be</font>

265
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:24,740
so glum there is hope I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

266
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:28,160
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all remember the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 90s I I kind of</font>

267
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:30,559
remember the 90s a little bit but we

268
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,269
used to get a lot of spam right like you

269
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys remember like was like a hundred</font>

270
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:38,799
spam messages a day in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Inbox</font>

271
00:13:34,369 --> 00:13:38,799
because there's no filters or anything

272
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:45,949
eventually we kind of figured out how to

273
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:49,999
block that using like analysis and

274
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:51,799
pattern recognition and<font color="#CCCCCC"> grey listing</font>

275
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:54,379
where you know you'd put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> message into</font>

276
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:56,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">like holding pattern until you know you</font>

277
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:59,540
knew it was a good one

278
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:02,640
well we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do some of the same</font>

279
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:04,709
tactics with the telephone calls with

280
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,930
the telephone network and so my proposal

281
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:09,480
and and I've sent this actually to the

282
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:12,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">crtc because they actually asked for</font>

283
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:17,340
proposals my<font color="#CCCCCC"> proposal is this listen</font>

284
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:19,200
inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada we can control the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> calls</font>

285
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:22,560
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can kind of control the quality</font>

286
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,500
of the calls relatively easy like we did

287
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,089
you know those robo calls in the not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

288
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,910
last election but the previous one we

289
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:32,580
actually found the guys I mean it never

290
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:35,339
went to prosecution of the people who

291
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,910
really should have been paying for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

292
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:41,700
but hey whatever there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fall guy so</font>

293
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:44,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know job done so we have effective</font>

294
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:47,400
control to trace and prosecute

295
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:50,220
perpetrators within the country so we're

296
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,959
good there right most of the problem

297
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,230
though is coming from outside of the

298
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:57,330
country right<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Beca Stan</font>

299
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:59,670
I'm not I just like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like the word</font>

300
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:04,830
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually from a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beka Stan so</font>

301
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:06,719
don't quote me on that but oh so what

302
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:13,350
I'm proposing is kind of like a firewall

303
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:18,540
around Canada and this would take no I'm

304
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:21,180
not Donald Trump okay it's it's a little

305
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,860
more arcane than than a firewall but it

306
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,020
kind of does<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same thing what it</font>

307
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,700
would do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it would require all of the</font>

308
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:30,470
telcos to work together and collaborate

309
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:32,880
and build a system that filters

310
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:38,040
international calls cut yeah I know it's

311
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:43,920
unrealistic okay but a guy can dream

312
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:46,680
right yes collaboration across the

313
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:53,010
industry uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't that what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CRTC is</font>

314
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:55,410
supposed to create oh um so anyway so if

315
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:58,350
you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a telephone call like an</font>

316
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:00,900
email like really it is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

317
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:02,610
message that's coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from somebody</font>

318
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,160
outside of the country that says hey

319
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,900
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> person wants to call this person</font>

320
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,559
they're going to come in on this trunk

321
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:12,819
and you can say

322
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,939
or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say uh yeah I know you I</font>

323
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:19,748
trust you yeah come on in come on in but

324
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:23,919
like if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting like calls from</font>

325
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:29,499
an international telco where the source

326
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:33,279
caller ID is 204<font color="#E5E5E5"> 555111 one I kind of</font>

327
00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:41,199
think you should drop those but just you

328
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:42,879
know my<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion it well but can you port</font>

329
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,849
your number outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the country now I</font>

330
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:48,369
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think so but I understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

331
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,980
like for example skype right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

332
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:52,449
put your your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own caller ID on skype and</font>

333
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:56,109
make calls<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's originating from</font>

334
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:58,269
the US however<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could build rules that</font>

335
00:16:56,109 --> 00:17:00,429
say okay well we know and trust skype we

336
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:02,079
know where they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from will</font>

337
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:04,839
allow those calls through right the

338
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,638
thing is there's no information being

339
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,379
gathered and analyzed and we need to

340
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:11,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">start doing that in the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way that we</font>

341
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,480
did with spam so that we can stop all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

342
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:27,250
these crazy calls I got five minutes who

343
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:29,799
wants questions yeah they have no idea

344
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:32,019
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're doing it's just bad</font>

345
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,760
scripting like a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these guys are</font>

346
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:36,850
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 year olds who started their</font>

347
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:41,190
online business you know and just know

348
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:47,549
stuff but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of stuff anyone else</font>

349
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:47,549
come on where's the troll oh yes sir

350
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,980
so that's kind of like okay so the

351
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,420
question was the calls actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

352
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,480
like they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be coming from our own</font>

353
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:08,970
company now there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a guy who had a</font>

354
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,100
talk on<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS earlier and he was talking</font>

355
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you just make micro changes in</font>

356
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,780
the URL de to trick people it's like a

357
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:18,150
social engineering technique right like

358
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:20,520
I can send you an email that looks like

359
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,930
it comes from your CEO and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

360
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to open that attachment because i want</font>

361
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:29,160
that TPS report right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now man right so</font>

362
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:31,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's social engineering so it just makes</font>

363
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,700
you answer the call it's you're more

364
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,740
likely to answer it if it's a familiar

365
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:50,190
number they're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside people's</font>

366
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:54,480
heads right well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can say it they're</font>

367
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:56,910
not looking nobody's looking right I

368
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,750
think AT&T started looking in<font color="#CCCCCC"> their in</font>

369
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:02,460
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense like they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they did</font>

370
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:04,230
actually like some independent guy wrote

371
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,570
some piece of software that I think

372
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:11,040
they're using that's similar similar to

373
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:13,560
this idea but predominantly nobody's

374
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,870
looking because they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> make money</font>

375
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,360
off these calls<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if you know</font>

376
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:21,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people use the</font>

377
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,790
network they make money so yeah there's

378
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,850
there's absolutely no incentive for them

379
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:29,399
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect us from this unless we make</font>

380
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,620
them have incentive by you know

381
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,540
leveraging<font color="#CCCCCC"> or government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CRTC and</font>

382
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,580
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say something</font>

383
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">silly like call your Minister or</font>

384
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:41,250
something but hey you're free to do what

385
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:43,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want any other questions Oh in the</font>

386
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,730
back there

387
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:56,020
uh it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the call is coming from</font>

388
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:57,730
them then they're blacklisted well yeah

389
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,879
so does this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is part of the</font>

390
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:03,039
problem right like I remember when I

391
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started getting robo calls i would</font>

392
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,600
just blacklist them and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i realized</font>

393
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:10,029
the number was always changing how many

394
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you have had someone call you and say</font>

395
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:18,250
hey did you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just call me yeah a couple</font>

396
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:20,110
people so so yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've actually</font>

397
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,000
heard of some pretty crazy things where

398
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:24,580
like highly secure numbers have been

399
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,440
called and they call back the number

400
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,939
that was somebody else and they're like

401
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna get lawyers after you're not</font>

402
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,809
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call these numbers and like</font>

403
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:36,220
it just turned into you know a snafu

404
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:54,010
right so yeah any other questions yes

405

409
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:05,620
there were all the robocalls sending

410
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,940
people to wrong polling stations and

411
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,250

419
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:28,960
we're finding the guys you can't do that

420
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">outside your borders because of the</font>
