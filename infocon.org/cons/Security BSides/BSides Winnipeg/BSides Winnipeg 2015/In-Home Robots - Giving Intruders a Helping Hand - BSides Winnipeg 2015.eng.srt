1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:09,900
yeah besides so here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go we're kicking</font>

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,969
off besides I'm very happy to be one of

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first talks I'm Daniel ray I'm here</font>

4
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:19,140
with Brittany polish new cloth<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font>

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,270
have some fans we're here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:26,849
in-home robots giving intruders a

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:29,099
helping hand so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is we've</font>

8
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,619
all seen lots of reports of planes

9
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:34,460
automobiles and medical<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices being</font>

10
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,750
under scrutiny for security problems on

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:40,200
they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the same problems</font>

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,200
that robot space for example robots all

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,129
have wife at home mostly in home robots

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,050
that we've seen have Wi-Fi access

15
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:50,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bluetooth you can adjust what they're</font>

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,860
doing and control them with phone

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,930
applications which I mean we've seen

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,059
automobiles that's what can be used to

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">man in the middle same thing with web</font>

20
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,010
applications and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our famous are</font>

21
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,920
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our favorite parts with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> robot</font>

22
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,200
Amy here is we found open USB ports that

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,260
anybody can get access to if they have

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,119
physical access to your robot the

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,210
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about robots though is</font>

26
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,159
they have specific exploits so you can

27
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,979
see by the pictures here that robots

28
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,530
have different form factors we have ones

29
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:25,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">that like the Robo boa which means one</font>

30
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">that looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a snake we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gebo the</font>

31
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,280
one in the corner here<font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

32
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,110
fan it's apparently social robot and

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,780
we've got things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Darwin's which</font>

34
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,299
look like small humans so these form

35
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,460
factors well them in home robots you

36
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,310
interesting things they can manipulate

37
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,229
your space they can manipulate you it's

38
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,600
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of interesting and the sensors they</font>

39
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:46,890
do or do not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pet can change what</font>

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,949
they can record and what information

41
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,960
they can get from<font color="#CCCCCC"> your home exactly and</font>

42
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,240
the important thing with in-home robots

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,399
is a setting they're used in the fact

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,039
that they're in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> home someplace that</font>

45
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,780
you think is private and basically when

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">you save it's like a save file when you</font>

47
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,870
come back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your home you expect it to</font>

48
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">be exactly how you left it the</font>

49
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,759
and the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about robots is that</font>

50
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,770
they're part of the internet of things

51
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,720
especially when they're in your house so

52
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,580
the Robo BOTS for example will try and

53
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,980
interact with all the technology around

54
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">it it'll interact with other ones for</font>

55
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,450
the same company it'll try and interact

56
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:26,989
with robots from different companies and

57
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:29,329
just how it uses its social space leaves

58
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,940
a home open to a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

59
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">different risks and the last point is</font>

60
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,210
social engineering especially things

61
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,450
like the Darwin or will show you later

62
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:41,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the talk now it's another humanoid</font>

63
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,429
robot both are used to social engineer

64
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,530
people we've done research I'm doing

65
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,810
persuasive robotics right now getting

66
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,270
robots to persuade people we've got

67
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,670
robots that if they tell you what<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

68
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,200
people are likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to listen so you know</font>

69
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,589
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of these interesting things</font>

70
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,450
that robots bring into your home why do

71
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,340
we talk about robots robots robots maybe

72
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,500
you don't have a robot in your home but

73
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,470
thinking at least does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody here have</font>

74
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">rumbas yeah look you have robots in your</font>

75
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,310
homes that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool right that's</font>

76
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">great so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is starting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come out</font>

77
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,510
the room is one of the most prolific

78
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:17,958
robots perhaps in this day and age and

79
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:19,910
um they're in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> house they're pushing</font>

80
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,620
things around they're vacuuming your

81
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,970
house and you know maybe you've had some

82
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,400
problems to room but<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe destroying</font>

83
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,470
something knocking something over if

84
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,300
intruders had this kind of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

85
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,250
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your room what could they do</font>

86
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,170
but rumors aren't the only robots<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

87
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,970
are becoming more common drones as you

88
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,609
can see there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are becoming really cheap</font>

89
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,410
and really good even now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get</font>

90
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,730
really great drums for just hundred

91
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,250
hundred fifty dollars all the way down

92
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:45,320
to ten to fifty dollars almost pocket

93
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:48,500
money and they have cameras they have

94
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,570
spinning helicopter blades<font color="#E5E5E5"> and these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

95
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">often controlled over Wi-Fi over a phone</font>

96
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,100
connection bluetooth um so all those

97
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,650
vulnerabilities from earlier if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

98
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,150
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them maybe you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fly</font>

99
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,280
helicopter of death coming at you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

100
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,500
your house these are things think about

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,120
but we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> homes away from home we</font>

102
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,320
often<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend a ton of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time at work I'm</font>

103
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,780
sure some of you sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you're</font>

104
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,790
living there essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> but at some</font>

105
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,830
some works like for example in factories

106
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,870
there are robots right now not like the

107
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,280
big scary ones that are behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> cages but</font>

108
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,160
robots working right beside people

109
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,979
helping assemble

110
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,380
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is another type of robot in an</font>

111
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,900
even more<font color="#CCCCCC"> dangerous situation that we</font>

112
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,159
have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider it up but maybe</font>

113
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">something a little closer to our hearts</font>

114
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,000
in the bottom left here you can see

115
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,099
that's not a stuffed animal here we have

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,590
that's actual robot that's made to help

117
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:39,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">take care and be therapeutic to elders</font>

118
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:42,060
in care homes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> its name is pero pero</font>

119
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:44,340
is absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> adorable this thing is</font>

120
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually made after the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Canadian harp</font>

121
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,429
seal so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> people say stop clubbing</font>

122
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:53,070
baby seals baby seals so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point of</font>

123
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:55,410
pero is that in this is directly from

124
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:58,290
the website it allows the documented

125
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:00,480
benefits of animal<font color="#CCCCCC"> theri therapy to be</font>

126
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">administered to patients in environments</font>

127
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,160
such as hospitals and extended care

128
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,099
facilities where live animals present

129
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,590
treatment or logistical difficulties

130
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,630
this sounds great we have it's a robot

131
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,820
it's helping take care of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people you</font>

132
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,219
care about people that are in stressful

133
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,710
situations people that might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

134
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,720
healthy as you'd like them to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> Parros</font>

135
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,940
made to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all easier make people</font>

136
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,130
feel comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sounds like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a great</font>

137
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,350
idea and to be clear it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future</font>

138
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:32,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is like deployed right now in some</font>

139
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:34,560
care homes yeah so pero comes with a

140
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,570
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of hardware in it it's got</font>

141
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,310
light sensors so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can see when people</font>

142
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,890
are passing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in front of it if there's</font>

143
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,080
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> movement it's got a microphone so it</font>

144
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,820
can record what's happening it's got

145
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,340
speakers so it can interact back with

146
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,560
you it's got position sensors so it's

147
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,989
got accelerometer can see how fast it's

148
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,850
moving it can see which how you're

149
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:58,320
holding it all these sort of small

150
00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:00,210
details and it also has<font color="#CCCCCC"> motion so one of</font>

151
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,969
the things proud does is if you say

152
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:05,070
common words it'll start purring to

153
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:07,290
those noises if you're petting pero well

154
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:10,530
it says that same thing if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually</font>

155
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:13,830
says if you beat pero it'll learn to

156
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:17,609
actually kiss a bit and it won't repeat

157
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:20,479
what it's doing that's been so back in

158
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,480
1999

159
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:27,849
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NSA had problem with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Furbys so</font>

160
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:30,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">Furbys are small adorable kind of</font>

161
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:33,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually creepy little things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

162
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,350
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred English words and 100</font>

163
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,950
furbish words furbish being a mishmash

164
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:40,960
of adorable cooing noises basically but

165
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,539
the NSA was under the impression that

166
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,880
the hundred English words came from its

167
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,070
environment so that it would pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

168
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,320
what you're saying and repeat it back to

169
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,730
you later so apparently what was

170
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:56,440
happening was people were bringing these

171
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:58,420
into work and so at the NSA thought well

172
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,710
they're spies<font color="#CCCCCC"> there they're going to be</font>

173
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to get this classified information</font>

174
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,940
and if you bring them home like who

175
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,530
knows what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keywords they're</font>

176
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,000
gonna be saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your children</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

177
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,559
your children right say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or you know</font>

178
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,040
grandma might come and understand what's

179
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,690
happening probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a good idea to my</font>

180
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,720
favorite quotes though that I actually

181
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:19,060
got these from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the BBC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the Guardian</font>

182
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,910
and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple like actually what I think</font>

183
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,700
are decent papers but the furry cute

184
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:30,580
exterior is merely a shrewd cover for

185
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:32,680
more covert activities what or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 13</font>

186
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:37,270
centimeter gremlin like operatives are

187
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:40,150
wanted this time for spying like<font color="#CCCCCC"> tariffs</font>

188
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:43,180
like what but the same thing sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

189
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:46,390
happens with pero again when you pet it

190
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,890
and it gets used to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a word and it'll</font>

191
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">start responding that even when you're</font>

192
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:52,719
not petting it so say grandmas getting a

193
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,060
little like angry at her next-door

194
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,010
neighbor and it's like damn<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mabel like I</font>

195
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,229
wish<font color="#CCCCCC"> she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just died or something just</font>

196
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">like terrible but if you know she's</font>

197
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:05,260
petting to see like this like dr. Evil's

198
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:08,500
style like and it gets the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point where</font>

199
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,789
Mabel or Mabel does die and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

200
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,530
comes to tell her she's like Oh Mabel

201
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:14,890
died in the steel starts<font color="#CCCCCC"> purring in the</font>

202
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:16,450
corner like it might reveal<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

203
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,039
information about grandma that makes her

204
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:22,270
a little bit suspicious in like how

205
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mabel died so you know when you tell</font>

206
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,469
pero something it's like British war

207
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,659
propaganda

208
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,850
telling a friend may mean telling the

209
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:35,099
enemy hello seal robot you're telling a

210
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:37,169
commie so maybe that seems a little

211
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">far-fetched maybe your grandparents you</font>

212
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:41,640
know don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have these in their in their</font>

elder homes yet but something<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe more</font>

214
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,630
close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to home in the future is the now</font>

215
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:49,890
now that now is a humanoid robot as you

216
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:52,320
can see here arms legs speakers come

217
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,189
back around do cool stuff and well often

218
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,800
use right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now in research and</font>

219
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,480
competitions the company algebra on who

220
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes this is positioning them as a</font>

whole in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Home Companion so these things</font>

222
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,550
they want them to be in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> home</font>

223
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,810
they're saying well the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step is</font>

224
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,120
just to make him available to<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone</font>

225
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:09,089
that his capacity to interact makes him

a new member of the family ask him<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

asking but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

229

something we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about look</font>

232
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">tall and just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like the parallel has</font>

233
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:28,199
loudspeakers has directional microphones

234
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:30,390
to full RGB cameras has infrared sensors

235
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">LEDs it can tell if it's touching</font>

236
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,890
something if something's grabbing it or

237
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,530
touching it has accelerometers etc and

238
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,449
all of these speakers are to give it our

239
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">all these sensors are to give it a</font>

240
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,839
better understanding of its environment

241
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,510
who's around what they're doing what

242
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:48,089
they're saying just like you know our

243
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:50,400
eyes and ears so that's great how are

244
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:52,110
people using this well it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

245
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,689
in real life maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as common as</font>

246
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,970
apparel yet or the Roomba but<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

247
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,350
have been using now as customer service

248
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,720
personnel for example in the top right

249
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,850
you can see Mitsubishi Bank actually

250
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,310
uses now in one of their banks to greet

251
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,050
people it talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them you know greets</font>

252
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,250
them and then they tell them you know

253
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">what they want to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the bank and</font>

254
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">then now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll be like oh yeah</font>

255
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,930
investment banking is over here it knows

256
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,240
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to direct them knows how to make</font>

257
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:17,370
conversation be polite make them feel

258
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,839
comfortable so the skills it's getting

259
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,640
here are things where it's learning how

260
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,380
to interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you it's learning how</font>

261
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,020
to get your trust and it's getting

262
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,750
skills on how to basically manipulate

263
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:30,240
situations right just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do every</font>

264
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,529
day I mean customer service<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now has</font>

265
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,360
also

266
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:36,480
been used as a training assistant

267
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,279
actually for astronauts so what they've

268
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,170
been piloting lately is the now abused

269
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:43,350
as for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example will be used to teach</font>

270
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:44,699
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> things or well they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of example</font>

271
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,019
exercising the now will be kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

272
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:47,479
a training agent it'll be like oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I</font>

273
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:49,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">just push a little more just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> push harder</font>

274
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,930
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually makes them stay you know</font>

275
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,160
more closer to their training regimen

276
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,910
it's really good at encouraging people

277
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,529
and influencing their behavior addition

278
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've said it's sold as an in-home robot</font>

279
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:02,189
so of course you can do some household

280
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:05,579
chores the now is good at learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

281
00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:07,620
the now is able to learn say<font color="#CCCCCC"> your your</font>

282
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,819
everyday schedule by using these sensors

283
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,709
to know when you're there when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

284
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:13,050
not there example when there's no one in

285
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:15,388
<font color="#CCCCCC">your home it can do chores like remind</font>

286
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:17,910
you of appointments help the kids get

287
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:19,139
their lot get to school on time and it's

288
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,550
got other skills so it's obviously

289
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,009
learning how to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools in your</font>

290
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,829
home where you keep things what you have

291
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:29,180
available and also what you've told that

292
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:32,160
it can do and what it can do right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

293
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,079
maybe you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen all these videos of</font>

294
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,170
DARPA challenges of robots failing at

295
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,000
doing physical things but athletic robot

296
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,500
physical competitions like athletic

297
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,439
competitions are a big part of where the

298
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,209
now is used now and why that's important

299
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:47,040
is people are developing the now they're

300
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:49,109
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> it better giving it abilities to</font>

301
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,160
climb ladders get over stairs lift

302
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:54,870
heavier objects run sprint these are

303
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:59,670
things is now is becoming able to do

304
00:11:54,870 --> 00:12:02,279
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so what does this come back to</font>

305
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:04,290
security so well say an intruder using

306
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:06,779
these earlier vulnerabilities gets into

307
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,639
your robot now the intruder has an

308
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:10,620
actual physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> presence in your home</font>

309
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,939
and you might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it it's just</font>

310
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,579
a robot the robot you have in your

311
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:16,019
everyday life you're used to it this

312
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:18,179
robot while going about its chores that

313
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:19,920
you told it to do it might have access

314
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:21,300
to sensitive information because it's in

315
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,979
your house it's your private space you

316
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,349
just leave your credit card bill on on

317
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,569
the table but<font color="#E5E5E5"> now can take videos</font>

318
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,410
snapshots send it back to you over Wi-Fi

319
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:32,939
I can listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> in on private conversations</font>

320
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,019
maybe you have a business meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

321
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:35,849
you're talking about sensitive medical

322
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:39,030
information that you don't want you know

323
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,860
your employer getting hold of and

324
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the robot can because</font>

325
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,760
it's Wi-Fi connected it can put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

326
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:47,430
youtube or it can put it on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

327
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,790
can put snippets in other places when I

328
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:52,890
was in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Accra robotics competition in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> May</font>

329
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,349
this last year that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing they had</font>

330
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:58,140
was a robot<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would read Twitter to</font>

331
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:00,090
you you can respond back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> robot</font>

332
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,970
about the tweet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and post your response</font>

333
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:05,370
online so even if it's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> accident</font>

334
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:08,400
something can happen where you know the

335
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:10,350
robots thinks it wants you wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

336
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,540
tell it a tweet and then puts it online

337
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,640
so you never know when<font color="#CCCCCC"> or what it might</font>

338
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,040
say or<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you know maybe you have</font>

339
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,600
cats or dogs used to them coming you

340
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">know to say hi to you while you're in</font>

341
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,610
the washroom what if the robot comes in

342
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,170
with its<font color="#E5E5E5"> RGB cameras in a Wi-Fi</font>

343
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,640
connection and now there's a

344
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,349
seven-second vine of you peeing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

345
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:32,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet I don't know this stuff is</font>

346
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:33,540
possible um in addition observation

347
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,160
those security monitoring it's not

348
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,540
far-fetched so now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually sold as</font>

349
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,920
a tool that you know when you're away

350
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,410
from your home you can see if there's

351
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,449
any intruders check on your kids or your

352
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,420
nanny by using it as a monitoring

353
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:47,100
platform and as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

354
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,410
learned how to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> people trust it it</font>

355
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,090
can talk it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> interact socially and we</font>

356
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,560
can use all those social engineering

357
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:57,240
tricks that you might know just from

358
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:59,520
security so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes it's even an</font>

359
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,410
accident<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what you want to row watch</font>

360
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:05,670
you they're not they don't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

361
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:07,829
choices yeah but as a joke I mean maybe

362
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:10,079
the robot could be programmed maybe by

363
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:12,000
malware by an intruder to pull a blanket

364
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,800
over itself it overheats it will it can

365
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,240
catch on fire there goes your house

366
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,270
hundreds of thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars of</font>

367
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,570
property damage just with a Wi-Fi um in

368
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:24,870
attack but now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the robots cozy mix</font>

369
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:27,270
everyone cozy we talked a bit about

370
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:29,760
social engineering and well it's

371
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:31,350
familiar in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security field maybe it</font>

372
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,270
sounds a little crazy that a robot can

373
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:36,000
socially interact but this is actually

374
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:37,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">an interesting way a little a new</font>

375
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,620
emerging field of research that shows

376
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:42,110
how robots can you know interactive

377
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,700
people socially affect what they think

378
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:47,040
for example research<font color="#E5E5E5"> even just at the</font>

379
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">University of Manitoba here has shown</font>

380
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,649
that robots will people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will just tend</font>

381
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,240
to follow what

382
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:53,740
robots tell you to do if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that robots</font>

383
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,509
helping you train at home it might be

384
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">like yeah just three more sets three</font>

385
00:14:55,509 --> 00:15:00,490
more sets you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it you you know you</font>

386
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:03,269
might pull a muscle<font color="#E5E5E5"> injure yourself time</font>

387
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:06,129
off work you have work comp problems

388
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:08,170
workers comp there's computational

389
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:10,540
models for deception what this does is

390
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:13,179
people have made models that can for the

391
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:15,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">robot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn if it should deceive how</font>

392
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:16,720
it should deceive and they've shown that

393
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:18,670
with the repeated interactions for

394
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,379
example over your everyday life you know

395
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,029
every morning you're reading the paper

396
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:24,879
you chat with the robot<font color="#E5E5E5"> talks about the</font>

397
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:26,410
news it can learn how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deceive it can</font>

398
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,499
learn you know what will trick you and

399
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:31,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">what won't and thus it can you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font>

400
00:15:29,499 --> 00:15:33,670
might catch it tampering<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the carbon</font>

401
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:36,369
monoxide sensor in your house and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

402
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">is oh I'm just doing a check</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

403
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:40,720
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure this works fine nothing</font>

404
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:43,899
wrong these<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of things it can do</font>

405
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,689
social manipulation for example if

406
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:49,059
there's a husband and a wife and maybe

407
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:50,230
they're having<font color="#CCCCCC"> an argument it's been</font>

408
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:52,149
shown that if the robot takes a certain

409
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,259
side for example agreeing with one or

410
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:55,870
the other like yeah you should totally

411
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:57,939
buy that sports car this can actually

412
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">affect how one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the people like the</font>

413
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:01,389
life might think of the husband and it

414
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,149
can you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> create all sorts of in-home</font>

415
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:06,399
social problems and what's interesting

416
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:08,019
is if it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show them that</font>

417
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,540
people even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though we interact with it</font>

418
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:12,519
as a person we don't we still think in

419
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,439
some level it's just a robot so maybe

420
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,970
when we find an epic snooping in our

421
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:17,920
credit card records or carbon monoxide

422
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:20,019
along we go well it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a robot it's</font>

423
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a bug something weird</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we let it</font>

424
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:24,399
off the hook more<font color="#E5E5E5"> often so if an</font>

425
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,720
intruder gets into your<font color="#E5E5E5"> home he might</font>

426
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">have like a get-out-of-jail-free card</font>

427
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,870
and finally we also have instances<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

428
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:33,759
marketing so for example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ads on</font>

429
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">your computer maybe some malware gets</font>

430
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,389
buying puts a head on your robot you

431
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,759
come home one day and the robot says you

432
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:41,379
know your house is<font color="#CCCCCC"> so dirty if only you</font>

433
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,749
bought the newest model of the Roomba

434
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:46,329
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only five hundred dollars this is</font>

435
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:48,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">just intrusive it's it can convince you</font>

436
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:51,189
to do so but you don't want this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

437
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,420
house it's your private space so an

438
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:54,219
intruder doesn't have to be somebody

439
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">that wants to destroy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your house or</font>

440
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,860
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that pop-ups are intrusive a</font>

441
00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:01,459
robot that pops up<font color="#CCCCCC"> into your space while</font>

442
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:06,559
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something</font>

443
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:08,869
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also intrusive so in conclusion like</font>

444
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,000
constant vigilance of check your

445
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:13,520
networks make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you buy these</font>

446
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">robots check how they're connected how</font>

447
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,809
you can secure them the other thing we

448
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:21,260
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention is that now is actually</font>

449
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:23,270
run on like it has a linux OS so

450
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,549
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you run on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> linux machine you</font>

451
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:28,029
can also run on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this robot so anybody</font>

452
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:31,639
who wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop it's not difficult</font>

453
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:34,159
and again robots introduce new exploits

454
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,630
into your home it's stuff that you know

455
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:39,470
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people buying these robots</font>

456
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:42,200
don't expect like if you have fancy room

457
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that actually laser your space to see</font>

458
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,730
what the most efficient path is they now

459
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">have technically like schematics of your</font>

460
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,820
home they know where the entrances are

461
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,730
they can see where different things are

462
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,710
placed that's intrusive so again please

463
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,090
like share this information talk about

464
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,669
it we definitely want to hear what

465
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,620
people have to say and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

466
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:03,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">my area research as I want to do</font>

467
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">security and robotics so please contact</font>

468
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:07,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us with any questions yeah so I</font>

469
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,860
guess yeah the final tickle is maybe

470
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're you don't see too many robots in</font>

471
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:14,209
your homes yet but social robots really

472
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,470
are just<font color="#CCCCCC"> around the corner so keep this</font>

473
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,200
in mind if you ever end up working for

474
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,399
security and robotics development so

475
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,220
feel free to<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact us if you have any</font>

476
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:25,899
questions and if you have questions now

477
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,899
maybe we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take them thanks</font>

478
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:47,799
do you have time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions great</font>

479
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:50,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay anybody want to ask anything robots</font>

480
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:57,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">are cool science fiction cartoons</font>

481
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:59,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gundams of medabots Cylons Cylons I mean</font>

482
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:05,980
my research but is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is a badass</font>

483
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:17,168
islands or inspiration I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

484
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:18,820
question so there's so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

485
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:21,309
start this conversation it's actually

486
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,559
difficult to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so we all know</font>

487
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:25,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">like Internet of Things you know you</font>

488
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:26,860
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thermostats and if somebody's</font>

489
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,570
able to mess with that while all of a

490
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,370
sudden your house is too warm or in

491
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,769
Winnipeg too cold and verse your pipes

492
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,750
like that's an issue same thing with

493
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:37,179
robots if somebody can get in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

494
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,919
these other devices are not secure and

495
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:41,320
they can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> through your system into</font>

496
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:44,529
your robot the robot just has so many

497
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:48,428
more opportunities<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mess up your space</font>

498
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:50,230
and and cause problems in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> home so</font>

499
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:51,669
Internet of Things it's the same

500
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,710
problems everybody's talking about it's

501
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:55,600
why we have problems with the vehicles

502
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,450
medical devices everything's starting to

503
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">get connected so for not taking steps to</font>

504
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,380
secure everything it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

505
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:04,779
something we're not securing anything

506
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,980
yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the Internet of Things</font>

507
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:07,960
is really promising at least for

508
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,399
robotics<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a lot of robot</font>

509
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,860
robotics problems are really really

510
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:13,268
<font color="#E5E5E5">tough so one of the easy ways around is</font>

511
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,979
if you have all these sensors already in

512
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:16,539
your house it's great you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the robot</font>

513
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,490
might have limited computational power

514
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:20,379
or sensing but you have a security

515
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,480
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your house you have the nest</font>

516
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,309
thermostat and it can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> these as extra</font>

517
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,320
sensors kind of connected and extend its

518
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:28,809
body into your house and it's just it

519
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,700
makes you know the robot able to do more

520
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:32,168
things and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people</font>

521
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,970
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in getting the robots</font>

522
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:37,929
into these networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto this internet</font>

523
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:39,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">of things and so um will be just hell</font>

524
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:42,520
yeah

525
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,500
and so any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these exploits to get</font>

526
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,629
control<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the robot or if you get into</font>

527
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,600
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of things and can get to</font>

528
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:52,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> robot then all these experts we saw</font>

529
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,750
physical social or otherwise become

530
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,730
possible so i think it's the Internet of

531
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,310
Things is cool it will definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

532
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:05,130
robots out I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it complicates</font>

533
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:05,129
the security issue any other questions

534
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:26,500
so what was it the thinkpad that was

535
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:28,060
part of it is they saw I think that's

536
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it was there is extra hardware</font>

537
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,929
software being put in yes there's a

538
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,910
recent uh maybe a year ago lenovo scam

539
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:36,880
where if you buy the cheaper lenovo book

540
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:38,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think um like what if I'm idea pads</font>

541
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,890
they had some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of key logger</font>

542
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,960
basically a<font color="#CCCCCC"> right in it was super fish</font>

543
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:46,000
or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't remember but it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

544
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,190
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge horrible thing and it was it</font>

545
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,530
had like a really I think I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

546
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,550
just a basic buffer overflow flaw and

547
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,040
that you could exploit and it was

548
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:55,930
documented and Lenovo claims they didn't

549
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,149
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's besides the point it is</font>

550
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,380
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are shipping robots you know</font>

551
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,660
just like computers to get the price

552
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,310
down they might take you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies</font>

553
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">money from companies to put their</font>

554
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:07,000
software on your robot via for marketing

555
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:10,570
or other purposes and then you get the

556
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,830
pop-up bot and maybe the companies don't

557
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,590
do is security checks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they should</font>

558
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:16,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">just like on current consumer computers</font>

559
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,879
and so there might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> AI don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

560
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,229
robots themselves will necessarily be in

561
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,300
home robots will be developed to be

562
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:24,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">malicious by any company but I think</font>

563
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,570
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will definitely start taking</font>

564
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,860
advantage of them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe not for</font>

565
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:32,790
physical harm but definitely for data

566
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:32,790
collection in private spaces why should

567
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:42,250
so one one thing we definitely have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

568
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,918
do before we do any of this research<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

569
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:46,960
ethics applications so like I said I'm

570
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:48,669
doing persuasive robotics trying to get

571
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,100
people real wats to make people<font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font>

572
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:53,890
their minds that that is an issue people

573
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:57,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">are like Skynet as soon as I say that</font>

574
00:22:53,890 --> 00:23:02,169
they start freaking out it's awesome

575
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:04,299
that's why I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it oh but you know</font>

576
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:06,760
it there are issues you have to be

577
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:09,280
developing things respectfully and

578
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,780
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the consequences which is</font>

579
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,090
why we're sort of doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk is</font>

580
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,678
unlike if I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this like what's</font>

581
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:17,530
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad things that could go</font>

582
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,419
wrong and it's scary so we definitely

583
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,428
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect ourselves to get ethics</font>

584
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:23,110
boards in so we have other people making

585
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:27,900
sure we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> correctly and</font>

586
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:30,580
trying to keep the issues down um no um

587
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,350
their boards that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are often</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but also</font>

588
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,789
check experiments for psychology

589
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:35,080
sociology all these other faculties at

590
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:36,520
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> University so we have these checks</font>

591
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,689
in place<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's brittany said there</font>

592
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to make sure we're doing things</font>

593
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:42,010
honestly that if there's a risk for harm

594
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:44,200
we give them like especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we do</font>

595
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,940
social stuff we often<font color="#E5E5E5"> give them free</font>

596
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,280
access to free counseling services on

597
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,720
campus and this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing so there</font>

598
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,570
are risks and it's just about being

599
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,460
aware of them but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

600
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,990
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as this becomes profitable in the</font>

601
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">house I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think they'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> born more</font>

602
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:00,159
companies developing them and are there

603
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,720
enough checks on those that's an

604
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting question and I'm not going</font>

605
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">to say whether you know more regulation</font>

606
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:07,389
mess regulation but this is something we

607
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,620
do at the university<font color="#E5E5E5"> but come on in to</font>

608
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:11,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">the consumer world it's a whole new</font>

609
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">ballgame so we haven't seen any legal</font>

610
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,918
issues yet which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of why we're</font>

611
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,720
doing this talk is preventative unlike

612
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:19,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">the planes airplanes medical devices</font>

613
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,100
right now we're being<font color="#E5E5E5"> very reactive so</font>

614
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,620
please forget this in the spotlight now

615
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:26,709
then things like I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cavalry and</font>

616
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:28,090
eff can have the ideas set in place and

617
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,860
already starting to work on it before

618
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:31,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem or some I know there's</font>

619
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:35,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">some security consulting companies here</font>

620
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:35,460
so you guys to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get on this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tube question</font>

621
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:45,139
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're not expecting it</font>

622
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:47,149
that was sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is especially</font>

623
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:48,830
with the now it can see in your home it

624
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:50,658
like we said it can walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to your</font>

625
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,580
bills and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this information a</font>

626
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:54,889
physical intrusion into your home at

627
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:58,250
least there's usually evidence there's a

628
00:24:54,889 --> 00:25:00,889
broken window there's a door knob that's

629
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,809
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> broken there's some visual</font>

630
00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:05,269
representation that something's happened

631
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:07,340
but a data intrusion that's the thing is

632
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:09,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you don't know you don't know what</font>

633
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,639
data people can get you don't know what

634
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,620
they saw you don't know where they were

635
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:15,649
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your house there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so many details</font>

636
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are just unknown so any meaning</font>

637
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:18,979
isn't that the scary point is the

638
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">unknown so I think the robots kind of</font>

639
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,929
blur the lines between physical and

640
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:26,029
digital so they have a physical presence

641
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:27,529
to get this I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're done so I'll</font>

642
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:29,509
just finish this up we have a physical

643
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:31,789
presence and transmit this information

644
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:33,919
digitally this information so it's kind

645
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:35,899
of a blurred line so whether one is

646
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,159
stronger than the other well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

647
00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:38,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that's a different debate because</font>

648
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:41,899
physical harm<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus maybe personal</font>

649
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,979
attacks slander identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> theft I'm not</font>

650
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:44,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> upon its greater than the other but</font>

651
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,610
the risks are there with robots maybe

652
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:48,219
for software there aren't physical risks

653
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:50,990
there's that if you steal information

654
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,970
information is stolen it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

655
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:55,149
personal social but robots can also

656
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:58,519
cause physical harm which is a whole new

657
00:25:55,149 --> 00:25:59,779
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> security concern so thank you guys</font>

658
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:01,879
for all<font color="#CCCCCC"> your awesome questions we gotta</font>

659
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:04,299
move will be around for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of</font>

660
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:04,299
weekend so
