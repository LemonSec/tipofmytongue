1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:07,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay good day everyone and I'll bore you</font>

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,059
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenges of system and</font>

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,099
network architecture segmented

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,530
architecture<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad wasn't in the title</font>

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,109
anyhow I'm speaking bad english so i

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,859
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be forgiven so anyhow it's all</font>

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:21,990
about segmentation so thank you Ron for

8
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:25,699
but yes I my security architect with

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">great Westlife some titles things and</font>

10
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:29,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually I'm lying doing everything from</font>

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,269
coding to architecture so today our

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:37,770
agenda agenda here we go I'll be better

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:40,440
sooner or<font color="#CCCCCC"> later yeah I didn't have</font>

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,090
enough time for beer so<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh basically our</font>

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,550
today's agenda is talk about

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,500
segmentation common challenges and

17
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,530
challenges will include physical logical

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,350
and communication challenges which might

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,289
one find interesting so we will talk

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,289
about it a bit and lesson learned so

21
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically this talk is based on</font>

22
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:04,019
experience that I've gone through for

23
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:07,798
lust or I have been going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through that's</font>

24
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:11,310
right English<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10-7 for last year and a</font>

25
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,560
half so let's jump into it so what is

26
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,750
segmentation and segmentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thank You</font>

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">captain obvious is an act of splitting</font>

28
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,820
network system application components

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,610
into segments wow that's all fancy words

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,639
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it means basically we</font>

31
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:30,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">are just introducing our infrastructure</font>

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">not as a flat ward but of a ward with</font>

33
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,929
some segments in it why we're doing it

34
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,689
and i'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it a little bit more</font>

35
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,759
but what we're doing it ha credit cards

36
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,119
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to put any</font>

37
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,030
names around that but most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the recent</font>

38
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,329
attacks were somehow connected to the

39
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:55,740
segmentation and you say how so for

40
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:57,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">example a lot of smart ladies and</font>

41
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,699
gentlemen's are putting everything on

42
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flat structure or infrastructure or</font>

43
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,079
network or whatever you call it but the

44
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,000
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that when somebody putting a</font>

45
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,639
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sales terminal on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,910
network where the end users are it might

47
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,890
be not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> good of idea so another</font>

48
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,930
thing in flight enter

49
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,420
payment systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> roll everyone was</font>

50
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,330
following her most of you was following

51
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,130
around like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh somebody huh clean like</font>

52
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah hacking and playing good luck but</font>

53
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:28,290
anyhow there is no proof no disprove

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,910
anyhow I in-flight entertainment system

55
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,090
actually should be isolated<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

56
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:36,870
according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best security</font>

57
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:40,890
industries practices moreover that's

58
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:45,110
kind of funny does anybody look into the

59
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:47,010
plane in system engineering how all

60
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,110
components are sitting there and

61
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,200
actually talking there is no way you can

62
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:56,610
control trust from the tcp/ip protocol

63
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:59,369
just just saying so anyhow<font color="#CCCCCC"> automation</font>

64
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:02,010
that's another talk and talk that's

65
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,370
another topic and I've made talk about

66
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,260
it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> POS</font>

67
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,290
with the same segments that their user

68
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,870
are now could you imagine automation

69
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,359
like some big bosses<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to check</font>

70
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,610
my line in real time I want this very

71
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,709
fancy report with the charts pies and

72
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:23,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">all these colorful things and of course</font>

73
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">I want to access</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from my laptop ok we</font>

74
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,048
<font color="#CCCCCC">can always do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but again are we</font>

75
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">providing any controls in between the</font>

76
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:33,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">boss's laptops and our I don't know</font>

77
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:36,750
chemical producing line maybe not maybe

78
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:41,489
yes but segmentation might help us there

79
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:45,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">to even even worse examples how about</font>

80
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:48,660
our water treatment plant protected by

81
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:52,200
home router yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably it's a bad</font>

82
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:55,170
idea but I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so and we're</font>

83
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,000
going back to our home networks so how

84
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,220
about home networks we are introducing a

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,079
lot of technologies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are allow us to</font>

86
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,400
stream something<font color="#E5E5E5"> from something and</font>

87
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're sitting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in your backyard</font>

88
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,940
everything is awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drinking</font>

89
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,970
beer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and your favorite music playing</font>

90
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,880
what holes are we opening by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Spotify</font>

91
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,230
actually introduced to our home network

92
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,039
that might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an interesting thing to</font>

93
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:19,469
look into the point is a yesterday talk

94
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:23,219
thank you ladies gentlemen<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

95
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:25,169
robotics how about<font color="#CCCCCC"> put our robot on</font>

96
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,250
different segments how about not

97
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:31,210
allowing them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

98
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:33,010
hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea so what kind of</font>

99
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,950
segmentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll be talking about a</font>

100
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:37,570
network and I already talked about

101
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:40,420
segments within the network so might be

102
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:43,120
a good idea to use the best practices

103
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:46,570
and separate our network segments for

104
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,930
example by use web<font color="#CCCCCC"> server should be i</font>

105
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:51,640
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> and dmz which stands for</font>

106
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:55,060
demilitarized zone<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh i pronounce it</font>

107
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,159
that's good and there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a web</font>

108
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,560
server segment the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ends that also can</font>

109
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,830
contain our proxy services that allow us

110
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:06,450
to go out so just this little idea about

111
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:08,680
segmentation systems how about systems

112
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:13,060
yeah it might be a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea to segment</font>

113
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:15,640
systems as well by functions maybe by

114
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,850
data classification even better by data

115
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:22,539
classification and functions just giving

116
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:25,450
an idea and applications yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

117
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">good talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rust and russ helps us</font>

118
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,260
with some things but how about if we are

119
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,630
decoupling application segments and

120
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,820
actually trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to secure each component</font>

121
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,190
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter communication between the</font>

122
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:39,370
component in certain way in order to

123
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:42,010
increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> our security so segmentation</font>

124
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,900
flavors and I call the traditional for

125
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,810
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lack of better term but really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

126
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,030
called perimeter protection and

127
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,830
basically when somebody is only

128
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,929
concerned about protecting perimeter and

129
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:56,469
putting everything behind the perimeter

130
00:05:52,930 --> 00:06:00,000
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to be secure and zero</font>

131
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:03,370
trust basically zero trust was

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,040
introduced<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Gartner's and they're</font>

133
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,010
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok all segments within our</font>

134
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,840
network shouldn't talk to each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

135
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:16,890
unless they're explicitly allowed to

136
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:19,239
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok good idea but as for my taste</font>

137
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:21,580
zero trust might be challenging<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

138
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:26,530
that Google implementing zero trust in

139
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:29,039
their data centers but the point is that

140
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:32,409
hybrid I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it would be the most</font>

141
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:34,750
adoptable approach for everyone and it's

142
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,760
a basically United granularity of zero

143
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,910
trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus simplicity of traditional</font>

144
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,840
segmentation and again depends on the

145
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,060
task

146
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,429
that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accomplish</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hybrid</font>

147
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,230
approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good one okay so we</font>

148
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,680
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these segments everything is</font>

149
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:53,650
great but how will make them talk to

150
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,900
each other or communicate we're doing it

151
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:58,840
by control points and what our control

152
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:02,380
points and when this term was introduced

153
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,479
to couple clients that was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm what</font>

154
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:09,240
it is so basically control points it's

155
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:12,550
some enforcing body that takes different

156
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,520
policies and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay a basically</font>

157
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,560
firewall would be the simplest control

158
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,400
point that<font color="#CCCCCC"> introduced least privileged</font>

159
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:24,610
access ah-ips intrusion prevention

160
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:27,400
system well pretty much introduce some

161
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:30,400
active content inspection and some kind

162
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,138
of contraction to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as well as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas</font>

163
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,570
but it won't be active it will be just

164
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:35,800
face it and other technologists so

165
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,620
basically right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we know that</font>

166
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,010
segmentation is certain sets of zones

167
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:44,289
with a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> system or application</font>

168
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,849
they're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to each other and in the</font>

169
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:48,490
way that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are talking there is some</font>

170
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:50,710
control point that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> enforced</font>

171
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:55,030
some controls on how they can talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

172
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:56,830
each other<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we know how to create</font>

173
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:00,010
our segmentation what might be

174
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:04,330
challenges associated with it so common

175
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:06,130
challenges from logical perspective when

176
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,190
one begins how granular one should be

177
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:13,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes I love this one my colleagues hated</font>

178
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:16,780
but try to be less personal as I can so

179
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,900
a more granular segmentation allows us

180
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:23,400
to be whoever control freak I am and

181
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:26,320
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my Valhalla there is a big con</font>

182
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:29,669
associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this with this business</font>

183
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:32,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">from operation and money perspective</font>

184
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:36,728
will be your biggest enemy i first go

185
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:39,429
with might not they well so ok let's

186
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:42,190
granular segmentation business is happy

187
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:44,410
until something happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> and are we</font>

188
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">risking our security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't know</font>

189
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:50,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">like I really that's my might be table</font>

190
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,130
rules I like them solo although so

191
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,599
anyhow and maybe compromise is a good

192
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,930
idea

193
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:01,060
so basically again when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking</font>

194
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:03,489
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a compromise let's use a hybrid</font>

195
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:06,040
one because business always<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to see</font>

196
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,650
let's save some money<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay compromise</font>

197
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,160
can allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but security folks as us</font>

198
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:13,990
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> would like to see more security so</font>

199
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,810
what we're going to do combine two and

200
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,490
some point we really need to segment our

201
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,729
data and say yeah there is absolutely

202
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:24,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">only white least kind of scenario loud</font>

203
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,860
so application a only can't talk to

204
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,610
application beyond certain set of ports

205
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:33,340
and protocols yeah that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome so</font>

206
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,880
what other challenges are there a

207
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:39,160
physical separation of underlying

208
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,860
infrastructure when is enough so right

209
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,410
now everybody like especially operation

210
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,810
folks who are not involved involved in

211
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:48,850
setting up servers and networks that are

212
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,890
like okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so my application a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doctor</font>

213
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,520
application be<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have no idea where it</font>

214
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:56,530
resides I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay cool</font>

215
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,540
from security perspective how are we

216
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:02,290
thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it oh damn we're sharing</font>

217
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:06,610
application in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> DMZ with our very</font>

218
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:08,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">high secure internal zone sharing</font>

219
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:11,440
hypervisor is a good idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think</font>

220
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:15,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">so especially recently we can escape I</font>

221
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:19,530
provides quite a few ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yes it's a</font>

222
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:22,300
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so another example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

223
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:24,610
network attached storage perfect we have

224
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,829
pretty much unlimited capacity if we

225
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:30,550
stuff it properly and continually grow

226
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:33,660
our cluster of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the storage so but what</font>

227
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:36,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens if someone will have control</font>

228
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:39,370
through less secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> segments over the</font>

229
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,800
storage yeah they potentially will have

230
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,930
access to our highly sensitive data so

231
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,550
second physical separation might be

232
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,500
considered but again with physical

233
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:50,020
separation there is a consideration of

234
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,060
big money coming in so we definitely

235
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">should should be mindful from</font>

236
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,400
architecture perspective or security

237
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,819
perspective I will provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and all</font>

238
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:03,430
right we have segments and now what yeah

239
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,950
we introduced our segmentation our

240
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:08,258
stakeholders are happy big bosses are

241
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:11,589
happy money seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be right</font>

242
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:14,919
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> but now we are trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement</font>

243
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:18,069
it and basically what we're trying to do

244
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:20,769
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so hey operation folks right now</font>

245
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:23,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">you need to really your network what I</font>

246
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:26,649
hate you okay fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this little bit</font>

247
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,869
segmentation crossed out that's that's

248
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:33,249
how they fail about segmentation all

249
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:37,059
these adventures but the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is</font>

250
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:40,600
just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very mindful about how you</font>

251
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:44,139
deliver this segmentation so yes it will

252
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,689
impact applications yeah that there is a

253
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:49,299
potential yeah I admit it but why we're

254
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:51,488
doing it the most important from and now

255
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:53,739
they or modern security team is say that

256
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:55,929
we're not doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because we're evil</font>

257
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:58,629
we're not like saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> like no don't do</font>

258
00:11:55,929 --> 00:12:00,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">that no we say yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do this please we</font>

259
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:02,649
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see business driving but we want</font>

260
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:07,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">to provide security for it that's that's</font>

261
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:12,789
a point so that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much a main</font>

262
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:14,639
idea to deliver to operation and system

263
00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:17,799
folks in order to implement it

264
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:21,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">enterprise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> white white listing that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

265
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:24,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">very good idea but really like who is</font>

266
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:28,869
from operation words here in the

267
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:30,939
audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whew so do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

268
00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:34,359
hundred percent what is your application

269
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:37,269
talking like what protocols what ports

270
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:38,889
okay that's great if if you do then

271
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:41,079
whitelisting would be a great approach

272
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:43,629
but I've seen systems that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> running</font>

273
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:45,939
on mainframes application were developed

274
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:49,209
20 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and nobody have a little</font>

275
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:51,759
idea what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> does Oh ftp yes we do use</font>

276
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:53,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">ftp would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it be ftp active oh I don't</font>

277
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,749
know would it be passive I don't know

278
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:57,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I need this application to work</font>

279
00:12:55,749 --> 00:12:59,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it collects reports and I need</font>

280
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:01,748
<font color="#CCCCCC">it right now and business will be</font>

281
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:03,549
crippled if we won't do that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> wyd</font>

282
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:07,499
listing is good when the infrastructure

283
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:11,039
is well documented and but sometimes

284
00:13:07,499 --> 00:13:12,999
unfortunately we need to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font>

285
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">blacklisting and say like what is</font>

286
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:18,789
potentially bad and then go from there

287
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:21,339
and convert<font color="#E5E5E5"> into something good or</font>

288
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:21,970
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessary blacklisting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is bad</font>

289
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:25,209
but I

290
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:27,939
no converting it to whitelist so and

291
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:31,628
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I already mentioned communication</font>

292
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:34,349
in the first part but yes how you build

293
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:36,819
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> segment's so most of the time</font>

294
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:39,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">enterprise already quite mature when</font>

295
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:40,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">they ask for like or they're coming with</font>

296
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,149
a do we probably need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to revisit our</font>

297
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,628
segmentation or<font color="#E5E5E5"> wow we didn't have</font>

298
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:48,759
segments let's build them so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

299
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:51,370
already business that works and it

300
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:53,079
relies on underlying infrastructure so

301
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,379
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we doing in order to accomplish</font>

302
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:58,839
it we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to be very mindful</font>

303
00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:03,790
and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said in very first sentence</font>

304
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:06,129
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the now what basically if we can</font>

305
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:08,769
somehow stand up our segmentation

306
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:10,810
without changing IP address operational

307
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:13,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">folks network folks everybody will be</font>

308
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:16,449
happy so it's very important to consider

309
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:18,939
this part if we can't stand up something

310
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:21,430
in parallel and most of the time it

311
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:24,939
could work it will still involve some

312
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:27,279
changes but at least usually when

313
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:29,649
network for example segmented<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

314
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">already some consideration around</font>

315
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:34,059
grouping systems together so right now

316
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,800
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand what policy will</font>

317
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:38,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">be applied to the systems and how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

318
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,779
want this system<font color="#CCCCCC"> to intercommunicate or</font>

319
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:43,300
communicate with<font color="#E5E5E5"> other systems so it's</font>

320
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:45,990
doable but don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> forget to communicate</font>

321
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:49,180
about it because like okay well cool

322
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:53,740
organization get ourselves like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> brand</font>

323
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:56,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">new amazing segmentation architecture it</font>

324
00:14:53,740 --> 00:15:00,370
looks brilliant it's cheap and<font color="#CCCCCC"> dirt up</font>

325
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:04,420
and beautiful so let's let's implement

326
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:05,920
it and then actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> executive team for</font>

327
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,110
God's to communicate it down to the

328
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,120
trenches like yeah we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be secure</font>

329
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:13,899
everything is awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody knows it</font>

330
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,600
down in the basement I'm related to

331
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:18,699
myself and then it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

332
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,610
segmentation came up where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> came up</font>

333
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:24,609
from what are we doing what is it I'm

334
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:28,569
scared and lonely and whatever so yeah

335
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:32,730
just try to communicate it properly<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

336
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:35,059
will help a lot so a another logical

337
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:37,069
challenges this yeah

338
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:39,169
technology implementation and segment

339
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:41,689
boundaries or control points yeah we

340
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:43,669
wanted all and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now that's an</font>

341
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:45,379
amazing business approach how much it

342
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:47,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">costs I don't know then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want it</font>

343
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:51,829
but could<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it less yeah sure now</font>

344
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:54,289
we want it all<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay perfect but we also</font>

345
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:56,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to understand and consider what the</font>

346
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:57,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">impact of technologists okay let's put</font>

347
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:00,439
like just just a little thought

348
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:01,909
experiment let's put IPA okay let's put

349
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:05,238
firewall of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course everybody loves</font>

350
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:07,909
firewalls let's put IPS sure let's do it

351
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:10,399
all on inbound traffic let's put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a web</font>

352
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:13,399
application firewall sounds good let's

353
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,189
put an outbound do p what else what else

354
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,259
we can stick let's put some unified

355
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:21,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">something-something security solution on</font>

356
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:23,989
top of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool so what do we have</font>

357
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:28,009
at least tomatoes we have five

358
00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:29,209
inspection points and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine they</font>

359
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:31,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">are not implemented in one device</font>

360
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:34,008
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to be</font>

361
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:36,619
mindful of vendors no vendors look

362
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:38,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">walking and all that perfect so we have</font>

363
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:40,339
five different vendors five different

364
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:42,489
technologies every of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> technologies</font>

365
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:45,109
actively sits in line grab the packet

366
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:47,269
deciphers it or disassembles it or

367
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:49,789
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the word will be dis exit to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

368
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:53,029
prefer more biological terms so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

369
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:54,909
then looks inside so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm good slap</font>

370
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:57,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">it back together throw on the wire</font>

371
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:59,869
inspect it we're safe so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

372
00:16:57,859 --> 00:17:01,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">about five technologies yeah every</font>

373
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:07,699
vendor will say oh we're operating in

374
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:10,730
wire speed<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool so then I shouldn't</font>

375
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:12,740
shouldn't consider any delays any

376
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:16,490
latency no no we're preparing in wire

377
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:18,740
speed<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm fine oh and by the way</font>

378
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,809
our IPS all actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> can grab the file</font>

379
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,149
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're downloading this 20 meg PDF</font>

380
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:25,849
and send to some analyzer in the cloud

381
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:28,549
that actually will deploy a detonated

382
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:30,709
collects response of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> API sin certain</font>

383
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:32,360
operating systems analyze it collect the

384
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,669
data sends it in the report and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

385
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,830
allow you to block or non bloggers what

386
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:40,789
wait a second and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all in wire speed</font>

387
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:42,619
I doubt<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be very mindful</font>

388
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:45,200
how we implement these technologies and

389
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:46,770
yes it will impact latency it will

390
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,660
impact performance and

391
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:51,389
end of the day it will impact business

392
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,240
so that's somebody needs to be mindful

393
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:57,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it and how to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> technology working</font>

394
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">together and optimization wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> English</font>

395
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:02,250
sorry I'm not it's not my first language

396
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:05,340
but anyhow do you want some encryption

397
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:07,140
with your meal yes please so now you

398
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,560
imagine all these five technologists are

399
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:12,210
inspecting our traffic let's add some

400
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,940
twisted let's encrypt every single

401
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,520
communication over a network where

402
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,810
secure encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christian is cool</font>

403
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,129
employ your encryption is cool it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

404
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:23,610
circles but it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> applied</font>

405
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:25,500
properly and now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to the ladies</font>

406
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,330
of technology we also need our crypto

407
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,240
processor working very hard and sweating

408
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:33,120
so we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a package we decrypt it</font>

409
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,280
inspect it encrypted put on the wire<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

410
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,929
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's happening how on the wire</font>

411
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,970
speed no it doesn't so pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much there</font>

412
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,680
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple things that we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

413
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:47,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">very mindful where I'm when we are</font>

414
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:49,770
implementing technologies so physical

415
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:51,600
challenges and somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> say physical</font>

416
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,790
yeah usually like from architectural

417
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,469
perspective we're designing conceptual

418
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,020
phase when we're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> around and</font>

419
00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:00,480
asking all big bosses what we why they

420
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">really want in terms of non-functional</font>

421
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,130
requirement then we're finally talking

422
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:06,719
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this specialist security</font>

423
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,970
professionals what their functional

424
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,680
requirements then eventually we're doing

425
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,470
logical architecture and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are coming</font>

426
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:16,080
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to physical architecture so what</font>

427
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,460
the challenge is under the physical

428
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,919
architecture again understanding the

429
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:22,500
flows how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's flowing like usually when</font>

430
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,840
you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> has an architect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you put one big</font>

431
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,990
block and say like yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> our zone</font>

432
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">one or segment one another block segment</font>

433
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">two this communication allow this not</font>

434
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,110
when you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the physical</font>

435
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:37,590
nightmare it's like yeah there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty</font>

436
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:40,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">seven blocks three thousand flows I'm</font>

437
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:43,260
done so<font color="#E5E5E5"> translating it into the proper</font>

438
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:45,479
flows from logical to physical would be

439
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,879
challenging control points and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

440
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,130
stressed a lot and enough I think about

441
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,990
control points so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

442
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,670
mindful about placement and actually

443
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,840
yeah we are connecting different

444
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:59,460
interfaces so that might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very</font>

445
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,689
daunting and challenging task just to

446
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,900
translate logical

447
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:06,870
into the physical deployment of control

448
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:10,530
points staging staging another one like

449
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:13,050
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want your progress project to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

450
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:15,420
successful we<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to stage</font>

451
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,790
it properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and staging will impact</font>

452
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,560
physical face the most at my taste

453
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:23,520
somebody might disagree and i'll be

454
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:26,159
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to argue so we pretty much don't</font>

455
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,960
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cripple down the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business so we</font>

456
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,330
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stage it properly for business</font>

457
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,010
to do their thing and for us as<font color="#CCCCCC"> eighty</font>

458
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,980
folks to have their money to play with

459
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:38,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">our toys testing that's another thing</font>

460
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,230
it's quite an interesting concept and

461
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,700
it's very important did we break

462
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:44,310
something we're introducing controls

463
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:48,960
we're changing<font color="#E5E5E5"> ap addresses testing is a</font>

464
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:51,659
big thing there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> laugh all</font>

465
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that need to be done we can we do</font>

466
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">business as usual and of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

467
00:20:53,790 --> 00:21:00,149
something goes wrong bosses are unhappy

468
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,190
so the lessons learned our lessons

469
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:04,410
learned out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is my</font>

470
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:07,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">three-point there is way more and I'm</font>

471
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:10,020
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share it afterwards but there</font>

472
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:12,389
is no one fit approach and every case is

473
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,970
unique but there are model that we

474
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:18,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually can use so we look into</font>

475
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:21,270
traditional model will you looped in 20

476
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,460
trust and we also looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> our hybrid</font>

477
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,110
model so something can be scrambled

478
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,890
together and pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much we can come up</font>

479
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:30,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a unique solution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for unique needs</font>

480
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:32,610
it must be balanced between<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

481
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:36,300
operation and business and again like

482
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:38,879
I'm here<font color="#E5E5E5"> representing security control</font>

483
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:41,100
freak that probably dies somewhere in

484
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,510
the battle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go to Valhalla but the</font>

485
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:47,639
point is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I definitely we definitely</font>

486
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,260
need certain listening to business there

488
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:54,150

00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:01,530
another company that he's frontline of

492
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:03,780

idea to<font color="#CCCCCC"> real life implementation is a</font>

497
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:15,748
long way so proper planning training

498
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:18,119
communication along the way are the key

499
00:22:15,749 --> 00:22:20,669
factors for success as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said like</font>

500

everybody in the company no<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter how</font>

page<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody needs to see why we're</font>

503
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,699
doing it and then you will get support

504
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:32,519
of it like oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you're not just</font>

505
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,369
trying to make our life harder there is

506
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,739
a hard face of our life but at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

of the day will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be all big happy family</font>

508
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:42,299
and segmentation will be our friend

509
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,179
that's what needs to be pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

510

delivered so thank you very much and

00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:53,639
minutes 30 seconds for questions and

513
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:56,399
here is my email address and this is a

<font color="#CCCCCC">questions question yes please</font>

516
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,929
ok the question was what is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hybrid</font>

517
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,530
approach in is there any open source

518
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:32,240
documentation so fortunately we have a

519
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:34,649
lot of approaches to the zoning or

520
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,720
segmentation I know there is no one

521
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:39,419
document it's basically my hybrid

522
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:43,290
approach I'm really thankful to call it

523
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:47,070
from securities or whatever it is right

524
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:49,500
now I'm sorry I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want to be</font>

525
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:54,000
disrespectful but I lost tract what it

526
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,950
is so basically a Christian and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

527
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,169
Christian parent should be here

528
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:00,030
somewhere around it's basically based on

529
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:04,169
the experience that we get through the

530
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:07,530
exercises from different companies and

531
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:10,590

00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:18,870
spirit I'm not taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> money for</font>

535
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:22,400

automated tools so most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools are</font>

541
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:53,390
based on some kind of visual support

542
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:57,260
such as vzo or daj or GID I'm sorry but

543
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:58,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">the point is that needs the National</font>

544
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,090
Institute of Standards have quite a few

545
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,830
document that you can derive your

546
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:06,520
information from and it will help to

547
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:10,280
plan for whatever needs to be drawn ah

548
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:20,360

<font color="#E5E5E5">any thoughts on canadian government</font>

551
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:28,990
segmentation thoughts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> god no no my</font>

552
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:33,320
thoughts about their guidance actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

553
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:36,500
did go over that and it looks relatively

554
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:43,429
decent and yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay in canada</font>

557
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:52,250
with federal government of United States

558
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:54,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">and again in East and other standards</font>

that are incorporated into Canadian

560
00:25:54,890 --> 00:26:01,720
standards so i can say that they're

561
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:05,870
better they're worse they're just common
