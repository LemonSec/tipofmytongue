00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:09,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">good day this as Ron mentioned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do work</font>

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,889
for university<font color="#E5E5E5"> of manitoba prior</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,320
he worked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> university of winnipeg</font>

4
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:15,480
where i experienced the deep freeze and

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,220
active directory and prior to that i

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,180
worked at University College of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,948
North in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the northern community the pop</font>

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so let's get going so I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

9
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,510
to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about what deep</font>

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,759
freeze is what it does and some of the

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,180
some of what Active Directory does and

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,380
how you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so deep freeze for</font>

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,910
those who<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it i'm sure</font>

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">most people know what active directory</font>

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,010
is but for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> who don't know what</font>

16
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,739
deep freeze does it saves a state of the

17
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,809
computer when you freeze it and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

18
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:50,160
restart the computer it returns to that

19
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:52,050
state so this this allows you to secure

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,690
a computer in a different manner than

21
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,459
normal so the audience<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

22
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,530
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this are those who might</font>

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,180
be considering implementing active

24
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,210
directory and deep freeze within their

25
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,339
environments I start objective today is

26
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,750
to understand how deep freeze interacts

27
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,580
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> active directory I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font>

28
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,409
with introducing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> benefits of both</font>

29
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,149
tools then we'll look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some of the</font>

30
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,970
issues that can arise and how they can

31
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">be prevented so we're going to first</font>

32
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,840
look at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons to use deep</font>

33
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,820
freeze<font color="#E5E5E5"> and after active directory so</font>

34
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,799
deep freeze can prevent computers from

35
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,289
remaining part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a botnet if they get</font>

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,930
if they get infected same thing with

37
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,450
viruses if you get a virus restart<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

38
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,189
computer it wipes out anything if the

39
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,170
system is compromised and some active

40
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:38,669
tools are left behind on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer</font>

41
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,979
once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> after restarts gone computers</font>

42
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">and public spaces can be secured in a</font>

43
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:46,289
manner so that user files information

44
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:49,710
login credentials things like that are

45
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,360
wiped out at the next restart this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

46
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,689
great for public spaces such as labs

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,450
thinning<font color="#E5E5E5"> University and if desired you</font>

48
00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:00,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">can give users local admin they can</font>

49
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,479
install software upon the restart once

50
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,850
again gone and then computers can also

51
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,818
be thawed remotely which is important

52
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,889
for what we'll discuss later on the

53
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">Active Directory those of you who don't</font>

54
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,819
know it can allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have unified</font>

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">huggins it allows it to see it can be</font>

56
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:19,569
set up so you're not having to have the

57
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:24,220
text go out each computer to create a

58
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:26,470
local login for for the users so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

59
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,450
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> for once again lab environments</font>

00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:40,239
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> behind I can also</font>

66
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,799
introduce things like single sign-on for

67
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,470
services such as email if you're using

68

71
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,140
management and couple that with SCCM

72
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,510
computer management becomes a whole lot

73
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,099
easier reboots imaging software installs

74
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,620
all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be managed from a remote</font>

75
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:01,750
location the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to organize</font>

computers and users into organizational

77
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,879
units is another great feature of Active

78
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,590
Directory no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also mentioned a CCM so</font>

79
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,500
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it it says for the System Center</font>

80
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,599
Configuration Manager I also mentioned

81
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,150
the CCM later which is client<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection</font>

82
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,858
manager so SCCM allows for management<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

83
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,169
computers<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> environment everything</font>

84
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:21,579
from installing software and giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> non</font>

85
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:23,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">admin users the ability to install</font>

86
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:26,290
software from a selection to imaging

87
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:28,690
computers remotely it's all made

88
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:33,190
possible by SCCM and this includes the

89
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:34,540
ability to force a reboot<font color="#E5E5E5"> from remote so</font>

90
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,190
some of the reasons to use the tools

91
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,349
together if you haven't already caught

92
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,299
on the with tools like SCCM you can

93
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:42,790
force that reboot<font color="#E5E5E5"> from afar couple that</font>

94
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:44,620
with deep freeze<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the computer can be</font>

95
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">returned to the most desirable estate at</font>

96
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,180
any given time and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this can be useful</font>

97
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,349
in multiple situations a good example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

98
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,599
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if you're monitoring your</font>

99
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:54,548
network and you happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to notice that</font>

100
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,619
there's some pretty sketchy data coming

101
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:58,569
from a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the computers in a lab</font>

102
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,910
across campus instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sending out a</font>

guy go all the way there check it out

104
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,019
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> push out a notification to the</font>

105
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:06,760
users say hey two minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from now</font>

106
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:08,650
commuters going to restart all your data

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,888
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone please save anything you</font>

108
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:14,440
have to an external flash drive and I

109
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:16,239
move to another location reboot the

110
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,010
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> deep freeze takes care of that</font>

111
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,048
wipes out anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be on</font>

112
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,060
there so if the users had installed

113
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:24,609
stuff got somehow<font color="#CCCCCC"> breached the security</font>

114
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,560
of the local machine you're not you

115
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,970
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be as worried about it</font>

116
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,290
now what<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go wrong with introducing</font>

117
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,139
deep freeze into an Active Directory

118
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,699
environment so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look Active</font>

119
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,949
Directory in SCCM form a very stable

120
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:38,840
environment if part of CCM is deleted

121
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:40,610
from a complete from a computer if you

122
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,830
have the group policy enabled<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll</font>

123
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,199
force it back back onto the computer so

124
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:47,270
to rebuild itself the next time at the

125
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">next and that runs my active directory</font>

126
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,680
uses a token based system to ensure the

127
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,229
computer is connected to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain</font>

sorry the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same computers that we're</font>

130
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:01,880
connected initially by the admin so it

131
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,570
uses a pass or two sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> referred to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">now it's by default one month that token</font>

133

must<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow the machine to make any</font>

148
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,620
permanent changes such as adding data to

149
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:45,229
the machine applications that stuff

150
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,300
background security keys anything you

151
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:50,990
might want to do you have a thought make

152
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,580
that change then refreeze up and deep

153
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,410
freeze can be customized leave areas of

154
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,870
the hard drive or even whole partitions

155
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:59,599
alone meaning if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to give a data</font>

drive for users that that they can save

00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:03,770
their stuff to you that is an option as

158
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,049
well now if a token change takes place

159
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,669
while the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer is frozen it</font>

162
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,900
when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Spree boot occurs you will get</font>

163
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:16,310
the error that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the trust relationship</font>

164
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,359
between this workstation and the primary

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:22,849
domain has failed now what this means is

166
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,340
that mismatch has occurred now the

167
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:28,010
easiest solution is to take it off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

168
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,888
the domain and to rejoin it so with deep

169
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:35,469
freeze already frozen what this means is

170
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:35,470
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to follow the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> machine reboot it</font>

171
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:43,030
and then take it off the domain go ahead

172
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:47,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and reboot it again we join it to the</font>

173
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:49,450
domain refreeze it rebooting it again

174
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:52,150
this takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long time now we can avoid</font>

175
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:54,039
this with deep freeze there is the

176
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,719
option to enable it to keep part of the

177
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,480
operating system that takes on that

178
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,550
token thought as our so that when the

179
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,460
token change occurs it does keep it upon

180
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:06,010
reboot<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I've experienced in the past</font>

181
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:08,560
where because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that wasn't enabled we</font>

182
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,719
lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of time we had to go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

183
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,280
take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what went wrong so you</font>

184
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,050
want to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have that</font>

185
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,059
enabled ahead of time so you don't

186
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,650
experience that in your environment I'm

187
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,880
a deep freeze also allows you to like

group policy updates stay on the

<font color="#CCCCCC">computer unfortunately</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have any</font>

191
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,770
for you today as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I would have</font>

really liked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do you want to</font>

193
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,870
thank you very much for taking your time

194
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:33,490
to listen to my<font color="#CCCCCC"> presentation I'd like to</font>

195
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:41,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">open the floor for questions if there</font>

196
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:43,720
are any are you up front here<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so the</font>

197
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,060
question is if it works with this level

198
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">encryption like BitLocker my</font>

199
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">understanding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is yes it does although</font>

200
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,320
there are some complications with how

201
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:56,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's setup you do have to pay attention</font>

202
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,120
to if that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be changing then I</font>

203
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,159
think deep freeze needs to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> an able to</font>

204
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:05,310
be aware of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> change that could be</font>

205
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,310
taking place somebody in the back there

206
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,260
um it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> place at the at the boot</font>

207
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,220
level so it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> freezing the</font>

208
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:33,610
whole operating system as a whole now if

209
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:36,760
you had a multiboot then it would only

210
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:39,219
you'd only be freezing the boot part of

211
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:44,010
Windows you wouldn't be freezing state

212
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:44,010
Linux you at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> very back</font>

213
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,680
yes any<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that is thawed could be</font>

214
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,470
compromised and that is something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

215
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,630
aware of so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lab you</font>

216
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,330
might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a d partition for data</font>

217
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:10,310
storage that you leave thought now if an

218
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,560
infection occurs on that partition in

219
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,329
theory<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes it would continue to remain</font>

220
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,829
there because you reboot<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows gets</font>

221
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:18,820
restored to the state but that<font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font>

222
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,820
partition does not

223
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:30,150
I'm not that I'm aware of but they're

224
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,490
always expanding their services so it's

225
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,500
perfectly possible I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

226
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,670
surprised if there isn't one I wouldn't

227
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">be surprised if we see one in the future</font>

228
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:55,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">um well more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than anything it's just my</font>

229
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,290
examples apply more to universities when

230
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,240
I mentioned labs things like that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

231
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,730
know has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> used for corporations has</font>

232
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,270
also been used for things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like internet</font>

233
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:08,790
cafes because it allows you to manage

234
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:11,460
your entire cafe all at once business

235
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,680
level I definitely see applications for

236
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,390
it but you do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be aware that</font>

237
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,670
because it freezes the state of the

238
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,410
computer data loss occurs upon reboot

239
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:23,699
which can also mean data loss occurs

240
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:27,089
upon a unexpected<font color="#CCCCCC"> shutdown things like</font>

241
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:29,100
that so it is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how</font>

242
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:32,310
beneficial it is to the average

243
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">corporate environment very special per</font>

244
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,540
case that is yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> point-of-sale</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font>

245
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,350
it would be I think it'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> really good</font>

246
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:43,110
you do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be careful that if if any</font>

247
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:46,110
of those change any of the transactions

248
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:50,130
that take place rely on remaining local

249
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:52,590
to the to the the POS system then that

250
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,810
does get wiped out so it'd be something

251
00:10:52,590 --> 00:11:01,490
to be careful of I've maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> even use</font>

252
00:10:54,810 --> 00:11:01,489
using a network drive then go ahead

253
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:22,050
well SCCM opens the door for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

254
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,910
the the software installation stuff like

255
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,790
that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example you can create</font>

256
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:29,569
essentially an app store for users to be

257
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:32,959
able to go in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and grab the the</font>

258
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:35,100

it compared it to novell the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bell you're</font>

looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> console one everything's</font>

265
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,150
right up front you look at Active

completely

271
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,589
um I'm actually not certain how they

00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,470
lock down<font color="#E5E5E5"> their configuration file it's</font>

273
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:20,270
something i've never actually researched

274
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:22,130
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something now I'm gonna have to</font>

275
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:28,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">go home and take a look into so thank</font>

276
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:28,270
you any other questions

277
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,540
sorry I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't hear you at all</font>

278
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,980
yes if if a compromise takes place

00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">server-side or not on a nominal frozen</font>
