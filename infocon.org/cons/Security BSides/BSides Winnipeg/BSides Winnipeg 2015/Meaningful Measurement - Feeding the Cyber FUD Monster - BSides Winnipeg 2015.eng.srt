00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you a little bit about some of</font>

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,100
the cyber ridiculousness and media<font color="#CCCCCC"> hype</font>

5
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:18,870
you're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> laugh along this is meant</font>

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be a light talk and we're not going</font>

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to mention any 64-bit subsystems because</font>

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,340
my head will explode but those are

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,900
awesome by the way the technical field

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:33,329
here has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been amazing um this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came about</font>

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,858
from a UK Home Office survey that came

12
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,280
out talking about how do we measure

13
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:41,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">cybercrime right and of course I had one</font>

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,179
of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> seancody moments and when you're</font>

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:47,879
doing it all wrong and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

16
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,859
the result of it is is that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

17
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,218
measurements we have are done but first

18
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:55,710
a word um skull space as you know has

19
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,819
encountered a few challenges in the last

20
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,159
little while if you're not a member

21
00:00:56,819 --> 00:01:01,679
please consider becoming a member it's

22
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:05,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">really important I travel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all over the</font>

23
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:07,619
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these I talks</font>

24
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,530
large conventions small conventions

25
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,990
there is no other<font color="#CCCCCC"> community like the one</font>

26
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,350
in Winnipeg it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> fantastic it's so</font>

27
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,179
supportive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> edinboro I'm telling you</font>

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,210
the hackerspace there is like five

29
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:25,259
people and a Commodore 64 it's not

30
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:27,059
exactly fun or dynamic so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ended</font>

31
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,030
up in Edinburgh I worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this project</font>

32
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,960
with some great people like Brittany and

33
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:38,280
Zoe and anybody that left<font color="#CCCCCC"> securus in the</font>

34
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,079
first wave and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I have money on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,030
Christian<font color="#E5E5E5"> perrone's going to end up I</font>

36
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,990
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the security architect for</font>

37
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,390
mts will be retiring shortly so but

38
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,490
anyways information security and

39
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,100
zoolander go hand in hand because<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

40
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,439
is what it feels like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we all</font>

41
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,499
laugh but essentially we know what's

42
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,570
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so that was one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

43
00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:02,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">the things that I think really started</font>

44
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,380
to inform this opinion is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

45
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:06,840
measurement doesn't matter breaches

46
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,490
breach guys it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't matter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where it</font>

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,039
came from it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even matter how</font>

48
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,599
much they took but the bottom line is is

49
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,809
we're kind of playing a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit with</font>

50
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:18,599
gasoline and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't help</font>

51
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:21,630
bus okay Jennifer Baker she's fantastic

52
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,970
shoes by the way but she<font color="#E5E5E5"> went through</font>

53
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,819
this presentation that blew my<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font>

54
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">because when we boil this down it is not</font>

55
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">the users that are the problems like you</font>

56
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,069
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to blame them because you know we</font>

57
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,349
feel they should all have little helmets

58
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,599
on so they don't hurt<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves but the</font>

59
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:38,130
reality is it's the attackers that are

60
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,569
the problem it's the folks that are

61
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,000
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our networks right</font>

62
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:43,589
and when we really look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and and</font>

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,840
this is where i'm going to rag on a lot

64
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,870
of vendors you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

65
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about radware but the real um the</font>

66
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,549
real<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem that we have here is that</font>

67
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:55,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">the attacks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're seeing are really</font>

68
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:58,230
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from only really four places</font>

69
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,839
that's it this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> magic here and it</font>

70
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">feels like when you read these white</font>

71
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,650
papers and when you read<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

72
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,079
material that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are coming out of a lot of</font>

73
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,380
big companies it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> security is like</font>

74
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,480
oh my god it's so hard right but the

75
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,160
reality is is when we boil down the

76
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,819
numbers and this is from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the verizon</font>

77
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">data breach report we find 93.9 percent</font>

78
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,810
of our attacks our email attachments

79
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:25,350
emails with malicious links or drive-by

80
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,239
download that's it okay that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it so</font>

81
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:30,510
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some really interesting things</font>

82
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,549
to contemplate and then further on in

83
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,260
the gigantic report that they write in

84
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:36,680
such language that you can never copy

85
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,600
and paste it into any internal document

86
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,660
we find this little stat that look at

87
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,000
this the bad guys are<font color="#E5E5E5"> using these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CVEs</font>

88
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,519
over and over and over again<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what's</font>

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,650
the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> one mitigation against a</font>

90
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:55,139
known vulnerability<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's install the</font>

91
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:56,819
 patch<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah like this is</font>

92
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:58,739
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the kind of garbage that</font>

93
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,108
comes out and they're like no<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font>

94
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,090
you know a giant infrastructure and you

95
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:05,310
need log management and I'm not throwing

96
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,079
any of that stuff out<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an enterprise</font>

97
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,989
is a lot harder than small/medium

98
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,239
business but the bottom line here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is</font>

99
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,459
that the bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys are using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

100
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,519
 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> owning the same networks over</font>

101
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:21,810
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> over again why you might ask because</font>

102
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,820
of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here's Ian trumps</font>

103
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,710
mitigation strategy actually liquid

104
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,740
Indians mitigation strategy for

105
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">cybercrime</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's it just do those</font>

106
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,920
three

107
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,020
and it gets a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot easier because</font>

108
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,540
then you're the elves up on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

109
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,580
wall killing your orcs rather than

110
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,990
having the works come over and I love

111
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,760
this image<font color="#CCCCCC"> because that's what it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feels</font>

112
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that's what all the attacks are</font>

113
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,530
really doing and I loved it so much that

114
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,420
when I found this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

115
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">really funny that that little elven</font>

116
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,840
stick family there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to get</font>

117
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,669
overwhelmed by the cockroaches but I

118
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,640
think you guys are sharp enough even

119
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,500
after two days of presentations that you

120
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,530
get the analogy the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm</font>

121
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,900
trying to make here is that in 2011 they

122
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,630
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the online economy was worth</font>

123
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,669
eight trillion dollars ok let's assume

124
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,950
just for a moment it grew a little bit

125
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for in 2008 I think there's a</font>

126
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:17,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more internets out there now</font>

127
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:20,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so when we hear the 500 billion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

128
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:23,370
450 billion is being lost in cyber crime

129
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:26,159
let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of a collective</font>

130
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,950
breath and say yeah but there's like

131
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,360
eight trillion dollars in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2011 that was</font>

132
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">being made and I think there's probably</font>

133
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,890
a fair bit more here so lets them get

134
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,950
off a little bit of the hype machine at

135
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:40,530
that first stop and let's really look at

136
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:43,919
and boil down what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and it</font>

137
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:46,440
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> help when RSA says we suck okay</font>

138
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,349
RSA at the conference rolled out this

139
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,469
whole speech that security is so

140
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:55,350
difficult and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having such a really</font>

141
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:58,080
tough time with it and I call

142
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:00,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay because this little report that</font>

143
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,340
came out from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this company says take</font>

144
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,950
away those<font color="#E5E5E5"> damn administrative rights</font>

145
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,989
and now you're going to mitigate all of

146
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:09,300
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks right and I'm going to</font>

147
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">take you through a zero-day attack that</font>

148
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,919
was unleashed by the Israelis on an

149
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,300
infrastructure and show you that by

150
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,740
removing administrative rights the

151
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,660
attack would have been deleted<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font>

152
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,970
have been defeated so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font>

153
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,030
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that this gets no hype in the</font>

154
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:26,400
media why this doesn't sell<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

155
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:29,280
taking away administrative rights I will

156
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,719
build an app for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's called</font>

157
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,659
active directory you might have seen it

158
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">might have encountered it so why is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

159
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,120
happening to us why are our souls being

160
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:42,729
marketed to it's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this it's</font>

161
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,770
because security is big money<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

162
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:46,539
and what are the kind of numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

163
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:50,438
are using to sold us this bill of goods

164
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:54,248
all enterprise numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it doesn't</font>

165
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:56,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">even really impact or speak to small and</font>

166
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:58,539
medium businesses out there which are

167
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,479
about eighty<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of the GDP of a</font>

168
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:03,400
country eighty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so when we</font>

169
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:05,680
take this data<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we try and make sense</font>

170
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,628
of it we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of report and</font>

171
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,819
this is a really interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> report from</font>

172
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:12,580
a coffee<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it breaks down how much</font>

173
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:15,430
you know you can buy stolen records for

174
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,938
it's a very useful metric but it's being

175
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:21,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">used for evil okay it's being used for</font>

176
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:23,710
cyber insurance policies<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's the</font>

177
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:27,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one rule about a cyber insurance</font>

178
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:29,438
policy never pay it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out always find a</font>

179
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,659
reason why you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

180
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:34,059
so what they do is they take these

181
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:36,879
numbers that come out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> these in these</font>

182
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:39,339
actual reports and they mark them up by

183
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,199
whatever profit margin there is and

184
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:43,089
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much they charge you so if</font>

185
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,339
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a million credit cards</font>

186
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:47,409
million credit card transactions going

187
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">through your system per month your</font>

188
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:51,699
premium is going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on these</font>

189
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:54,279
stolen numbers okay supply and demand

190
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:56,469
it's simple economy and then we get

191
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:59,860
stuff like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that makes us feel even</font>

192
00:07:56,469 --> 00:08:01,990
worse okay because I gee<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wonder what</font>

193
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,399
product websense makes when they say

194
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,930
things like ninety nine point three

195
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,120
percent of malicious files used a

196
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:10,209
command-and-control URL which have been

197
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,219
used by one or more pieces<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hair so</font>

198
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:14,860
I'm like oh my<font color="#CCCCCC"> god okay so you're</font>

199
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:16,689
telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> me 40 or 50 IP addresses and</font>

200
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,520
pretty much i'm now going to get ninety

201
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:21,610
nine point three percent you know

202
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,198
tougher harder to hack so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why</font>

203
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm saying on these numbers</font>

204
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the bottom line is is that what</font>

205
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:30,490
you're trying to do is you're trying to

206
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:34,000
equate the cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that data breach in</font>

207
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:36,669
some sort of real number so that you can

208
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,698
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk to your management about</font>

209
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:43,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk and here's the problem right p</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nome</font>

210
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:46,089
says 201 bucks verizon says 58 cents

211
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:48,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay same data okay in the reports have</font>

212
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:50,139
a look at them that seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be I'm</font>

213
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,449
going to see a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a range all right</font>

214
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:54,760
now one of the problems is is this is

215
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">not being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> included okay what is not</font>

216
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,960
included here

217
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,790
the cleaning and the pizzas and all the

218
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,460
bottles of water that are put into the

219
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,980
war room post-breach<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but more</font>

220
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,529
importantly it doesn't count the class

221
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,230
action<font color="#E5E5E5"> suits why because there hasn't</font>

222
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:14,130
been any decisions yet on those or

223
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:15,930
damages awarded so bottom line is we

224
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,779
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how much a record is</font>

225
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,969
worth we just don't we can guess a

226
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:22,589
little bit but the bottom line here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

227
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:26,990
when you look at one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most famous</font>

228
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:29,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hawks which was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RSA they the the bad</font>

229
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:32,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chinese people they stole one record</font>

230
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay they stole the algorithm to</font>

231
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,870
generate those RSA token numbers one

232
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,870
time password and then they hacked

233
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:42,300
Lockheed Martin<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and stole all</font>

234
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,460
the plans for the f-35 and a Predator

235
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,219
drone and that rat that went off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

236
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:49,380
runway in China so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point is is if</font>

237
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,300
you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about attributing a</font>

238
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:55,020
dollar value how much was that one

239
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:57,270
record that got stolen from RCA it well

240
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,970
it was worth probably the entire cost of

241
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:02,310
the intellectual property of the f-35 so

242
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:06,150
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that make any sense at all I don't</font>

243
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:08,849
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does so what I want to do is go</font>

244
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:12,480
through a few attack concepts with our

245

<font color="#CCCCCC">security like all doctors and lawyers</font>

249
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,439
out there I want to go through a few of

250
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,779
these attacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just kind of you know</font>

251
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,750
maybe deconstruct them a little bit so

252
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:35,310
we've got probes and scans up first all

253
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:37,320
right now I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy safety</font>

254
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,510
commissioner Keith Squires who decided

255
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">to roll out the fact that there's been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

256
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:44,550
ten thousand fold increase in cyber

257
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,370
attacks as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result of the NSA data</font>

258
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:51,630
center that was built in his particular

259
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:53,820
County um these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not attacks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

260
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,560
back in nineteen<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety nine there was</font>

261
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,630
this dude that scanned in network got

262
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,550
hauled up on charges for Computer Fraud

263
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,709
and Abuse Act and is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it turns out a</font>

264
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,170
funny story you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do five grand</font>

265
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:06,569
worth of damage<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end mapping</font>

266
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,370
someone doesn't really fit that five

267
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,510
thousand dollar I mean you could end map

268
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,920
the out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

269
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,330
but you're still<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do five</font>

270
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,040
thousand dollars worth of damage so it's

271
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,140
not attack according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Computer Fraud</font>

272
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,790
and Abuse Act so all this cyber flood

273
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,220
that we hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the millions of</font>

274
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:22,290
attacks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going on there like you</font>

know Alex running a script to see what

<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of services you have open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's</font>

277
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:29,100

service stock you know what this was

304
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,920
this was shitty passwords and the bad

305
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,300
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> were in there for 28 days and</font>

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,219

310

out of their victim but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom line</font>

311
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,160
is they've already gotten inside the

312
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:46,230
organization so when you hear these kind

313
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,459
of things it's like hmm I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

314
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,730
can a distributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> denial-of-service</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to say none bullshitty so</font>

318
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:02,910
then we get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> brute force attacks</font>

319
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:05,190
okay and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

320
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that brute force attacks are really</font>

321
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,330
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two things one you putting</font>

322
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,550
ports out on the internet with no

323
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:15,090
filtering and no access control lists ok

324
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:18,270
or not hiding them behind VPN or to my

325
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:20,820
personal favorite air whether the Ashley

introduced root root seemed to be pretty

331
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:37,509
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> and really do I have any sympathy</font>

332
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:39,670
no because here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the deal if you're</font>

333
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:41,170
this colossally stupid and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm pretty</font>

334
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's nobody in this organization</font>

335
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:46,810
that is building infrastructure like

336
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:49,779
this for Hillary Clinton no less I think

337
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:52,449
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably good bro okay because</font>

338
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:54,670
that's just you know complete negligence

339
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:57,128
now this next slide I'm going to say is

340
00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:01,420
a little bit controversial so I'll go

341
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:03,670
through it in some detail<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I i</font>

342
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,069
maintain<font color="#CCCCCC"> wordpress sites our company</font>

343
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:08,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintains wordpress sites</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i spend a lot</font>

344
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:10,420
of time patching stuff actually I spend

345
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:14,379
a lot of time buying beer for Theo who

346
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:18,009
patches stuff because this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

347
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:20,680
it seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> every time we go towards</font>

348
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:22,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">WordPress it's getting owned or being</font>

349
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,810
used in some sort of distributed denial

350
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:27,609
service attack okay now I I don't know

351
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,290
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> Drupal's any better or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything like</font>

352
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,449
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only reason I say that as I</font>

353
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:33,519
heard it over<font color="#E5E5E5"> coffee once and wants a</font>

354
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:35,439
bunch of web developers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point</font>

355
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,029
here seems to be is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that WordPress has</font>

356
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:39,160
causing us a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of grief out there</font>

357
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:41,410
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not what being patched and</font>

358
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,870
updated particularly well and it's also

359
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,160
built on a zillion plugins where you

360
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,300
know the first time the guy wrote the

361
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,040
plug in there might have been a few

362
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,660
vulnerabilities in it but then he fixed

363
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,579
it and patched it and then you know

364
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> took over a fork of it and</font>

365
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:54,550
then by the time you're done you don't

366
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,620
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what up to date software is</font>

367
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:58,540
anymore that's what the problem is I

368
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,699
mean WordPress right now is probably

369
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,560
 up more than backup exact and

370
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:06,500
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty up</font>

371
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:09,140
so why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a real problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because we</font>

372
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear and this is why patching and</font>

373
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,470
updating is something that is common

374
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,360
theme and something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

375
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,580
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pound over your heads because</font>

376
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,560
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the deal I was down at the sands</font>

377
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:22,130
Orlando conference and this came out

378
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,779
good old murals Alrich came out and he

379
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,360
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this vulnerability right</font>

380
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:28,550
HTTP is exposed if you're running

381
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,730
internet information server so help you

382
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:33,920
God but apparently twenty-two percent of

383
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,620
the internet runs internet information

384
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,469
server the deal here was is this could

385
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,960
be leveraged into remote code execution

386
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:44,630
which by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nineteenth of April was for</font>

387
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:47,270
sale on underground forum 12,200 US

388
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:49,520
dollars take it away home today a remote

389
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:52,130
code exploit for this particular

390
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:55,460
vulnerability so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue here is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

391
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:58,790
Microsoft issued a patch on April 22nd

392
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,800
so 19 to 20<font color="#E5E5E5"> seconds while I'm the last</font>

393
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,170
guy at bsides so I can't do math right

394
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,120
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right that's a few days but the</font>

395
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,370
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is that we got a rapidly patch</font>

396
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,860
these machines because here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

397
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:12,800
cyber<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mountain moment folks is</font>

398
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:15,680
people say oh I've got machines and like

399
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">rule whatever stand and you know what</font>

400
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,120
they'll never get attacked because<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

401
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:22,400
long do you think it takes to find every

402
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,230
single vulnerable machine about the same

403
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,870
time it<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes to learn church history</font>

404
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:29,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay five minutes you can scan the</font>

405
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:31,790
entire ipv4 address space using some

406
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,280
tools and find those vulnerable servers

407
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,740
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that somehow geographic</font>

408
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,439
proximity to you know exploit is

409
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,290
complete horseshit and every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I hear</font>

410
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,680
it I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to punch somebody how we</font>

411
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:49,370
doing good<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how's the swear words</font>

412
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:53,150
per second<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah well we're on to</font>

413
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:55,730
fishing so that'll be fun so phishing

414
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:59,779
attacks right number one criminal attack

415
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:02,300
vector<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so why do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we put an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email</font>

416
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:04,220
server alone out there on the internet

417
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,859
with no filtering in front of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

418
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,260
this is a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is a problem</font>

419
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">because our users click on that's</font>

420
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,520
all they do all day<font color="#CCCCCC"> long click on</font>

421
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:14,839
and the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that some people send</font>

422
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,639
them stuff that they shouldn't really

423
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,708
click on and can be in

424
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">be an email for instance or it can be</font>

425
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:22,160
social networking or it can be a whole

426
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,750
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different things so here's one</font>

427
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,430
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest problems that we have is</font>

428
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,040
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a major breach you might have heard</font>

429
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:31,070
of it right and what does the White

430
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,020
House come out with like five basic

431
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,510
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we probably are already</font>

432
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,180
doing if we're at bsides and you know if

433
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:41,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you're not at bsides then</font>

434
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:43,970
you're probably working for mts but the

435
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:46,580
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is is that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is easy</font>

436
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,930
to do okay okay granted<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-factor</font>

437
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,250
authentication is a little bit more

438
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,990
difficult especially in some

439
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,880
infrastructures but this is small

440
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,830
business go and see my duo friends

441
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,110
they'll put two factor authentication in

442
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:59,929
front of any of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this</font>

443
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,699
is not impossible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and what what</font>

444
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll translate for you from White House</font>

445
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,180
speak strengthening controls for

446
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,730
privileged administrative users actually

447
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:10,370
means remove administrative rights for

448
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:13,880
your users<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right followed quickly by</font>

449
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:16,429
the FBI<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's use language such as</font>

450
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,620
social engineering or computer intrusion

451
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:21,080
techniques ok computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> intrusion</font>

452
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,689
techniques who here has an anti computer

453
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,580
intrusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> to technique device no one</font>

454
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,590
what they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have said is an email</font>

455
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,560
with a damn link or an attachment on it

456
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,850
ok so again the FBI here is not really

457
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,000
helping us because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not giving us</font>

458
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:37,280
clear and concise threat information

459
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,050
about what the bad guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing they</font>

460
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,000
use this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of verbal garbage all</font>

461
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,620
right now to be honest the type of

462
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,870
attack that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to protect</font>

463
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,750
you from here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically a guy like</font>

464
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:49,669
Ron picking up the phone calling you and

465
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:52,520
asking you for money that's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

466
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:54,890
level of sophistication going on here so

467
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,620
we move on to drive-by download all

468
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:59,570
right now drive-by download increasingly

469
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,840
being used by<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybercrime exploit kits</font>

470
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:05,659
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> honestly this is because you're not</font>

471
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,740
patching your websites and the bad guys

472
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,360
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking them over and they're using</font>

473
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">the real host all sorts of malware and</font>

474
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,679
push out all sorts of spam so if again

475
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,689
we go back to our patch management piece

476
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,760
here and we write code and we write good

477
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,590
code and we put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there we're going</font>

478
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to solve this cyber crime problem</font>

479
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:24,620
instead of standing around going oh my

480
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:27,020
god yeah that was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

481
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,969
we move on a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit web be dangerous</font>

482
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,710
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely it is okay back</font>

483
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,080
in the old days when the internet was

484
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,910
rainbows and ponies everybody was having

485
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,010
a really good time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then came along</font>

486
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,960
criminals and they spoiled it so what we

487
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do quite frankly is just start</font>

488
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">taking back to web so if you find</font>

489
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:47,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">something online that does a malicious</font>

490
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:49,740
infection take the time out to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

491
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:51,450
figure out who you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can contact and tell</font>

492
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,790
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

493
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">otherwise report them to spam house or</font>

494
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,300
other places<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that and make their</font>

495
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:59,730
lives difficult because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just made</font>

496
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:02,820
your lives difficult there's legal

497
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,890
ability to hack back now so spear

498
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,929
phishing attacks again I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

499
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:09,300
little bit about these because this is

500
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:11,760
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of an IT problem as it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

501
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,129
human<font color="#CCCCCC"> resources problem okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

502
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting hired right and they're being on</font>

503
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,180
boarded and they're not given any

504
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:20,130
computer usage or computer security

505
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,110
training so how does this become an IT

506
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,390
problem if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually screening</font>

507
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,889
these people against being idiots then

508
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,240
you know what we're we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

509
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,620
lose the battle<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right because</font>

510
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,480
they're going to click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on stuff faster</font>

511
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,909
than we can repair their machines for

512
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,680
God's sakes and this is another piece

513
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:37,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about is that</font>

514
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,480
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with magic here okay</font>

515
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,880
yes there are advanced persistent

516
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,690
strains of malware out there that are

517
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:48,060
truly evil and stealthy but the vast

518
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:50,550
majority of this does these four

519
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:53,220
things or one of these four things right

520
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:55,770
so again when you're talking about the

521
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,300
cybercrime infrastructure and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

522
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:00,420
horrible things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are coming out here</font>

523
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:02,250
if you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> take some steps right you</font>

524
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,370
can really lock down your environments

525
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:09,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty darn easily even against these</font>

526
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:12,570
guys donphan<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah apt whoo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

527
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:15,270
yes nation state resources are scary

528
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:17,820
really talented Russians are scary and

529
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:21,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe Israelis and maybe Americans and</font>

530
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,710
Canadians New Zealanders basically the

531
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,240
bottom line is is there some scary dudes

532
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:27,420
all over the place all right most of

533
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,550
them work in Minsk but anyways you can

534
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,710
defeat them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it comes down to this</font>

535
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:35,070
and you know I'm looking at you Jared

536
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:38,070
Bader let's not build flat networks okay

537
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:40,860
let's not plug in all of our like

538
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:43,530
DVR IP cameras and give them access to

539
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:47,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">the entire Internet let's turn off</font>

540
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:49,889
I can play<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay or it's those kind of</font>

541
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,419
easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things that aren't being done</font>

542
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,740
who here thinks putting printers

543
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,710
directly onto<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet it's a good</font>

544
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:58,320
idea anyone yeah yeah who thinks who

545
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,540
thinks having printers do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i PX</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s PX and</font>

546
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,149
like Bonjour over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is a good</font>

547
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:06,060
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> or SNMP community string set to</font>

548
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:08,160
default yeah that's that's why Mac makes

549
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:14,220
your printers print giant when you

550
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:16,320
send them print jobs<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the bottom</font>

551
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,080
line here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this network segmentation</font>

552
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,840
can do a lot to stop these guys in their

553
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,360
tracks<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay network segmentation will</font>

554
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,090
allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to control what's going on</font>

555
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so in a standard network who</font>

556
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,740
thinks here that you know work stations

557
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:34,409
should be up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email through SMTP</font>

558
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,020
protocol probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

559
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:39,780
or other crappy things that they're

560
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,670
doing right or egress filtering which is

561
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,710
not being done at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> in small and</font>

562
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:45,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">medium business in general enterprise</font>

563
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,400
companies are doing it but here's the

564
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,290
problem these companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> are getting</font>

565
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,970
infected they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even know what</font>

566
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,680
is coming out of their network right you

568
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:59,640
you find that the DNS is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Belarus that's</font>

569
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:02,370
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> good so in a lot of these situations</font>

570
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's this weird equals compromise</font>

571
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,790
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't run a global</font>

572
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,919
infrastructure I just trying to help

573
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,780
secure small/medium businesses and you

574
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,670
know what you can actually do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

575
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,800
because a lot of the times you can turn

576
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:15,540
 off in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> small/medium business and</font>

577
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,399
when you turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on you can see what</font>

578
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,139
Wireshark is telling you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

579
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,150
where it's going where it's calling up

580
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,910
seeing all your personal data floating

581
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:26,160
off to Microsoft or Google you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see</font>

582
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you can stop it now there was some</font>

583
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,120
great talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about web application</font>

584
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,950

00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:37,050
web application firewall right it's

587
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,880
these things right is your database do

588
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,419
use your<font color="#CCCCCC"> website talk to a database yes</font>

589
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,820
or no chances are probably does right

590
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:47,130
can you type anything into a page right

591
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:49,350
the best pen testers in the world start

592
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,340
with an apostrophe<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's what</font>

593
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:52,050
they're going to put into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your search</font>

594
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,730
bar and hopefully what they're going to

595
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:55,830
get is a blank page which then they go

596
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,250
to view source and guess what<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

597
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">your</font>

599
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:04,170
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-thirds of the way down right</font>

600
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:06,750
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> finally do you include a file a</font>

601
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:08,520
local file reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now I'm not</font>

602
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:11,880
saying that web application firewalls

603
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,260
are like<font color="#CCCCCC"> your the dream thing here but</font>

604
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,300
if there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these in</font>

605
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:17,250
front of a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of websites we</font>

606
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,440
would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot less of a cyber crime</font>

607
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:21,420
problem out there and they've come down

608
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,940
way down in price so that's another

609
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:26,040
thing to think about so let's get into

610
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these again little bit of</font>

611
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:32,700
sensationalizing here we're talking

612
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:34,590
really about NSA ta Oh big report came

613
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,570
out cyber crime of Death Star people

614
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:39,360
really what they were talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

615
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:42,149
what researchers had told us in 2009 at

616
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cannes a quest we can infect a BIOS who</font>

617
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:46,380
here is absolutely shocked that think

618
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,920
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like firmware and biases can</font>

619
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:51,900
be like reprogrammed for evil no one but

620
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,910
this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the largest downloaded report</font>

621

from his first<font color="#CCCCCC"> keys website for god</font>

622
00:24:53,910 --> 00:25:00,470
sakes right and all it was was<font color="#E5E5E5"> rehashing</font>

623
00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:03,180
a bunch of attacks which if you're a

624
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:05,010
intelligence service you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font>

625
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:08,250
to do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can't you probably</font>

626
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:11,010
should be fired as if I'm sad so brings

627

633
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:33,510
bunch of data and signed it off with

634
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:35,100
Allah Akbar right so of course as a

635
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:37,260
Middle East jihadist group right

636
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,510
attribution over we know who the bad

637
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,400
guys are right yet turns out was the

638
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:43,020
Russians<font color="#E5E5E5"> and James clapper had to get up</font>

639
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,420
and say yeah there seemed pretty

640
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:47,910
sophisticated fast forward to<font color="#E5E5E5"> attempt</font>

emails monkeys are so cute um well but

643
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,780
monkeys don't live in Russia so

644
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,659
absolutely the Chinese did it again

645
00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:00,050
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now it turns out Russians haha so</font>

646
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:04,020
also the same group that blew<font color="#CCCCCC"> up that</font>

647
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:07,350
that smelter Tyson crew you know again

648
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:09,179
who here thinks putting a smelter on the

649
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:10,139
internet with an IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address is a good</font>

650
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:15,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea</font>

651
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:18,390
probably not yeah so why then this is my

652
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:20,820
favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're all safe for now</font>

653
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:23,880
guys we've signed a cyber treaty with

654
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:27,530
China and we're only going to attack

655
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:31,140
each other for<font color="#CCCCCC"> non economic reasons okay</font>

656
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:33,690
now why do we have to do this completely

657
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:35,930
farcical thing we had to do it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

658
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:40,100
year before this<font color="#E5E5E5"> President Obama</font>

659
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:42,390
basically signed into law into law a a

660
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,520
executive order that said we shall

661
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:46,860
punish anyone that comes in i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a</font>

662
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,860
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> obama imitation but we shall punish</font>

663
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:52,709
anyone that attacks American businesses

664
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:54,840
and cause damage<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sweet so we</font>

665
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:57,330
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a treaty all right yeah it's</font>

666
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,980
good and then we get statistics like

667
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,600
this eighty-one percent of healthcare

668
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,280
executives say their organization has

669
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,010
been compromised by<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least one mouth</font>

670
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,450
or bought or other kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cyber attack</font>

671
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:09,530
eighty-one percent okay brought to you

672
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:13,410
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> KPMG the preferred vendor for</font>

673
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:15,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">healthcare uh-huh so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font>

674
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:17,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">right we take these numbers we</font>

675
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,320
bastardize them around and then we get

676
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:22,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">into these terrible situations where you</font>

677
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:24,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we start suing each other because</font>

678
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:27,000
people are doing a shitty job these guys

679
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,980
at california health care provider

680
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,280
cottage health systems aren't getting

681
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:34,560
their cyber breach insurance payout why

682
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:37,580
well because they paled they failed to

683
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:40,740
patch their systems in 30 days<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay an</font>

684
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:43,710
SLA of 30 days even<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't that up</font>

685
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:46,590
ok well no I could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> away on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vacation</font>

686
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:49,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">or and I do apologize because one of the</font>

687
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:52,169
reasons why b-sides is now 12 noon to

688
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:53,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">evening is because last time we had a</font>

689
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,930
b-sides and a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> drunk ended up in</font>

690
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,950
portage la prairie and had to make way

691
00:27:54,930 --> 00:28:01,320
way back um let's do this last one here

692
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:03,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay because this is really quite</font>

693
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,929
hilarious so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an attack called</font>

694
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:10,620
the carbonic attack okay and these these

695
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:12,870
guys sent a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of files okay it's a</font>

696
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,610
bunch of exploits<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Russian banks and</font>

697
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,919
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know about Russian banks well</font>

698
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,840
chances are they have great perimeter

699
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,490
security but probably not so good on the

700
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,770
inside well it turns out funny funny

701
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,399
story they used actually exploits that

702
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:27,269
were

703
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:30,059
patched so again they put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together a</font>

704
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:31,979
little package low phishing email and

705
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:34,889
also the<font color="#CCCCCC"> trojan that they then used to</font>

706
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:38,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">take over but the really funny part of</font>

707
00:28:34,889 --> 00:28:39,959
this story is that you see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> loss 300</font>

708
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:41,789
to 1 billion you're going wow that's

709
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,859
kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big number how come they don't</font>

710
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:46,019
know exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> well here's how the attack</font>

711
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:47,369
went once they taken over the machine

712
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:48,809
they threw up a screen that basically

713
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:50,820
said there was a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your user</font>

714
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:53,070
ID and password would you please call

715
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,989
our fake call center while we verify

716
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,789
your identity meanwhile in the

717
00:28:54,989 --> 00:28:58,409
background the hackers have taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

718
00:28:56,789 --> 00:29:00,690
and authenticated using two-factor

719
00:28:58,409 --> 00:29:02,279
authentication and are busy transferring

720
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:04,859
all this money to like Peruvian and

721
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:06,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">Venezuelan banks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and laundering it</font>

722
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:09,389
all over they don't know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much money</font>

723
00:29:06,749 --> 00:29:11,339
they lost and all because they didn't

724
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:13,019
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> patched and up-to-date software and</font>

725
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:14,700
they weren't running antivirus on their

726
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:16,320
end points because the actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> trojan</font>

727
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,769
that they used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take them over was</font>

728
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,559
three years old okay so this is this is

729
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:24,869
the kind of thing so I hope we've had a

730
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,839
lot of fun basically what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm asking you</font>

731
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:29,789
guys to do is use your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own kind of</font>

732
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,158
judgment and take a deeper look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

733
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:34,739
attacks move away from sensationalism

734
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,169
move away from you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the consequence</font>

735
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:39,539
of the breach and figure out how<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bad</font>

736
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:41,309
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are getting in right who they are</font>

737
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:44,429
really doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter right breaches</font>

738
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:46,678
breach and really advocate for you know

739
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:48,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">information sharing indications of</font>

740
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,609
compromise one of the worst problems

741
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,769
with our<font color="#CCCCCC"> industry so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got government</font>

742
00:29:50,609 --> 00:29:54,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">standing up in a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of cases they know</font>

743
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:56,219
what the hell's going on but they're

744
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:58,830
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> telling us they're not giving</font>

745
00:29:56,219 --> 00:30:00,509
us the hashes they're not giving us some

746
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,009
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the indications of compromises and</font>

747
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:08,039
stuff like that we could do a lot better

748
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:10,049
there so last tip of advice one is I

749
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:12,869
would have not got to where I am today

750
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:15,359
without a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of help from skull space</font>

751
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:17,218
there's two ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that you can be</font>

752
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:20,309
successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> or information security right</font>

753
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:22,859
one is by a lot of beer for people and

754
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:25,918
tweet often that was my course the other

755
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:27,539
is get super smart like Ron or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian or</font>

756
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,999
any of the other guys that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you seen up</font>

757
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:31,619
on this stage the bottom line is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we</font>

758
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:33,539
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together and that's why</font>

759
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:35,999
this community<font color="#CCCCCC"> is so vitally important</font>

760
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:36,990
