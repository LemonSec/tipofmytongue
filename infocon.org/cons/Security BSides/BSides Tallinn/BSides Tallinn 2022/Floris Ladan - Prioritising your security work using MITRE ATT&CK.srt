1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,500
hey

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,299
wow

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,639
thanks

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,400
thanks for thanks for having me telling

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,400
um so let's let's kick it off

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,240
um so first first thing is who am I uh

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,760
my name is Flores Ladon I'm a strategist

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,199
at Splunk

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,640
and I've been working in security for

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,080
over 15 years

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,359
started as a pen tester for consulting

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,580
firm and I was like okay I can do that

13
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,159
so I can do defense right

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,200
um well that became difficult

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,420
so I joined the large bank and became

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,100
their first uh one of their first

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,440
Defenders setting up IDs and that kind

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,399
of stuff

19
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,700
and build a fair shock and and started

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,219
really really getting into defense and

21
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,260
defense is hard in some ways harder

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,539
because you need to be structured

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,660
so uh yeah my biggest success is I

24
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,760
switched to another company now and I no

25
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,379
longer have to wear a suit so I'm really

26
00:00:58,379 --> 00:00:59,940
happy on that part

27
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,879
the real question is why listen to me

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,119
and I'm I'm good at failing I failed a

29
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:06,780
lot

30
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,060
um I failed building a shock three times

31
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,280
and if if miter attack and and

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,960
prioritizing your work is something you

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,700
already know at least be entertained in

34
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,840
my failures

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,939
and and beyond that we'll see what what

36
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,080
happened

37
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,140
so the first time I built the shock I

38
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,000
forgot the people we forgot that we

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,259
didn't have proper stuffing we didn't

40
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,119
have rosters we didn't have shifts we

41
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,500
didn't have motivated people because

42
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
they came from all other network

43
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,180
monitoring stuff they came from the cash

44
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,340
counting Security Site they get from

45
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,960
physical security

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,119
and then the second time we said okay

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,979
we'll hire people we'll do it again and

48
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,960
we failed again because we forgot about

49
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,240
the processes we didn't have a mandate

50
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,400
people came to us why are you why are

51
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,500
you unplugging my PC well it's for the

52
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,579
viruses

53
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,439
yeah sure but I can still keep working

54
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,380
go away okay lesson learned we needed a

55
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,659
mandate a mission a vision we need to

56
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,280
keep having budget

57
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,680
and and we needed time to figure out

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,659
what we had to do because one of the

59
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,040
things we did we tried to implement

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,380
everything we try to implement all the

61
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,239
use cases we could find

62
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,459
and that had its own problems but the

63
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,780
third time actually we figured out what

64
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,760
we had to do we figured out how to train

65
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,980
the people and we figured out the

66
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,840
process we needed to keep running and

67
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,120
that time we actually succeeded

68
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,520
and the question is how do you know what

69
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,680
you need to do because we started using

70
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,420
security Frameworks because there was so

71
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,440
much work coming at us

72
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,459
what what do we need to manage how do

73
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:33,660
you use those Frameworks we started

74
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,400
reading all of them and that wasn't a

75
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,980
success we implemented some controls but

76
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,660
we couldn't do everything

77
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,300
and we started mapping actors threads

78
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,220
skill change making our own Freedom

79
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,500
works and that got us further but the

80
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,019
real question always was how do we know

81
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,360
what controls we actually need and

82
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,459
that's what this slide is getting into

83
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,200
so but before we go into uh into uh how

84
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,580
to do this let's go into the history of

85
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,260
security Frameworks first because we

86
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,480
have two type of framework we've got the

87
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,640
management Frameworks and

88
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,140
these are this is for information

89
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,900
security managers it's lots of policy

90
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,840
for Access Control it's lots of of iso

91
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,239
27 or 2001

92
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,480
um 47001 and it's it's you've got the

93
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,040
song says 20 you've got all these

94
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,780
controls and there are a lot of work to

95
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,819
implement but they don't tell you

96
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,920
anything about monitoring they don't

97
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,080
tell you anything about how to deal what

98
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,540
use cases should be where Etc

99
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,700
so we move Beyond there

100
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,739
security detection Frameworks are a

101
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,440
subset of that it doesn't tell you how

102
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,060
to protect everything but it will tell

103
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,860
you how to start building your

104
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,959
detections and the first thing we

105
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,680
started out with uh was uh actually some

106
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,940
of them you might know but the first one

107
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,700
we started out with uh was the UDA Loop

108
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,379
so the UDA Loop is written by John Boyd

109
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,080
and John Boyd was a fighter pilot in the

110
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,239
Korean War and he wrote a book called A

111
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,000
discourse of winning and losing and it

112
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,940
was aimed at a couple of strategies

113
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,920
mainly at observe what are you seeing

114
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,980
Orient or am I in John's case in

115
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,720
relation to the plane in a cyber defense

116
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,519
in relation to the attack what's

117
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,079
happening where we should be aware of

118
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,399
all those surroundings

119
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,320
based on that make a decision on how

120
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,139
you're going to go forward decide and

121
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,080
then do it Act it's great it's really

122
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,580
reopened this was one of the first

123
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,320
Frameworks we encountered in cyber

124
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,720
security it told us how to act rational

125
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,060
it didn't tell us what to do

126
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,340
so we had something else Lockheed Martin

127
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,580
of course came along with the Cyber kill

128
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,720
chain

129
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,139
and for those of you who didn't know the

130
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,120
Cyber kill chain was built as a response

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,780
to the RSA attack and in that case look

132
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,100
at Martin was attacked by means of

133
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,860
compromise to the RSA token uh they got

134
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,180
hacked and the attackers got away with

135
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,000
their IP and IP is critical for these

136
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,139
companies because these are their

137
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,660
inventions this is National Security

138
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,820
this is going to be the next future of

139
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,979
tech that the future Wars will be fought

140
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,139
with so that was critical critical and

141
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,820
the good thing they did they started

142
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,860
making this high level framework and

143
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,680
said were they focused on recon

144
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,100
weaponization delivery exploitation

145
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,380
Etc so these high-level categories that

146
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,180
we could at least start grouping our use

147
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,280
cases in because at that time I had

148
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,840
multiple Rules running multiple systems

149
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,940
running and I didn't make a distinction

150
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,800
if it was an antivirus rule or a knit

151
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,740
rule or any other detection

152
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,620
so making that distinction and making

153
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,860
this framework in a strategic way helped

154
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,780
us to at least start splitting out those

155
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,280
use cases

156
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,440
these are there's one problem

157
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,120
uh the first thing of course

158
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,759
weaponization it's a nice step any

159
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,940
attacker does it uh but there's it's I

160
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,979
haven't seen anyone write a defense

161
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,380
against that you can't write a detection

162
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,300
against something an attacker prefers on

163
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,500
his own PC

164
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,139
so it starts it starts to crumble a bit

165
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,720
there the other pattern we're seeing

166
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,820
here is that these were all based on

167
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,220
intelligence and I was working or sorry

168
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,699
in all military applications So based on

169
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,740
the confidentiality of the information

170
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,500
keeping it secret I was working in

171
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,620
finance my goal was mainly keeping it in

172
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,620
integer keeping it uh

173
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,720
as it is make sure nothing gets changed

174
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,240
because if somebody changes information

175
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,100
for a bank that could be have a bigger

176
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,680
consequences than leaking information

177
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,600
luckily we had some influx in in 2013

178
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,460
Katie Nichols one of the first speakers

179
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,120
came forth with the miter framework and

180
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,280
the miter attack framework took part of

181
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,139
the look at Martin kill chain

182
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,919
and post compromise started building out

183
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:59,340
the tactics that are beneath that

184
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,160
so that helped us focusing to the next

185
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,199
set of granularity which is great and

186
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,180
everybody's working now with the micro

187
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,340
Tech framework

188
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,780
um for the ones of you who don't know

189
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,940
I'll go over briefly but the micro

190
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,100
attack framework 12th technique 12

191
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,979
tactics over 500 techniques this is an

192
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,360
old slide of mine I think a couple of

193
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,759
years ago I wrote 257 we're now at

194
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:25,919
573 from the top of my head it's

195
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,740
expanded to techniques sub techniques

196
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,500
so that's great and the first thing you

197
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,180
do is you have if you get a framework

198
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,380
like this which tells you what

199
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,780
everything you can do is you implement

200
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,000
all the use cases right

201
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,160
no no

202
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,680
because what you do if you build this

203
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,319
really really great complex machine you

204
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,940
enable all the use cases out of the box

205
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,280
for any security tool you have you get

206
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,280
overwhelmed you get thousands of alerts

207
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,620
and if you get thousands of alerts you

208
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,419
get thousands of incidents to handle you

209
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:58,860
get thousands of things to investigate

210
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,319
and you can't do that remember an

211
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,360
average stock analyst can investigate 8

212
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,759
to 16 alerts a day

213
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,440
so you need to have an incredible team

214
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,120
to manage that

215
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,280
the other thing is that you're managing

216
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,440
people and these people get overwhelmed

217
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,180
we're trying to hire

218
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,740
the people who are in this room here

219
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,000
we're trying to hire the digital

220
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,139
detectives

221
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,120
we're trying to hire the Cyber

222
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,979
professionals people who are interested

223
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,319
in puzzling solving a puzzle or a

224
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,599
repetitive puzzle a non-repetitive

225
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,819
puzzle and if you give people who like

226
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,159
puzzling repetitive work alert after

227
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,159
alert day after day day after day they

228
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,219
will leave it's a terrible job so we

229
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,958
didn't only need to get rid of the

230
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,120
alerts we need to make sure we have the

231
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,339
right alerts which were worth following

232
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,080
up

233
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,300
so yeah and that's that's

234
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,459
the thing that we do we need to look at

235
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,800
as well so of the use cases and

236
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,940
techniques

237
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,180
uh implementing all of them is an

238
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,640
all-you-can-eat buffet you can't eat

239
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,160
everything on that menu it doesn't make

240
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,240
sense

241
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,160
it doesn't give you it doesn't give you

242
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,839
a good time and by the way you might not

243
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,459
even like fish

244
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,620
so it's the same with use cases if you

245
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,019
are protecting an organization and you

246
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,080
know you're not running

247
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,760
Windows then stop focusing on the

248
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,920
Windows detections now this is a simple

249
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,080
example but it continues and it works

250
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,000
out for every subset in that attack

251
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,180
figure out what you need to do because

252
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,339
bigger is not always better the real

253
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,700
goal is tailoring these use cases get

254
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,440
the suit that fits not the biggest suit

255
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,940
so now we come to a choice

256
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,040
the Paradox of choices which detection

257
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,040
should you choose the most popular ones

258
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,500
I mean everybody's going off the log for

259
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,360
GA exploits that was hot still hot

260
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,820
everybody has it in their demos sure go

261
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,899
for that one

262
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,880
maybe you should use the ones for the

263
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,220
data sources you already have you might

264
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,080
already have network data let's start

265
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,279
with those because that's at least

266
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,600
something we can do

267
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,000
or the ones your CC will appreciate I

268
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,560
mean everybody like us is trying to make

269
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,660
a career right being the be in the

270
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,820
Limelight

271
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,660
um or we'll do something else

272
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,720
we'll use a structured approach based on

273
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,720
research and common knowledge

274
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,260
so and that's that's that's a better way

275
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,480
of to communicate of what you're doing

276
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,180
because if you start focusing on the

277
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,260
highlights you're going to keep running

278
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,180
so you need to get some kind of

279
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,500
structure in

280
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,300
now there's a couple of ways to

281
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,760
prioritize that you can focus on the

282
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,800
brand new threats everything coming out

283
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,320
you can focus on that

284
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,540
um secondly you can focus by technique

285
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,540
so for example there's a technique which

286
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,000
two 200 fret groups are using well

287
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,380
that's the one I should be focusing on

288
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,600
first that also has a merit at least

289
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,279
better than focus on the new shiny

290
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,079
threat which just came up yesterday

291
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,940
um and later is a look at industry

292
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,680
mapping and that's the real part where

293
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,600
you start tailoring what you're doing to

294
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,279
who you are and who you need to be

295
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,100
protecting if you work in finance you

296
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,959
should be afraid of the group's

297
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,660
targeting Finance

298
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,620
um and then the fourth one is take a

299
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,720
look at the techniques seen in the wild

300
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,779
if you can split down to that level

301
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:23,100
focus on which techniques have been

302
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,500
observed and there's a great project

303
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,440
which we'll go into which is a Mitra uh

304
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,240
Ingenuity adversary sightings project

305
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,519
and we'll dive into that a bit

306
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,060
lastly top attacks which which is a new

307
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,880
methodology from for Mitra and anything

308
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,620
you can find for third parties that's

309
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,360
also a solution I would not really

310
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,800
recommend that

311
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,440
to just get a top top hits and start

312
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,140
start writing detections for that

313
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,720
so for the first methodology the brand

314
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,880
new critical threats and and the problem

315
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,980
is some threats just come out of nowhere

316
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,680
so you need to focus on those if log for

317
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,300
Shell comes out if half new comes out

318
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,459
there was no warning there was not a lot

319
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:03,720
you could do about it except start

320
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,760
running so at some point you're always

321
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,640
at the mercy of force of going into

322
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,100
defense for whatever comes up

323
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,440
and you can follow your threat fenders

324
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,060
from the from those

325
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,860
um I work for a company who has a threat

326
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,899
fee who has a threat feed a threat post

327
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,940
you can Implement automatically or

328
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,279
manually to get those detections running

329
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,040
now if the firefighting part is done and

330
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,200
you get back to your normal work you can

331
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,360
start thinking about popularity

332
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,300
which threats are the most popular so

333
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,339
what should I be implementing focusing

334
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,959
on malicious file we've seen that the

335
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,959
most maybe focusing on spear fishing

336
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,240
um so this helps this is a broad net

337
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,339
you're casting there and what you get

338
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,680
from that is is a good result but it's

339
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,320
not tailored to what you can be doing

340
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,700
best

341
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,279
the second thing is that the miter

342
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,680
attack framework focuses on threat

343
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,079
reports and it really provides a data

344
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,600
set which is enriched with which apt

345
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,480
groups go for what technology and where

346
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,339
they've been observed if you work with

347
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,260
the Mitra attack Explorer you can load

348
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,360
layers in there you can view overlays

349
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,700
for these threads so now you're starting

350
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,100
diving into attackers in a general in a

351
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,320
general way which attacker does what

352
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,480
but it doesn't say how often this attack

353
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,399
occurs so we're still doing a general

354
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,040
filtering

355
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,079
the second thing which which I think

356
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,300
starts to focus on who am I and what am

357
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,459
I trying to protect take a look at

358
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,920
industry mapping if you work in finance

359
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,139
there are some Korean and North Korean

360
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,459
actors who need to be watching out for

361
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,680
they're not exactly for anymore if you

362
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,540
work in the defense industry if you work

363
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,760
in high tech other types of active

364
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,820
Supply so figure out which groups are

365
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
targeting your companies or the company

366
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,320
in the sector you're working for

367
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,579
actually

368
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,700
and then it starts to get you more

369
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,279
guidance on what to pick

370
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,560
um the newest thing which which which I

371
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,060
really enjoyed was a project running

372
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,060
since 2019. the miter Ingenuity

373
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,339
adversary sightings project

374
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:09,000
it was a a list made with data from

375
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,459
amongst others red Cannery for those of

376
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,200
you who don't know red Cannery runs on a

377
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,560
sort of Open Source sandbox

378
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,779
detectional attacks and they were able

379
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:21,000
to collect over 6 million sightings of

380
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,820
adversary Behavior

381
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:28,260
it ran from April 2019 to July 2021 and

382
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,139
in that time they got 1.1 million

383
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,820
observed act techniques in the wild

384
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,540
that's great we finally know what on

385
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,339
average is coming in and is being

386
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,040
exploited so we're getting a real feel

387
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,320
of what attackers are doing in our

388
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,980
environments

389
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,540
um and we can go through the list and

390
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,980
there's not going to be much surprises

391
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,800
because this is again a general top list

392
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,139
being used so if you have ever done

393
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,360
attack response you'll find these top

394
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,459
listings there

395
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,500
uh there's also stuff like living off

396
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,180
the land on there there's legitimate

397
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,639
files there's a bind assign binary

398
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,180
execution it's the usual stuff

399
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,019
um but what it does it allows you and it

400
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,240
allowed my trip to get you a calculator

401
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,399
and I invite everybody to play with that

402
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,120
miter attack techniques calculator it

403
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,120
allows you to fill out uh what defenses

404
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,800
you have how well you're monitoring your

405
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,420
network how well are you monitoring your

406
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,160
endpoints how well are you monitoring

407
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,680
your gateways your cloud services Etc

408
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,800
and based on your own rating you get a

409
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,480
list of customized attacks back so

410
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,060
that's great now we have something that

411
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,980
we can start working on based on the

412
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,180
data from there

413
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,180
how do they calculate this uh what they

414
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,459
do is they take a look at prevalence how

415
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,620
much an attacker uses a specific miter

416
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,880
attack over time

417
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,100
they take a look at choke points and

418
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,420
we'll get into choke points in a bit but

419
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,940
it's a point where attacks converge

420
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,399
uh we'll take a look at actionability

421
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,920
there might be a very often used attack

422
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,800
but it can't be detected upon so they

423
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,199
also rate that part and that will give

424
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,360
you a list of top techniques

425
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,060
the cool thing is that with this list of

426
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,399
top techniques we can start focusing on

427
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,620
what's important to us but first take a

428
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,420
look at the data there

429
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,600
so if we take a look at the prevalence

430
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,519
we can see that attacks have been

431
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,180
occurring uh over the almost two years

432
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,980
that this project was running

433
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,260
but what the prevalence also means is

434
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,060
that if an attack has been popular in

435
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,920
the last couple of months we're giving

436
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,079
it a higher rating it's been given a

437
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,940
higher rating than if it's been running

438
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,100
two years ago because if it was really

439
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,019
active two years ago it doesn't mean it

440
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,600
still applies to us now

441
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,940
and then the second thing is if you have

442
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,620
your prevalence you know what's re

443
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,500
what's been recently important you can

444
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,180
also move on to the best place to start

445
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,259
detecting

446
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,899
take a look at choke points if you

447
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,639
remember the Microtech Matrix you had

448
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,000
the the tactics in a vertical column the

449
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,099
technique horizontal if you can imagine

450
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,720
your attacker going through that they

451
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,359
will make a chain of attacks now there

452
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,939
are certain points in this in this

453
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:14,220
Matrix where they will have no option

454
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,520
they will go to fire one maybe two

455
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,380
techniques in order to move further in

456
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,240
their total attack these are what's

457
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,520
called choke points so for example in

458
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,119
this case process injection is somewhere

459
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,100
is a choke point they will always use so

460
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,940
if I monitor process injection I don't

461
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,799
have to monitor create process with

462
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,780
token or resource hijacking that much

463
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,640
because process injection is the place

464
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,440
it will always the attacker will always

465
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,480
pass through I'm not saying don't do

466
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,640
anything I'm saying this is a very

467
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,660
effective

468
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,059
a technique to focus on because it's

469
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,940
identified as a choke point here

470
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,340
the second thing is actionability it's

471
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,860
the opportunity for a Defender to detect

472
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,100
or mitigate a technique based on the

473
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,960
available

474
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,539
analytics or controls so in simpler ways

475
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:07,260
it can be separated into two in two

476
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,640
categories detections or mitigations

477
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,679
and based on publicly available

478
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,020
resources on the amount of controls and

479
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,380
detections we can calculate what's

480
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,320
weighted more heavily or less heavily

481
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,020
and there's a number of of uh of ways of

482
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,640
doing that there's the miter cyber

483
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,039
analytic response repository there's

484
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,679
rule from elastic from Sigma Splunk has

485
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,200
has their detections as well and with

486
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,660
the ordinance controls and with those

487
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,700
there's also a calculator you can start

488
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,280
using from the Ingenuity project

489
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,039
to start calculating these uh the the

490
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:49,679
uh the actionability of those

491
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,720
now the first thing of course the

492
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,940
methodology for priority prioritization

493
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,280
and this is where Red Canary has given

494
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,679
us a great view of what what's happening

495
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,580
most often and if you start putting

496
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,840
these all together

497
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,480
it means that we're going to start with

498
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,000
the miter framework we're going to add a

499
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,960
point

500
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,640
for

501
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,160
every fret actor that uses a particular

502
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,419
technique

503
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:18,840
and then we subtract a point for every

504
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,059
detection that's mapped to that

505
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,559
technique and what comes out of that is

506
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,740
a way to detection map

507
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,860
so we've taken into account existing

508
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,900
coverage where have we got rules now in

509
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,520
this case we've taken I've taken my own

510
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,700
companies detections because I can't be

511
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,559
running around with customer or any

512
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,179
other company detection so this is what

513
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,440
we develop

514
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,500
and based on the rules we started to

515
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,520
focus on the areas where risk is high

516
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,740
and then

517
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,679
on the opposite part of that using the

518
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,340
Fret group data we add points for every

519
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,740
threat group

520
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,900
that use a particular technique and we

521
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,660
subtract another point for what we have

522
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,660
a detection mapped to that and what we

523
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,020
get out of that is a map on what we need

524
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,080
to prioritize and as you can see there's

525
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,260
really a map there of what turns dark

526
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,360
red is where we haven't got detections

527
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,820
but we're seeing it in the wild recently

528
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,220
so we should be starting to focus our

529
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,140
effort there

530
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,840
really start building this one first

531
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,419
this is what's critical for us

532
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:33,299
there's one thing to consider

533
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,140
um

534
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,620
don't focus on it too much

535
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,200
because attack coverage

536
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,720
does not mean completeness

537
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,419
so if a user develops a mechanism to see

538
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:48,419
if a process has been injected uh and

539
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,160
you know that you've got a detection on

540
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,720
your EDR solution

541
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,460
you might not have covered your server

542
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,320
landscape because servers are not

543
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,600
usually running EDR it comes back on

544
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,120
performance it causes weird issues so if

545
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,559
you're running EDR don't think you're

546
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,539
fully protected you're protected on only

547
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,640
your desktop landscapes

548
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,240
so it focus it focuses on compliance but

549
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,320
you need to keep thinking about

550
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,720
completeness is every detection running

551
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,780
on my entire organization

552
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,460
so there will be also refers or

553
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,360
containers or endpoint clouds Etc

554
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,500
and um

555
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,559
for a conclusion your time is is limited

556
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,260
so you need to figure out uh what brings

557
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,059
you value don't don't be don't be the

558
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:31,740
kid in the candy shop just because you

559
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,840
get a tool just just because because you

560
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,600
get a shiny EDR a shiny IDs a shiny xdr

561
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,840
whatever comes out don't take the use

562
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,820
cases for granted think if they're

563
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,159
applicable it seems easy to turn them on

564
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,260
but every tool every rule every

565
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,039
detection you run needs to be maintained

566
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:50,940
um

567
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,159
use a structured approach you need to

568
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:54,960
run sometimes everybody needs to run for

569
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,900
the next for the next uh for the next

570
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,299
new threat coming out but at some point

571
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:02,940
you need to sit back think about top

572
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,400
down what's the work done and and don't

573
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,440
start from scratch so don't start from

574
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,179
scratch use miter you see a tech

575
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:13,679
framework for uh for as much as you can

576
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,500
coverage is not completeness if you only

577
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,299
have a tool running on part of the

578
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:19,200
organization

579
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,860
focus on uh don't forget that other

580
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,240
parts of your organization might still

581
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,880
be applicable a tool like the magma

582
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,320
security framework helps with that

583
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,140
because it asks you to assess your

584
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,419
coverage

585
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,460
um and don't focus on detection and

586
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,340
monitoring because security starts at

587
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,200
good security design you need prevention

588
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,820
you need mitigation you need user

589
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,120
training and uh and that's all crucial

590
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,919
everything a proper sock

591
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,100
and with that I see I've gone way way

592
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,820
way too fast but

593
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,580
thanks for listening to this extreme

594
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:00,000
lightning talk uh there's a link here

595
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,600
and the fqr code that it leads to our

596
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,220
company's GitHub page where we describe

597
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,659
how to do these detections how to

598
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:09,120
calculate this and also run

599
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,720
adversary calculations against the Mitra

600
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,220
framework so

601
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,000
thanks for that

602
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,799
[Applause]

603
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,340
you need really fast fast talk and there

604
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,000
was a lot of links basically I think

605
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
kind of like each of the slides if I

606
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,460
would click the link would take me I

607
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,679
don't know Howard read or something like

608
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,679
that of how to read probably and then a

609
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,840
couple of hours to try to implement the

610
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,960
other slides also somewhere on the

611
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,900
behind the QR code or do you share them

612
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,179
I think I share them with you guys I

613
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,940
said is that option okay yeah because I

614
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,100
know people have been asking an audience

615
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,120
that all the slides shared it depends on

616
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,159
a particular presenter if the slides are

617
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,880
kind of things they want to share but I

618
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,520
hope this one is uh yeah because it's

619
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,740
like I was kind of like I couldn't can't

620
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,860
take enough snapshots to find the URLs

621
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,080
later so I was hoping we could share it

622
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,360
somewhere on the B-side space yeah I

623
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,299
think it's very good because so it's

624
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:22,620
something I definitely put into my

625
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,960
reading list

626
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,440
so do we have on the end of the first

627
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,480
presentation some questions also

628
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,880
do we have a microphone lady yes

629
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,159
microphone lady is ready but I don't see

630
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,299
any hands there is and yeah and as

631
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:42,360
always the best question will get the

632
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,539
possibility to get some merch from back

633
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:48,900
there so please uh before your question

634
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,600
if there is a next one wanting to ask

635
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,240
question raise your hands so I or

636
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,340
somebody can bring your mic your next

637
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,380
mic is coming there so yeah so sorry

638
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,720
please you started there talk about

639
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,179
failure free time making sock uh what

640
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:05,159
was the time frame I mean the Cycles

641
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,380
yeah the time the time frame was nine

642
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,080
and a half years almost 10 about three

643
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,659
years per person and and the first thing

644
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:15,600
we did was a IDs solution and that that

645
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,100
needed some assistance and then we

646
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,140
started another

647
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,360
antivirus tooling data loss prevention

648
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,340
tooling and then you get overwhelmed

649
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,200
because your day starts with five tools

650
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,179
and the new technique came along called

651
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,520
the scene and and that started helping

652
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,120
so uh and and it is really a slow

653
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,520
process and and nowadays there's better

654
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,260
books to read there's a crafting the

655
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,080
infrastructure book uh book which I

656
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,600
which I really recommend there's a bunch

657
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,120
of stuff to read when setting up a sock

658
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,400
uh and I'm happy for that because it

659
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,980
means that people get uh used to the

660
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,240
Frameworks and there's of course stuff

661
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,100
like Mitra which is really really nice

662
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,260
uh which I'm finally starting to like

663
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,179
because it's no longer a review that you

664
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,700
have to do everything which nobody can

665
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,279
do it used to be an eternal Eternal

666
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,840
project every day getting more micro

667
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,760
detections in

668
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,820
um and so yeah in in about

669
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,440
uh three years we built the first

670
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,200
environment and that crashed because for

671
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,220
some reason we got a small business

672
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,860
environment and you can't run a global

673
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,059
bank with that

674
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,880
uh the second thing we did was hire more

675
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,159
people which is great but then suddenly

676
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:26,100
yeah I was 25 I had a team to manage

677
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,779
which is also getting you into new

678
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,299
problems there's a saying I wish you

679
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:32,700
lots of lots of stuff and it's not it's

680
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,220
it's not a compliment it's an insult and

681
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,020
that turned out to be true because you

682
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,559
needed to do a lot more uh so by the

683
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,240
time we had that ready we were also

684
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,700
almost three years later and we started

685
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,559
again and the third shop we implemented

686
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,559
was uh was the one with kept running we

687
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:52,380
had we had rosters we had games we had

688
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,960
uh Team outings because you need to keep

689
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,000
yourself and people happy and

690
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,039
interesting stuff like hackathon stuff

691
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,200
like the social experience around that

692
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,000
was it was critical to keep the stock

693
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,679
running and that's something I learned

694
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:08,520
in the the three years before that

695
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,620
um and then when I left I started with

696
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,840
three people I was the fourth when I

697
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,360
left I think we were 65 so that that

698
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,100
shows a bit of the growth that of course

699
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,440
every stock went through but I had the

700
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,419
luxury of of growing with that

701
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,919
and thanks I think next mic is already

702
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,460
there yes yes thank you for the great

703
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:34,559
talk my question is um is more towards

704
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,779
the Splunk strategy because you have

705
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,600
highlighted the importance of people and

706
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,740
processes in socks so the question is

707
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,779
um how to empower uh these core things

708
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:54,179
for sock with Splunk tools yeah

709
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:57,419
um so great question I'm I I wasn't in

710
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:59,940
in hours I originally had a demo planned

711
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,360
uh but I'm not in a situation where I

712
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,220
can do a demo here live but there is a

713
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,740
an app used for guidance and learning

714
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,020
called Security Essentials it contains

715
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,140
the micro attack Explorer and it allows

716
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,360
you not only to fuel the rules you have

717
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,640
enabled that you're running it also

718
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,179
allows you to view these attacks by

719
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:24,419
attack group so in that tool we when we

720
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,460
have an update we update the attack

721
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,799
groups we update the prevalence as much

722
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,600
as we can to reflect because it needs to

723
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,120
be a small piece of software and then we

724
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,380
push that out

725
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,320
to the app now the app will guide you so

726
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,299
you can select the sector you're working

727
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:42,120
in you can select the thread groups

728
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,400
you're looking at and you can select the

729
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,320
priority weight from the red Cannery

730
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,740
research

731
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,580
thanks any more questions

732
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,320
because uh and uh yeah did you see

733
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,279
somebody

734
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,620
okay yeah I told you this was going to

735
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,299
be a talk about me failing and this is

736
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:05,640
me failing to have a 45 minute talk in

737
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,460
45 minutes so you probably try to out to

738
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,320
me in speed talking yeah

739
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,080
is Splunk now protected from spare

740
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,720
fishing attachments that was one of the

741
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,140
techniques you had in red uh a Splunk

742
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,399
protected

743
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:25,860
yeah I think you had a slide about your

744
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,700
yeah oh no so what we see is that we are

745
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,399
we have been focusing our last attacks

746
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,940
from when we made that uh that uh

747
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,460
analysis that we started focusing a lot

748
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,980
of attacks on spearfishing analysis as

749
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,659
well so the new detection we've written

750
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:44,640
out are grouped in what we call an

751
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,860
analytic story and that story was around

752
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,140
spear fishing and fishing so that's how

753
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,899
we we our research Team figures out what

754
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:54,299
to do and that's also how we started the

755
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:56,220
idea of matching this and weighing this

756
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,399
around

757
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:00,960
I think there was a question there

758
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,380
somewhere

759
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,059
so I have a following question that once

760
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:13,260
you have set up your like major attack

761
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,659
monitoring tool so to speak your

762
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:18,779
detections and we all know that talk is

763
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:21,659
a continuous process so you have to keep

764
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:24,419
track of the detections you already have

765
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:26,460
detections you need to implement and

766
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,440
detection that may not longer be as

767
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,860
relevant yeah how do you keep track of

768
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,260
those and how do you continuously do

769
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,240
that okay that's a good that's a cool

770
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,299
question so there's two things you need

771
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:40,980
to monitor when working in a sock

772
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,799
firstly and primarily is instant life

773
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:46,320
cycle if it if an alert goes off someone

774
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,640
needs to pick it up it needs to be

775
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,559
investigated and closed and not be lying

776
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,419
around that's what we call the instant

777
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:54,419
life cycle the second one is a use case

778
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,059
or detection life cycle that needs to be

779
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,039
a continuous proven and it starts with

780
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,539
hunting it starts with research it

781
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:02,460
starts with news whatever you can get

782
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,740
your input on on the new Skype type of

783
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,080
threads so you need to take that

784
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,000
information let's say there's a new new

785
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,240
TTP there's a new ioc Etc you start

786
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,580
developing or searching in your in your

787
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,440
environment where can I find evidence

788
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,200
for this where can I find this data am I

789
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,760
finding it in the right places can I

790
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,500
refine this search can I exclude the

791
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,539
stuff which is false positive and you

792
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:26,880
might for this manual work get a result

793
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,620
that's great you've now found this

794
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,679
needle in the haystack based on that you

795
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,940
don't want to be doing the same work

796
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,860
every day because of course smart people

797
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,260
in the stock no repetitive work so

798
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,399
you're going to take that search you're

799
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,260
going to put it into a detection into an

800
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,000
alert you're going to make it sure it

801
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,919
runs regularly it's going to keep

802
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,720
running and it's not going to be perfect

803
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,520
the world changes you might have made it

804
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,840
a mistake which you haven't seen over

805
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,000
the last time you were searching it

806
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,100
starts triggering too positive but also

807
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,899
false positives so you need to start

808
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:56,820
tuning you get back to tuning you get to

809
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,980
back to refining you might even get back

810
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,360
to hunting because you need to improve

811
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,220
something again and at that point you

812
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,080
need to decide am I keeping this use

813
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,840
case or am I throwing this away so

814
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,640
that's the use case of a life cycle A

815
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,700
Life That's a life cycle of a use case

816
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,740
and with that life cycle you need to

817
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,419
determine at what point that use case

818
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:18,120
needs to be phased out so that's the

819
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,159
second process running and together the

820
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,720
first process make sure everything gets

821
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,580
handled the second process make sure

822
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,559
that everything you're optimizing keeps

823
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,360
being optimized because you're right it

824
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,880
never stops it never stops tuning it

825
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,100
never stops refining it never stops

826
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,159
improving and it'll suck

827
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:37,260
so as I understood correctly one process

828
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,140
for managing and

829
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,860
individual

830
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,659
detection life cycle and separate

831
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,520
process for managing the all the

832
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,640
detection life cycles continuously

833
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,100
um now there's there's an entire well

834
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,260
there's multiple ways to skin a cat I'm

835
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,179
not going to tell you how to run your

836
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:56,460
shock but I can tell you how I did it we

837
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,679
had uh one process running to make sure

838
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,960
instance gets handled in a good way

839
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,000
we had another process running which

840
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,779
makes sure that every

841
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:09,059
two and a half weeks we had a review of

842
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:11,700
a set of use cases because every use

843
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,980
cases we analyzed if they were handled

844
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,240
correctly or not we took that

845
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,279
information we took that together with

846
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,720
the true false positive rates and we

847
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,100
figured out what we need what we needed

848
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,360
to start tuning

849
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,399
so that was the second process where we

850
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:25,320
used to take a chunk of use cases each

851
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,539
time and refine those and there we

852
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,279
figure out if we still wanted them if we

853
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,919
need to improve them or discard them

854
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,299
thank you sir

855
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:35,100
you're welcome

856
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,620
any next tense or do I get also a

857
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,899
question like if I wanted actually to

858
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:43,799
ask one question uh myself also namely

859
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:46,559
you have been in different sizes of

860
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,240
socks starting from whatever three

861
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,019
persons or 265 and and so on and

862
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:54,840
probably the kind of like let's say the

863
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,179
conceptual level you are working on this

864
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:59,580
is different like if you have one I.T

865
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,799
guy you are probably just watching that

866
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,080
people's passwords are kind of like uh

867
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,120
somewhat strong and if you have 65

868
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,119
people you probably can do a lot of

869
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,359
things but do you see some kind of a

870
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:16,520
size of sock or security team

871
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,679
we're actually going deeper into the

872
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,800
Mitra attack Matrix is actually relevant

873
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,739
where you have P how much people do you

874
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,560
need to make this actually

875
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,899
graspable it's it's interesting it was a

876
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:32,820
I did a presentation recently with a

877
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,580
slide focusing on the sizes of shock

878
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,000
teams compared to their organizations

879
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,440
it appears that there's a large number

880
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,780
of smaller organizations who just have

881
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,300
one or two people running and then

882
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,159
you're usually in firefighting mode you

883
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,139
can't run a sock you can maybe prevent

884
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,300
the worst and accept the risk that

885
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,339
something bad happens on the rest

886
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:55,560
larger organizations get a chance to

887
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,339
grow onto Free People for People maybe

888
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:00,920
even five

889
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,780
and with that amount of monitoring you

890
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,760
can do daily work day monitoring you

891
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,920
can't do 24 7.

892
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,540
um at that level is the first level

893
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,760
where you can start to take a break take

894
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,040
a breather take a step back and start

895
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,359
focusing on what you need to be doing

896
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,280
because that's the first level where you

897
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,740
can step out of firefighting mode and

898
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,380
you can start a structured approach

899
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,880
um it used to be that this was the

900
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,380
minimum level for a shock what we're

901
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,000
seeing now more and more that people are

902
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,920
automating their work away and I'm

903
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,680
really happy with that because my Mantra

904
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,540
is don't have smart people do repetitive

905
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,140
work so automate away the boring stuff

906
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,700
and we're seeing that if more gets

907
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,280
automated people get in the luxury of

908
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,200
working on their own strategy of working

909
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,440
on their own uh on their own priorities

910
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,260
and that's where this comes into play

911
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,240
now looking at the the rest of the the

912
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,400
socks if you're looking to the larger

913
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,200
corporations multiple thousands of users

914
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,300
then you get stocks spending into 20

915
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,940
people or sometimes even more now those

916
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,760
stocks certainly have their own entire

917
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,440
security organization surrounding that

918
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,240
that might have separate use case teams

919
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,160
next to the operations teams which is

920
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,700
interesting because you get competitive

921
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,800
one team wants to create alerts and the

922
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,119
other team wants as little alerts as

923
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,920
possible so if now just create a

924
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,680
conflict in your shock

925
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,300
um but with that and those are the

926
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,460
customers which which I see most working

927
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,619
most of the time with the miter attack

928
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,480
framework and those were also the ones

929
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,640
two years ago three years ago which

930
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,820
tried to implement all the use cases

931
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,060
so 20 up yeah 20 up and then there were

932
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,680
some The Gardener The Gardener research

933
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,720
had some outliers uh one company

934
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,440
reported 10 000 stock analysts which I

935
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,380
don't think is true but who knows

936
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,440
minions minions probably yeah uh any

937
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,200
questions from the audience

938
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,900
because I have one more and and I'm not

939
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,859
competing for the merge just um

940
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:01,400
uh my uh

941
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,920
second question is that I think you

942
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,440
mentioned possibly in talk but maybe

943
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,020
yesterday when we were

944
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,700
talking uh that you kind of created

945
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,700
let's say not similar or your own

946
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,980
framework yeah before the Metra attack

947
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,800
uh how do you now compare that to

948
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,200
today's life and Mitra what do you need

949
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,680
to and I don't know how much different

950
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,200
it was do you feel it it was going to be

951
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,780
inferior or was it just going in

952
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,760
different the strategical direction or

953
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,859
and what what was it is it still

954
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:43,880
somewhere available it's still available

955
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,220
is still available

956
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,200
payments Association don't try to read

957
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,359
it as another miter attack it is not

958
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,119
it's not a comprehensive lexicon of

959
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,099
every attack technique observed of every

960
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,740
tactic observed what it is it is a

961
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,119
framework to start monitoring your

962
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:03,119
Effectiveness as a sock so it it asks

963
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,560
you for every use case you're running

964
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,020
why are you running this what business

965
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,960
purpose what higher category so for

966
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,640
example if you're running a rule for

967
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,400
DDOS why are you running that you need

968
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,079
to protect your company you need to

969
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,660
protect your company for downtime you

970
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,400
want you need to keep sales running now

971
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,780
if that's an important thing of your

972
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,500
business then yes do those use cases if

973
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,180
it's not don't do them there's companies

974
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,740
who don't care about their website going

975
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,720
down because they deliver water

976
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,400
if they deliver water they care about

977
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,880
water quality not about a website

978
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,160
then the second thing is that framework

979
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,040
also helps you calculate the weight of

980
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,480
the use cases or the Texans you're

981
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,579
running and that's the last slide ahead

982
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,440
if you think you're protected because

983
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,540
you have an EDR and the EDR is only

984
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,300
running on 10 systems on 10 systems of

985
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,400
your thousand people organization you

986
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,380
are not being protected you're protected

987
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,540
not even you're protected a tenth of a

988
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,760
percent and lots of organizations make

989
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,680
the mistake saying if I have a tool

990
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,200
somewhere even if I don't manage it even

991
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,060
if it costs only half of my organization

992
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,460
it's perfect but there's a lot of work

993
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,839
which can be done and that's the

994
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,520
difference between the micro framework

995
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,940
and the big lexicon that's my term and

996
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,940
coming back my first question

997
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,680
would be would the magma be actually

998
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,780
something to start if you are like a

999
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,599
sock of three persons or small so before

1000
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,780
you're kind of like graduate the larger

1001
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,599
guys playground so yeah because I kind

1002
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:33,839
of like I hear the word use case and

1003
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,480
it's probably much more related to what

1004
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,940
people in smaller companies are dealing

1005
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,700
than with all of the threat actors who

1006
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,500
are probably not looking for a small guy

1007
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,660
so much no no use cases are the most

1008
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,760
abuse term and security there's a use

1009
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,020
case which could be a reason for

1010
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,060
acquiring a product there's a use case

1011
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,040
which somebody says no I need to have my

1012
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,480
business running but there's also the

1013
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,099
one as a stock on the list you talk on a

1014
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:57,960
use case you talk about the detection

1015
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,320
rule so it's a really abused term if

1016
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,060
you're running free people in a small

1017
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,000
organization I would focus on a proper

1018
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,040
management of an EDR Solution that's

1019
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,740
about the most you can do

1020
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,240
you might be able to do some fishing if

1021
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,400
you're lucky and some antivirus and

1022
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,720
that's that's usually quite the limit

1023
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,099
that you have to do because if you're

1024
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:19,619
free persons you're mostly also managing

1025
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:21,180
the firewalls or routers you're also

1026
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,280
mostly managing the windows servers so

1027
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,020
you see that with the size that small

1028
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,839
don't start if you get into five five

1029
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,839
peer Persian stocks 10 person socks then

1030
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:33,000
you get this luxury to start thinking of

1031
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,820
who am I what am I trying to defend and

1032
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,980
how to approach that whichever framework

1033
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,520
you choose

1034
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,660
great do you have more questions from

1035
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,078
the audience

1036
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:53,640
I think of no then first thank you to

1037
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,480
you there is a goodie bag for you but I

1038
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,300
do need to thanks

1039
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,140
but you also need to pick one of the

1040
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,780
questions not not mine but from the

1041
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,000
audience yeah which which might have

1042
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,520
been kind of like the

1043
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,099
yeah and then we need to remember who

1044
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:16,320
asked that no I think the the last

1045
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,780
question we had on how do you how do you

1046
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,820
tune it how do you manage the life cycle

1047
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,980
of a detection I've thought what a

1048
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,839
really good question because it's some

1049
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:26,220
something most people don't think about

1050
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,260
and they just keep running after the

1051
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,640
detection so somebody's been thinking

1052
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,640
about how do I manage this uh at a

1053
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,760
constructive way before I need to start

1054
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,040
running again I miss my other parties so

1055
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,660
to this man over there I think of the

1056
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,900
yellow shirt congratulations okay

1057
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,820
