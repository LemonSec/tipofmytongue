[Music]

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,960
attention

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:25,859
[Music]

4
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,259
[Music]

5
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,059
thank you

6
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,239
foreign

7
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,140
Okay cool so

8
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,960
the talk I'm going to be giving is uh

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,260
it's titled minions versus Gru or the

10
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,960
Gru and I want to be discussing sort of

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,840
uh what the role is of Civilian

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,740
Volunteers in cyber War

13
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,780
and uh sort of probably the image they

14
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,180
have of themselves is something like

15
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,040
this but

16
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,080
the reality is

17
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,740
it's it's not even this which would be

18
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,900
at least benign

19
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,100
um

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,880
it's a it's a bit more uh complex and

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,420
nuanced and um actually a bit dangerous

22
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,979
but of course uh the problem is that the

23
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,659
the people who are suffering are

24
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,840
actually not the opposition in this case

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,140
um the role of civilians has basically

26
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,680
been to cause problems for the people

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,259
who are actually trying to do something

28
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,899
so

29
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,360
why am I going to tell you this well I'm

30
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,560
a grug and what I've been doing for the

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,399
last decade I've been doing cyber for 20

32
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,899
something years now but for the last

33
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,599
decade or so a lot of what I focused on

34
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,200
has been research where I do a lot of

35
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,160
um reading and mostly talking to people

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,560
and listening and discussing and finding

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,940
out

38
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,400
how they work uh what they do what's

39
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,780
useful

40
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,120
um sort of learning and understanding

41
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,220
from people who are engaged in

42
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,080
operations at multiple different levels

43
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,540
on the defensive side on the offensive

44
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,040
side

45
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,940
um in you know companies versus in small

46
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,800
groups versus when they're operating

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,540
individually or whatever so a sort of

48
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,140
um I'm speaking here from a position of

49
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,480
having discussed with a large number of

50
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,500
people who have uh first hand insight

51
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,900
into what's going on and I've

52
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,780
synthesized that sort of trying to bring

53
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,160
that out now in a cohesive narrative and

54
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,739
we will see if I succeed

55
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,879
and the approach that we're going to go

56
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,680
through is basically a brief

57
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,379
introduction to um not you I don't know

58
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,519
if you guys are familiar with this but

59
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,440
uh there's actually a war going on in

60
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,120
Ukraine

61
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,180
um and there's been a cyber component so

62
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,040
we're going to be talking about

63
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,080
uh sort of why this war is unique uh why

64
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,300
there is cyber and War and what cyber

65
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,920
and War does uh we're going to be

66
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,300
talking about the sort of the players

67
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,760
the hacks that they've done

68
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,760
the lessons that can be learned uh you

69
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,260
know bearing in mind of course that in

70
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,540
the middle of awards are not the ideal

71
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,500
time to draw conclusions based on public

72
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,260
and uh you know hearsay information you

73
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,060
know we're going to we're going to look

74
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,319
at what we can

75
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,720
um and then sort of close it out and I

76
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,360
should also point out that this overview

77
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,000
I think is out of order

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,920
but anyway we're going to be hitting

79
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,140
these topics if not necessarily in this

80
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,140
order and uh this image is here to let

81
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,519
you know that there are things that seem

82
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,220
one way but they're not

83
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,240
now it's about uh deceptional stuff okay

84
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,620
so

85
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,199
if you take nothing else away

86
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,220
right

87
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,740
this is what you should remember

88
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,919
do not allow civilian volunteers to hack

89
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:38,340
inside your area of operations

90
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,720
right it is not what you want they are

91
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,600
the opposite of what is useful if you

92
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,660
are trying to run a war

93
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,199
um I will get into more details on how

94
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,440
and why and

95
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,340
let's go so very quickly we need to sort

96
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,840
of um

97
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,520
just go over like there's multiple

98
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,240
layers of War uh this is not necessarily

99
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,180
relevant but it's important to know uh

100
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,160
when we're doing analysis so you've got

101
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,380
the Strategic layer which is sort of um

102
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,240
the broader understanding of like what

103
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,180
you're trying to do and uh where you

104
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,560
need to be in order to do it or sort of

105
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,419
the objectives you need to have to

106
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,400
achieve those ultimate goals

107
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,080
then you've got sort of operational

108
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,660
which is the how do you take your things

109
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,759
to the places they need to be to do the

110
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,940
stuff that you want or how do you uh

111
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,560
like how do you achieve the objectives

112
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,639
that you want to achieve with the

113
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,440
resources that you have

114
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,259
and then we sort of have the Tactical

115
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,479
which is the like what do you do once

116
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,860
you get there like what what do you do

117
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,060
to actually achieve those objectives and

118
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,520
um as you can see like with these three

119
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,699
layers basically uh the higher up the

120
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,800
more influence the state needs to have

121
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,360
and what's happening and as it goes

122
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,860
lower down

123
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,639
um

124
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,039
it sort of it becomes a smaller scale

125
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,380
thing and people can get involved and so

126
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,419
sort of the takeaway from this is that

127
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,479
where the civilian volunteers get

128
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,240
involved is at the Tactical layer which

129
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,840
is sort of not really the most useful

130
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,120
layer to have people just show up in

131
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,919
particularly if they're not integrated

132
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,240
into the previous layers

133
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,120
um so about the war

134
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,740
this is a valuable uh cauldron of

135
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,780
um basically like an experiment to see

136
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,060
what happens in a real peer competition

137
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,759
with cyber where there's a significant

138
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,220
part of uh the war is actually taking

139
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,560
place in cyber

140
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,300
a large part of that is actually

141
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,340
information operations and the

142
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,560
ukrainians have been absolutely smashing

143
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,660
it on that one the ukrainians are just

144
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,940
dominating and

145
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,460
um it'll be interesting to look at why I

146
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,860
think there are a number of cool reasons

147
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,100
one of them is that the ukrainians are

148
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,919
led by a sort of like a young comedian

149
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,419
who has a smartphone and is clued in and

150
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:10,740
comedians are useful because the

151
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,840
instrument that the comedian plays is

152
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,979
the audience

153
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,919
you know they they learn to connect with

154
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,340
people and uh sort of interact and get

155
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,380
reactions out of them that's incredibly

156
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,720
useful if you are trying to do

157
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,639
information operations

158
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,360
um

159
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,759
anyway I actually do not have time to go

160
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,240
into this so the um the majority of the

161
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,680
Cyber effects that we saw were actually

162
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,900
during that initial Invasion phase

163
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,599
particularly during the first day

164
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,280
um this was done by Russia where they

165
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,580
were able to successfully uh isolate and

166
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,500
they were able to isolate the commanders

167
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,060
and they were able to disrupt the

168
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,819
command and control channels uh this was

169
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,880
very effective in disrupting control and

170
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,819
um also immobilization but the Russians

171
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,759
were unable to exploit this for a number

172
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,800
of reasons

173
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,460
um

174
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,500
but you know that's the important thing

175
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,599
to remember is it was successful but

176
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:11,280
then um that wasn't sufficient in itself

177
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,099
um since then cyber has not been

178
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:15,840
particularly tightly integrated into

179
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,919
operations and part of that is an

180
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,539
inflexible Force structure that the

181
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,879
Russians have where the operational

182
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,680
control

183
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,960
um at the like the actual thin edge of

184
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,720
the wedge does not have control over

185
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,640
cyber operations that's done from back

186
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,080
in headquarters so there's this

187
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,020
disconnect and stuff but

188
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,419
there's sort of a lot of different

189
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,479
reasons right like maybe there's nothing

190
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,760
useful to hack like what exactly are you

191
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,020
supposed to do with the DDOS that's

192
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,760
going to fill

193
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,519
um you know a tanks diesel like that's

194
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,560
not going to help uh there's not a lot

195
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,000
of cyber that you can do that's going to

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,880
help in artillery barrages

197
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,620
um you know it could be that there's no

198
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,300
strategic direction or there's no

199
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,019
resources so no one cares you know like

200
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:05,820
there's any number of reasons and we

201
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,399
don't know and uh the reason this is

202
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,320
important is it's important not to draw

203
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,880
lessons

204
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,000
just because something hasn't happened

205
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,339
doesn't mean it's

206
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,019
um you know it shouldn't happen during

207
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:20,880
this phase it's not an indictment of

208
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,100
cyber that it hasn't been used it simply

209
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,839
says in these contacts with these

210
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,760
circumstances it hasn't been used

211
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,980
so it's important to sort of not try and

212
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,620
draw too many lessons

213
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,680
um what we've seen in terms of actual

214
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,440
use has been very tactical right it was

215
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,040
the use of you know deny degrade disrupt

216
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,080
uh targeting of government systems

217
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,700
critical National infrastructure was

218
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,980
targeted once and it failed but

219
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,080
generally speaking it was this initial

220
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,740
short sharp strike and then pretty much

221
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,660
nothing there's been a lot of Espionage

222
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,519
there's been

223
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,880
um some other attacks that have happened

224
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,380
the the major cyber attacks that have

225
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,540
happened have been outside of Ukraine as

226
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,220
more of a signaling effort which we will

227
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,320
get to

228
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,760
in many minutes

229
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,240
but with that sort of said you know like

230
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,760
that's the Cyber that we have had in the

231
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,560
war so far uh let's talk about cyber war

232
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,240
and before we go on I just want to

233
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,339
interject for a minute because what

234
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,019
you're referring to as cyber war is in

235
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,660
fact cyber War as I've recently taken to

236
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,000
calling it cyber plus War

237
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,040
so cyber is not a war fighting domain

238
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,260
unto itself

239
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,380
um the problem with the term cyber war

240
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,100
is it sort of creates the idea of a

241
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,080
conflict domain that exists in isolation

242
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,000
of everything else right like if you

243
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
talk about air War you don't assume that

244
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,040
there's like no infantry involved or

245
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,540
that the the Navy doesn't matter anymore

246
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,240
you know it's it's part of an integrated

247
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,339
operation there's an entire thing going

248
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,680
on including the state behind it itself

249
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,740
being actively involved in many ways to

250
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,779
prosecute that war it's not done in

251
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,880
isolation and similarly

252
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,760
cyber war will not be done in isolation

253
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,620
it's not a thing that can just happen

254
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,040
that doesn't exist as a platonic ideal

255
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,200
it is something that has to be part of

256
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,480
you know a complete balanced War

257
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,980
um and what that means of course is that

258
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,800
Wars will now have cyber elements and

259
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,260
we're starting to see that we've seen

260
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,060
um it hasn't really been talked about

261
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,779
but in uh no go on karabakh that was

262
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:35,760
quite a lot of cyber stuff that went on

263
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,040
it was very interesting we're going to

264
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,160
be seeing a lot more in the future so

265
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,260
it's valuable to know about that so

266
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,160
let's start talking about you know where

267
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,279
cyber fits in war

268
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,760
and that's easy so when we think about

269
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,800
creating a warfighting capability inside

270
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,660
cyberspace for part of our strategic

271
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,579
intent and we're looking at doing a

272
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,459
global effects integration and like

273
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:04,140
I mean what the if it's called like

274
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,700
The Art of War why are there no drawings

275
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,180
right like this is rubbish

276
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,040
um instead I think

277
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,040
uh probably the most important thing to

278
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,740
remember is that cyber attacks are not

279
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,680
attacks all right like no one dies

280
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,260
nothing gets blown up like it's not

281
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,500
actually that big a deal in like the

282
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,779
middle of a war it is something that

283
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,180
could be used to uh augment or

284
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,300
supplement or assist with another attack

285
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,800
but

286
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,140
in and of itself it's not

287
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,940
an attack

288
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,700
um you know and and similarly you can't

289
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,440
really say like

290
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,660
uh this addressed a bit of the the legal

291
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,920
thing but you know if people are

292
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,800
participating in a DDOS against Russia

293
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,180
does that mean that they've become

294
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,380
combatants

295
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,779
on the one hand yes they're now

296
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,639
participating in the war but on the

297
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,639
other hand it's not really an attack so

298
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,639
no they're participating in a crime

299
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,279
um it's not part of a war

300
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,899
Okay so

301
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,260
let's talk about what actual cyber

302
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,820
warfare is and a big caveat up front is

303
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,620
this is wrong like the taxonomy I'm

304
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,160
about to give you is not uh a it's not

305
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,720
used anywhere

306
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,120
um I don't think it's absolutely correct

307
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,459
but I do think it's useful I think it is

308
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:30,420
uh valuable to use these uh these stages

309
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,079
to sort of understand how civilians can

310
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,399
participate in what's actually happening

311
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,519
and these are the three things so we

312
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,480
have Espionage information and effects

313
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,019
um Espionage is basically collecting

314
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,899
information or perhaps subtle sorts of

315
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,339
influence

316
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,680
um that can be done sort of stealthily

317
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,779
and whatever but it's

318
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,060
it's not visible you know it's something

319
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,820
that happens uh covertly and in the

320
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,100
shadows it's heavy on stealth it's just

321
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,139
not an exciting thing that's going to

322
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,180
get reported on uh information

323
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,220
operations on the other hand tend not to

324
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,120
be treated as cyber because they're

325
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,279
basically what PR companies do or

326
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,579
marketing or whatever they do not have

327
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,860
um the sort of like offensive cyber

328
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,519
operations uh bling going on

329
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:30,000
but they are very very useful

330
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,040
um particularly strategically in terms

331
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,600
of making sure that your allies remain

332
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,639
on board so you know an information

333
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,680
operation will help you sort of shape

334
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,540
the information environment which will

335
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,779
then hopefully lead to influencing the

336
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:46,560
behavior of the target audience and

337
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,959
the big one of course is the effect

338
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,820
operations which

339
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,100
um like even this terminology is a

340
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,959
little bit out of favor now but again

341
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,579
the idea here is just to be able to

342
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,680
understand that you've got like

343
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,060
um stealthy stuff that no one knows

344
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,760
about talking about stuff which no one

345
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,040
cares about and then actually doing

346
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,279
things which look cool and

347
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,420
um those are sort of like the three

348
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,699
groups and the effects are the stuff

349
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,980
that like looks really cool and the idea

350
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,560
is that somehow it will help you in some

351
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,800
way that's the overall goal

352
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,100
um but Espionage is actually useful like

353
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,199
out of all of this stuff it's the most

354
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,600
boring but it's also the most valuable

355
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,540
like you can actually do things with it

356
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,360
um it actually directly helps you

357
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,579
prosecute a war

358
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,519
um information operations again really

359
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,339
really important being able to shape the

360
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,079
behavior of your opposition and your

361
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,720
allies absolutely vital to being able to

362
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,139
win a war like you want it so that

363
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:49,680
um

364
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,839
your allies stay on your side and that

365
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,680
your enemy sort of lose uh lose heart

366
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,880
and don't want to keep fighting anymore

367
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,459
like that's what you're going for and

368
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,339
then you've got effects which

369
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:03,899
um I mean they're a lot more exciting

370
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,760
than just grapping through someone's

371
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,160
emails to see like if there's anything

372
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,279
interesting uh these sort of things like

373
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,440
they seem really cool you've got your

374
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,880
DDOS you've got your defacements you've

375
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,800
got like putting stuff on someone else's

376
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,040
TV or playing things from hacked radios

377
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,139
or you know whatever like all of this

378
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:25,519
stuff is just it's flashy and it's cool

379
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,339
and you know it's not that useful uh

380
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,199
unless it's part of an actual operation

381
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,639
so

382
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,380
where does that leave us well we've got

383
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,920
cyber we've got war and

384
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,740
who do we have playing in uh the Cyber

385
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,959
War that's actually going on right now

386
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,480
so if we look at the Players

387
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,279
um they sort of fall into two groups

388
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,779
you've got your state actors on the one

389
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,940
hand and you also have non-state actors

390
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,839
so the state actors are by and large

391
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,480
not that interesting

392
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,199
um

393
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,839
sort of to look at like if they do good

394
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:02,459
stuff but most of the time what they're

395
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:05,459
doing is espionage there's very few who

396
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,959
are involved in actual effects

397
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,819
operations

398
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,500
um and of course the reason for that is

399
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,660
as we've talked about like it's because

400
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,900
Espionage is actually very useful so uh

401
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,220
when we're talking about State actors

402
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,079
we're talking typically about State

403
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,299
security forces and I'm going to hit

404
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:24,480
next and hope that I have a slide but

405
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,900
yeah look at that okay so

406
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,540
um basically on the Ukrainian side we've

407
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,260
got the sbu which is sort of like uh the

408
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,880
KGB but not uh the gur which is like the

409
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,940
gru but not basically so you've got your

410
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,400
uh State intelligence service you've got

411
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,220
your military intelligence service

412
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,740
there's also the police who have some

413
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,600
degree of uh cyber capability

414
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,660
particularly because uh a not

415
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,640
insignificant not insignificant number

416
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,460
of them used to be cyber criminals who

417
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,260
have been sort of coerced into working

418
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,900
so they do have some capability and they

419
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,919
have

420
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:06,360
um historically at least they've wanted

421
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,240
to participate as far as I know they are

422
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,700
not doing that they are not um

423
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,500
conducting their own cyber operations

424
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,200
but you know don't quote me on that one

425
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,240
as far as I know the Cyber operations

426
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,980
are being done only by uh sbu gur and

427
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,320
any contractors or whatever that they

428
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,820
might have working for them just like

429
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,820
NSA has got Raytheon and so on

430
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,320
the other hand

431
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,900
um you know in in the Red Corner we have

432
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,179
Russia who has

433
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,419
um the primary uh sort of operator in

434
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:42,360
this uh this war so far has been the gru

435
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,340
they've done all the effects they do a

436
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,919
lot of the Espionage

437
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,480
um I guess as FSB is trying to wash

438
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,679
their hands of it because they don't

439
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,900
want to be tainted

440
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,240
um with you know the catastrophe

441
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,020
but um yeah FSB sort of has control of

442
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,140
Espionage over the near abroad I'm not

443
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,400
sure if you guys are familiar with the

444
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,500
way that you know Russia considers its

445
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,440
uh former satellite States this might be

446
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,700
a bit foreign to you I know that the

447
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,220
baltics is very far away from

448
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,799
um you know Ukraine and stuff so anyway

449
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,600
I'll skip over that but yeah like

450
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,840
basically you don't get svr operating in

451
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,940
Ukraine very much because it's not part

452
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,580
of their agreement

453
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,820
um the one interesting thing is that

454
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,980
Russia also has cyber criminals in

455
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,160
particular Conti who have uh begun

456
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,919
working for the state and uh what's

457
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,440
become I think quite interesting is that

458
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,059
the way that their operations have

459
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:42,780
evolved show increased integration with

460
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,240
State operations

461
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,799
particularly the the state command

462
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,600
structure

463
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,000
um and I really hope I've got slides on

464
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,620
that okay

465
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,020
non-state actors on the other hand is

466
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,650
where we've got this huge mess

467
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:58,980
[Music]

468
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,940
um

469
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,880
so we've got like the Ukrainian aligned

470
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,419
non-state actress starting with

471
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:11,160
the I.T cyber Army and

472
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,520
so briefly about the I.T cyber Army um

473
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,200
when Ukraine was initially invaded they

474
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,020
panicked as one does being invaded and

475
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,140
everyone who had a half reasonably

476
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,299
sounding idea and pitched it to the

477
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,240
government basically got greenlighted so

478
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,160
this guy came up with the idea of

479
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,280
starting a sort of like volunteer force

480
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,520
of cyber hacker operator types who would

481
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,299
come and help Ukraine cyber hacker

482
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,440
operate

483
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,600
and like that was okay so they basically

484
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,400
put out this call and said hey you know

485
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,220
everyone please come and help us

486
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,200
and um

487
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,940
that attracted quite a lot of people

488
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,640
they did show up to help and there was a

489
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,080
lot of DDOS there were a lot of

490
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,000
defacement

491
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,520
um there were a bunch of cyber criminals

492
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,919
who got involved and

493
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,799
sort of what what this reflected was

494
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,140
um there's this dichotomy between uh so

495
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,179
you basically have two types of

496
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:13,440
followers that you get on these things

497
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,900
as uh the sympathizers and supporters so

498
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,000
sympathizers show up and they're like I

499
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,860
feel strongly about this this is really

500
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,660
important to me but

501
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,260
um

502
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,419
you know it's getting on past eight

503
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,179
o'clock and I've got a thing so you know

504
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:32,520
I'm here to show my support but I won't

505
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,900
be here and then you know like not

506
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,059
showing up the next week and so on where

507
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:39,059
supporters are sort of more consistent

508
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:42,840
and uh we saw that with basically the

509
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,059
the sort of level of activity and the

510
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:47,039
number of people involved the early

511
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,559
phases of the war particularly in the

512
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,980
first two weeks uh two or three weeks so

513
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,200
a lot of activity and then it sort of

514
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,840
died off fairly rapidly

515
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,059
um basically the the criminals got bored

516
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,039
and stopped doing defacements all the

517
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,659
people doing DDOS sort of had other

518
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:06,419
better things to do at their time

519
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:07,500
um there's still a lot of people

520
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,460
involved but it is uh a lot smaller than

521
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,340
it was before they are not necessarily

522
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,900
more skilled now than they used to be

523
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,200
but I'm not going to go deeply into the

524
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,299
organization of uh the it Army because

525
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,880
one of the most important things about

526
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,919
the it Army is the media coverage that

527
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,600
they have gotten because

528
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,880
the media coverage does not accurately

529
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,700
reflect the reality of what they're

530
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,500
doing

531
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,620
it has had the effect of attracting more

532
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,460
volunteers and since the it Army has

533
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,299
been causing problems the um like their

534
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:50,820
operations and the coverage that they've

535
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,059
received has caused issues for actual

536
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:56,880
legitimate real operations that are

537
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,780
being done by you know Ukraine and their

538
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,460
allies

539
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,720
so

540
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,580
more volunteers has actually just made

541
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,460
things worse so the coverage

542
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,400
you know it represented what was

543
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,679
happening uh it showed that it made more

544
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,000
people show up brought in more

545
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,440
sympathizers

546
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,799
uh and it ended up alerting the Russians

547
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:23,460
and it caused a huge shift in the

548
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,640
security posture of Russian

549
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,720
um systems so for you know the the first

550
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,120
month or so while all of this coverage

551
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,520
is going on

552
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,080
Russians started getting a lot more

553
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,840
secure like they worked hard they you

554
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,179
know um like we can go into basically

555
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:44,340
like when there was a DDOS going on it

556
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,960
meant that there was no traffic that

557
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,720
could be sent from you know a legitimate

558
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,159
cyber operators who are trying to hack

559
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,200
something if there was low hanging fruit

560
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,559
and it got uh grabbed by some random

561
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,140
person in the U.S who then did a

562
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,780
defacement it meant that that access was

563
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,780
not available to legitimate operators

564
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,400
who might have been able to do something

565
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,159
much more useful with it

566
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,799
um it meant that people who had low

567
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,440
hanging fruit

568
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,880
were motivated to go and secure things

569
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,559
because

570
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,299
they saw all the media coverage of what

571
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:19,559
was going on and they didn't want to get

572
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,140
hacked so certain things that could have

573
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,980
been hit they were shut off

574
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,419
um again things like the you know um

575
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:33,059
there's a friend of mine and we were in

576
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,220
a discussion and someone said basically

577
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,200
like um but you know all of those

578
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,000
attacks is useful like it's noise you

579
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,320
can hide in the noise you know they

580
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,080
won't be able to see you and the my

581
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,820
friend was like yeah it's noise for me

582
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,520
too like I can't see anyway like it it

583
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,120
it covers everyone like noise is noise

584
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,480
it's not useful it's just a problem

585
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,840
and that sort of the thing that I think

586
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,080
has not been understood uh particularly

587
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,500
uh outside of the media and also in um

588
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,400
don't leave I can see you on the camera

589
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,620
okay

590
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,559
so it hasn't been understood by analysts

591
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:17,159
and I'm not gonna name where this is

592
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:18,240
from but

593
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,280
this is a very very relevant quote

594
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,900
because it cracked me up when I read it

595
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,860
basically

596
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,640
um

597
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,679
he says like

598
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,740
the it Army make like it makes no sense

599
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,840
that the defense and intelligence

600
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,419
Services basically just did nothing and

601
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:35,520
allowed the I.T Army to conduct

602
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,820
operations freely and independently

603
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,279
because that would highly likely also

604
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,440
lead to strategic confusion and tactical

605
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,940
interference with the defense and

606
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,279
intelligence Services own operations in

607
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,080
cyberspace

608
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,299
you think

609
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,559
like

610
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,120
what did you think happened

611
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,679
so

612
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:01,919
you know like the obvious problems are

613
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,100
obvious but people have assumed that

614
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,220
basically given how

615
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:08,820
um

616
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,059
like important it is to not have these

617
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:13,679
problems

618
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,620
obviously no one would actually do

619
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,960
something this dumb like that makes no

620
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,640
sense it's got to be a lot smarter than

621
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,580
that and it's not like it's really not

622
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,559
any smarter than it seems it is actually

623
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,000
that dumb

624
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,320
and

625
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,480
um that's sort of one of the problems

626
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,100
here and why it's sort of unfortunate is

627
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,400
that you've got these uh guys trying to

628
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,620
do a job and you've got people trying to

629
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,039
play a game and the game players really

630
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,380
shouldn't be around here uh one

631
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,419
of the things that gets set a lot um if

632
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:46,860
you see interviews with people who have

633
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,460
volunteered to go and fight

634
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,620
um they always say like it's not Call of

635
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,360
Duty you know if you don't have military

636
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,820
experience if you don't have

637
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,320
um you know the background you shouldn't

638
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,279
be here

639
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,720
and

640
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,279
I think

641
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:05,120
um that sentiment needs to be understood

642
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,659
for cyber as well like it's not a game

643
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:13,440
when you know uh someone does something

644
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,140
in Russia that causes that asset to no

645
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,120
longer be available to a legitimate

646
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,400
operator it's not a cool thing it wasn't

647
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,159
like clever it's a problem

648
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,740
um it outside of the Strategic control

649
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,840
and strategic hierarchy without being

650
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,179
integrated into how the whole war is

651
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:32,940
being fought anything that is done by

652
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,179
these independent groups is wasted at

653
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,460
like the best case scenario is it's

654
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,220
completely wasted but realistically it

655
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,400
is negative in some aspect like it's

656
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,400
either raising the security awareness of

657
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,260
the other side it's cutting off access

658
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,179
it's obscuring something it's

659
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:52,799
interrupting and interfering with acting

660
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,020
like ongoing operations

661
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,480
um like stop it don't do it

662
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,260
um

663
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,480
all right so that's the I.T cyber Army

664
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,299
there's also been uh Anonymous who sort

665
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:06,179
of like they rocked up early on they did

666
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:09,299
some DDOS some defacements you know and

667
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:12,299
then they kind of they got bored

668
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,860
um the

669
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,679
the major use of anonymous as far as I'm

670
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:18,419
aware now is it's just used as an

671
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:19,860
umbrella organization

672
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,380
for um much more interesting groups

673
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,559
which I'm calling tiger teams

674
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:29,640
um basically these are groups of

675
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,880
um experience cyber security

676
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,260
professionals who have

677
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,840
strong motivations and are turning their

678
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,220
skills towards acting to assist in a way

679
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,480
that they can and these people have been

680
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,900
um doing a lot of stuff and I think the

681
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,100
the thing to understand is the

682
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,200
difference between them and the I.T

683
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,120
cyber Army is the operations that these

684
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
guys are doing are much more focused

685
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,039
they're still not integrated in the same

686
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,140
way that they should be in order to be

687
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,559
truly useful but they are not as

688
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,380
problematic they don't cause the same

689
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,279
level of issues and so

690
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,559
um just sort of like the the connection

691
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,940
that these guys have to Anonymous is

692
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,520
like they're not actually part of the

693
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,960
anonymous group like they don't join the

694
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,980
channels they don't discuss anything

695
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,620
they don't do any of that stuff but a

696
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,260
lot of their operations get attributed

697
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,080
to Anonymous and that's fine by everyone

698
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,700
like Anonymous is not going to say we

699
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,500
didn't do that and these guys are not

700
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,940
going to come out and be like no no that

701
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,260
was me

702
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,320
um they want it this way so

703
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,360
basically

704
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,840
if you see a really impressive cool hack

705
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,179
almost every time it's going to be the

706
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:52,860
work of a tiger team or similar like the

707
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,080
state does not have capacity to just

708
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,580
 around they don't run non-essential

709
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,279
non-essential operations they don't

710
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,559
um they don't have the time to put into

711
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,840
you know putting something on TV just

712
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,760
for the hell of it when they could use

713
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,640
that to try and gain access to like the

714
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,760
logistics back end and learn what the um

715
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,039
like the depth of the reinforcement

716
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,080
situation is you know like they have

717
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,179
important things to do and it does not

718
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,480
include playing around so almost any

719
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,360
time you see like a clever Fun hack it

720
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,580
was done by someone who's not the state

721
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,760
and it was not directed by the state

722
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,480
um

723
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,640
Okay so

724
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,799
that's kind of like the Ukrainian line

725
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:40,140
side on the Russian side things are a

726
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,059
bit different we have

727
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:45,179
um mostly sort of

728
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:48,539
um Russian uh State linked and

729
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:50,039
controlled groups

730
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,360
so we've sort of got like the the

731
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,700
killnet hacknet stuff going on

732
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,659
um these guys they are very very closely

733
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,700
coordinated with the military

734
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,320
um they have done a lot of high

735
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,440
visibility effects operations

736
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,840
they clearly take Direction on what

737
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,580
they're supposed to do and that

738
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,440
direction make sure that their

739
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,179
operations are strategically aligned

740
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:16,760
with the interests of the Russian state

741
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,039
um

742
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,380
so they they play this big game about

743
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,200
how you know like they're independent

744
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,059
and patriotic and whatever and they're

745
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,760
clearly not um I don't think anyone buys

746
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,779
that

747
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:38,520
uh then we have conti and Conti has done

748
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,020
um an interesting thing like clearly

749
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,179
they've got some connection with fsp as

750
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:43,620
we saw from the leaks

751
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,140
and

752
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,140
it seems that some portion of Conti has

753
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:53,880
uh Gone on to doing exclusively uh

754
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,360
Ukraine targeted hacks to assist the

755
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,580
Russian state in some way

756
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,340
um and what we've seen over time is that

757
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:06,000
those hacks have gone from being

758
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,179
um sort of a little bit more obvious

759
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,520
easy to catch and less focused to being

760
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,640
more stealthy and more clearly focused

761
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,679
which I think shows a tighter

762
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:20,279
operational control in targeting and in

763
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:24,480
being able to sort of realize the value

764
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,520
from this group like there's more

765
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,860
interest from the command structure

766
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,399
um this is ironically from imotet who is

767
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,760
in Ukraine but basically like this is

768
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,659
the like this is a realistic state of

769
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:43,620
you know the professional cyber Criminal

770
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,179
um

771
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:48,299
okay so that was abrupt um let's look at

772
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,159
some of the things that have happened in

773
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,480
the cybers

774
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,340
um stuff that Anonymous has been

775
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,320
associated with

776
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,380
so there's been a lot of data leaks via

777
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,120
DDOS Secrets

778
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,179
um why this is good is that it's

779
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:05,399
provided a lot of data leaks the

780
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:08,039
downside of course is that there is so

781
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,440
much that has been leaked that it is not

782
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,840
possible to analyze it there's just too

783
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,779
much information it's not

784
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:17,580
um it's not accessible

785
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,399
in a way that can be looked at so who

786
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,899
really knows what's in there

787
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,659
uh it's interesting and maybe someone

788
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:26,039
will find something valuable but it's

789
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:28,320
just been a flood of

790
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,880
um data that no one can do anything with

791
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,620
really

792
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,460
um they've done a bunch of like amusing

793
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,539
things uh of of little to no consequence

794
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:42,299
um more towards no consequence uh so

795
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:44,700
like you know the TV stations have been

796
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,860
hacked they play like Ukrainian

797
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,019
patriotic music

798
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:49,940
um

799
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,279
on Independence Day a bunch of IP

800
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,740
cameras were hacked and they played the

801
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,659
Ukrainian national anthem all across

802
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:00,299
Russia there's a video put out it's kind

803
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:02,299
of amusing but

804
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:04,980
you know it didn't exactly stop the war

805
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,500
it didn't cause protests you know it's

806
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,460
just

807
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,280
uh it's amusing

808
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,239
um

809
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,219
the one exception to an effects

810
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,379
operation that was visible that I I

811
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:20,159
believe is actually was not done by

812
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,500
um independent civilian operators that

813
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,839
was actually done by a state-controlled

814
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:27,839
security force is when

815
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,659
um the Crimean TV was hacked and it

816
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:33,000
played an address from zelenski and I

817
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,918
believe that this was coordinated with

818
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:37,619
the states because it happened during an

819
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:38,879
offensive

820
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,440
um I believe it was the start of the

821
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,440
cares on offensive so

822
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,500
this was due to the timing this was I

823
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,199
believe obviously linked to State

824
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,239
security services and

825
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,699
the difference is sort of Fairly clear

826
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,320
on the one hand you've got you know

827
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,200
something being hacked randomly and like

828
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,540
playing music whenever and then you've

829
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,040
got something that is playing an address

830
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,580
to the people of an occupied region

831
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,700
which is being assaulted by the

832
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,220
Ukrainian military you know it's very

833
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,040
clearly linked to actual military

834
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,200
operations

835
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,640
um on the Russian side we've got like

836
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,839
the various Russia Nets and they've done

837
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,119
things which are very clearly signaling

838
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,119
for the state so

839
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,359
um there was a DDOS against Lithuania uh

840
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:34,220
for you know reasons

841
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:41,460
um then there was this very interesting

842
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,980
attack which didn't get a lot of press

843
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,200
um it was in June

844
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,099
I believe or perhaps very early July and

845
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:53,220
about an hour before a missile attack on

846
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,640
Odessa there was a call for

847
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,599
um

848
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,420
basically DDOS and other attacks against

849
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,300
the Odessa air raid systems

850
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,960
and that is very interesting because it

851
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,320
demonstrates an operational link between

852
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,280
the military and this group but it also

853
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,320
suggests that part of what they are

854
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,560
looking at is ways to make

855
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,980
um attacks against civilians have higher

856
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,740
casualty rates right like I think that

857
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,720
that's very interesting um this sort of

858
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,339
thing of going against air raid systems

859
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:32,520
the Palestinians have done in Israel as

860
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,099
well so like this is a tried and true

861
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:40,079
known uh way of going against a state so

862
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,000
it's interesting to see it showing up

863
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,480
here as well

864
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,020
um

865
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,060
so having looked at like some of the

866
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,740
players and some of the hacks I want to

867
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,140
talk about like the reason that you have

868
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,240
cyber like if you're fighting a war the

869
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,500
reason you have cyber is you want to be

870
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,780
able to exploit it right it's got to do

871
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,980
something for you like the entire value

872
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,780
like the entire point of having the

873
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,420
Cyber is that it gains you some

874
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,460
advantage and then you can exploit that

875
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,040
Advantage so it has to do something that

876
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,800
helps you and you can then take

877
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,540
advantage of that help you can you know

878
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,540
exploit it and

879
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,480
that sort of like that's a way to think

880
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,839
about the value that the it Army brings

881
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:27,000
like what's the point if it's not

882
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,280
helping you what's the point like what's

883
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,740
the value

884
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,020
so some of the things that have been

885
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,560
um amusing have been sort of uh like

886
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,380
rationales for why the Cyber Army does

887
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,000
what they do

888
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,740
um I haven't seen one from them but

889
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,320
commentators have said things like

890
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,079
um these guys talk about how they want

891
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:52,260
to make sure that the Russian hackers

892
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,940
are too busy defending that they don't

893
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,440
have time to attack

894
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,380
and I would like to believe that that

895
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,540
was invented by the reporters and not

896
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,180
actually said by the Army because

897
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,240
they if if they said that then they do

898
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,619
not understand that there are two

899
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,240
completely different resource groups

900
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,800
available like the gru is not securing

901
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,740
the uh servers for the TV

902
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,240
station like that's not a thing that

903
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,640
they do you can hack the TV station all

904
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,140
you want and it will not interfere with

905
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,300
a single minutes worth of work from the

906
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,940
gru like that that's like that's not how

907
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,980
it works

908
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,119
ah anyway so what's actually useful

909
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,579
um Espionage Espionage is really good

910
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:39,720
right it's massively underrated but you

911
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,640
know in the middle of a war knowing what

912
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,079
the adversary knows and what they're

913
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:45,359
doing that's very very useful stuff like

914
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,000
you can actually do something with that

915
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,099
um if you know about your enemy you can

916
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:53,820
uh start to influence their thinking you

917
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,619
can start to

918
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:57,260
um you know

919
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,420
prepare things surprises for them you

920
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,740
can start targeting their command

921
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,619
centers you can do a lot of stuff that

922
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:06,359
is actually useful in Prosecuting the

923
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:07,619
war

924
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:10,859
um but playing pranks like that's not

925
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:13,440
Mission critical that's not very helpful

926
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,619
so sort of uh collection is better than

927
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:19,380
information is better than effects which

928
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,640
um you know as I said before like this

929
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,099
is a lie that's not really how it works

930
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:26,640
but it's a useful way of thinking about

931
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,680
it sort of generally and at a broad

932
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,920
level to understand one aspect

933
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,700
um information operations again

934
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,099
they're useful right shaping the

935
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:40,260
information environment changes how

936
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,599
people behave because you impact their

937
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,700
sense making like that's really

938
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,619
important it's especially important when

939
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:48,000
you're talking about your allies because

940
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,380
you want them to continue to support

941
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,060
your efforts

942
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,180
um it's useful though not necessarily uh

943
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,380
against the enemy because you want to

944
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,720
confuse them or deceive them make them

945
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,720
depressed make them lose morale distress

946
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,640
them you want to do it to your own

947
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,960
people to make sure that they maintain

948
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,940
the will to fight because you know the

949
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,220
war is a contest of wills and so you

950
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,440
want to keep that up

951
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,540
um and in a way you could sort of say

952
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,560
like everything is an information

953
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,880
operation

954
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,760
um yeah you could go that far but anyway

955
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,880
like they're useful

956
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,940
but you know they don't really get the

957
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,500
attention that affects operations do

958
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,420
because effects operations look really

959
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:31,560
cool and they're flashy and so

960
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,940
you sort of

961
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,920
um like when we think about effects

962
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,740
operations it's worthwhile to sort of

963
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:41,400
break them down into uh sort of elements

964
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,800
that they consist of so there's the

965
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,420
thing itself like the effect itself like

966
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,760
uh if you disable if you deface a

967
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,320
website like the website isn't

968
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,000
self-defense that's a thing that's the

969
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,900
effect

970
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,400
but then there's also the perception of

971
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,440
the effect like does this mean that the

972
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,359
company running that website is no

973
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,800
longer secure has other data being

974
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,599
compromised

975
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:01,800
um does this mean that they don't care

976
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,180
about their users and they haven't spent

977
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,920
enough money on protection you know like

978
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,200
there's the perception and then there's

979
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,359
sort of like the psychological impact as

980
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,640
well which is the like oh my God they're

981
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,260
dominating Us in cyber we're being

982
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,940
hacked this is terrifying they could be

983
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,380
anywhere like what if they do the banks

984
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,240
next

985
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,820
um these other aspects like the

986
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,839
perception and the psychological impact

987
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,839
they uh like you acclimate to them like

988
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,200
the more it happens the less impressive

989
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,020
it is so for example uh now the

990
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,820
ukrainians have had eight years of

991
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,680
Russian cyber and there's very little

992
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,420
psychological impact

993
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,160
from being hacked like it just it

994
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,960
doesn't really phase them that much

995
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,579
because it's a thing that happens all

996
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:46,880
the time

997
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,660
um and

998
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,700
it's worth keeping this in mind because

999
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,560
the stuff that the civilians are doing

1000
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,839
as volunteers are effects operations

1001
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:56,640
which means that they are making these

1002
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,480
effects Less impactful in future

1003
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,880
um not necessarily critical but

1004
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,160
something to keep in mind

1005
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,339
um similarly you know the quote from uh

1006
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,740
Bonaparte of the

1007
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,599
you must not fight with one enemy for

1008
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:14,099
too long or else you will teach him all

1009
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:15,540
your Art of War

1010
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,640
um and that's sort of that's a mistake

1011
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,980
that the Russians made with cyber in

1012
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,180
Ukraine

1013
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,060
so you know takeaways here Espionage is

1014
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:27,420
valuable info is critical affects the

1015
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,280
like contextually they can be useful

1016
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,780
they can they can work with supplements

1017
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,000
they can be enablers there's a lot of

1018
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,700
ways that effects can be useful but in

1019
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,520
and of themselves they're not really you

1020
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,160
know uh as we said earlier cyber attacks

1021
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,280
are not attacks like they're not that

1022
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,200
important

1023
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:46,800
um

1024
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,040
they seem like the sort of thing that

1025
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,320
you'd want to do right like they get all

1026
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,020
of the uh excitement but the reality is

1027
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,880
like you just need oil changes like you

1028
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,740
need Espionage

1029
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,960
um that's how you win it's not through

1030
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,640
having something that seems cool

1031
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,500
and that sort of brings us into like

1032
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,220
where do these civilian volunteers fit

1033
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,420
into

1034
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,480
cyber operations and well they're not

1035
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,920
very good for Espionage right like

1036
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,740
you've got people who are not integrated

1037
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,160
into the command hierarchy who have made

1038
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,720
up completely volunteers which means

1039
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,520
that they're going to include members of

1040
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,280
the opposition uh the enemy

1041
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,180
um

1042
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:34,079
you cannot tell them like

1043
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,220
what to get and you know you can't make

1044
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,500
it so that they collect on things that

1045
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,940
you actually need to know about because

1046
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,099
that's a security risk

1047
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:47,640
you cannot control where they go where

1048
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,200
they don't go

1049
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,480
um because all of this stuff reveals

1050
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,280
sensitive information about your own

1051
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,859
actual operations that they have no

1052
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:57,839
business knowing and that you do not

1053
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,359
want to broadcast to the opposition

1054
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:03,780
so you can't control them you can't

1055
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:07,440
trust any of the data that they get you

1056
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,900
can't tell them what to do because you

1057
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,660
you know like they're civilians that you

1058
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,040
know not only do they not necessarily

1059
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,220
take Direction but any direction you

1060
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,920
give them is basically public so you may

1061
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,380
as well just print out publicly what you

1062
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,480
want to know and see if they do it from

1063
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,619
there and that's also not great

1064
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:29,579
um

1065
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:31,560
and you cannot trust anything that comes

1066
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,040
from them like they are as likely to be

1067
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,920
the enemy as to be trying to help you so

1068
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,079
anything that you do collect is

1069
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,380
potentially uh tainted uh messed with

1070
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,359
contaminated maybe even infected with

1071
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,960
malware you know it is not really a

1072
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,319
useful Espionage capability having just

1073
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,599
random civilians

1074
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:57,000
um going out and operating in cyber it's

1075
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,740
not to say that there aren't ways that

1076
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,480
they can help there are certainly

1077
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,780
channels uh that this can be useful but

1078
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:07,260
it's more tactical than strategic it's

1079
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,660
uh sort of very much the you know where

1080
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,780
are the tanks now like that's useful uh

1081
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,980
what is the location of a um you know a

1082
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,980
bunker or a um Barracks or something

1083
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,960
like that these specific sorts of

1084
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,240
information are useful and they can be

1085
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,400
used and verified and then um you know

1086
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,040
if they're false it's not a big deal but

1087
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,500
for example if you were to steal like a

1088
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,200
male spool that's different

1089
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,460
um

1090
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,140
okay

1091
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,260
why does this matter well because

1092
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,359
it means that effects operations are

1093
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:44,819
basically the only thing that civilians

1094
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:46,740
can do like the only defensive cyber

1095
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,240
that's left them is effect operations

1096
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,900
because they cannot do Espionage at a

1097
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,240
level that's actually useful and unless

1098
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,619
they're on the ground they can't do the

1099
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:58,680
Tactical Espionage so the only thing

1100
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,020
that sort of really left is

1101
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,819
around with stuff in a way that's going

1102
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:05,160
to cause problems

1103
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,900
is there a solution

1104
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,599
um yes there is so

1105
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,579
the solution I propose is information

1106
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:15,180
sharing and uh public private

1107
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,598
Partnerships

1108
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,460
um essentially

1109
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:23,280
like these are jokes but the the way

1110
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,380
that I think it could possibly work is

1111
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,500
if the civilian groups make the

1112
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,480
information that

1113
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,200
they have including their targeting and

1114
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,079
um their planning and sort of their

1115
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:39,180
collection their take if they make that

1116
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:42,300
information available in a channel that

1117
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,720
can be collected and analyzed by state

1118
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,300
authorities

1119
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,099
then you know there might be some gold

1120
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,920
that shows up in that stream like that

1121
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,359
could be useful

1122
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:56,339
uh similarly that information could be

1123
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:59,460
useful in informing sort of where not to

1124
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,140
go because it's going to be ddosed for a

1125
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,640
while

1126
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,520
um that's basically the the partnership

1127
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,359
as well that I'm I'm thinking about so

1128
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,920
we're coming to the end and I'm only a

1129
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,180
little bit over so this is great news

1130
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,220
final thoughts so

1131
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,560
very very rapid this is one of those I

1132
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,640
was told that you have to like tell

1133
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,660
people what you're going to tell them

1134
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,460
tell them and then tell them what you

1135
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,500
told them so

1136
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,119
this is what I told you strategic

1137
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,400
operational tactical Espionage info and

1138
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,839
effects

1139
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:33,300
um and also you know

1140
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,060
basically having a capability that

1141
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,099
exists in isolation is useless if you

1142
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:40,619
have the ability to cause effects but

1143
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:43,800
it's not under your control and it

1144
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,980
happens independently of what you are

1145
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,460
trying to actually do strategically it's

1146
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,980
worse than useless so

1147
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,940
um

1148
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,160
you know you don't want civilians

1149
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,380
 around in your War

1150
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,160
um like civilian volunteers like this is

1151
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,319
um this is something for the guys doing

1152
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,180
the talent manual I'm sure they're going

1153
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,680
to be very excited to write about it

1154
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,920
it's a legal problem for someone else to

1155
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,359
deal with

1156
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:13,440
um

1157
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,700
practically a way to organize these

1158
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,140
sympathizers in a way that's actually

1159
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,079
productive that's a challenge I don't

1160
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,780
have an answer I I don't know how you do

1161
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,780
it I do know that having them do

1162
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,720
defacements and DDOS and you know other

1163
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,180
random hacks that is not what you want

1164
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:36,618
um that is not helpful

1165
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,980
so those are the lessons we've learned

1166
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:41,760
um

1167
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,800
civilians must not conduct cyber

1168
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,660
operations without integration into the

1169
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,980
Strategic command hierarchy

1170
00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:51,359
uh basically

1171
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,819
cyber should be left to state or state

1172
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:57,000
Affiliated actors because the stuff

1173
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,339
that's being done like it's not a game

1174
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:02,400
it needs to be integrated and in order

1175
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,619
to be exploited it has to be controlled

1176
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:06,839
and understood and

1177
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:08,579
um you know integrated into the entire

1178
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,859
system that's you know fighting the war

1179
00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:13,740
like just showing up and doing stuff on

1180
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,680
your own is not really helping

1181
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,500
um like these uncoordinated independent

1182
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,660
out of nowhere operations they don't

1183
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:25,140
really help and they cause more problems

1184
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,099
than not

1185
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:31,339
so if you want to donate to like the war

1186
00:49:31,339 --> 00:49:35,160
donate donate to charity don't donate to

1187
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,099
bandwidth to DDOS

1188
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:40,980
so you know like where do the civilians

1189
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:41,819
go

1190
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:44,160
 somewhere else like I don't get

1191
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,680
like don't come here it's a war go away

1192
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,099
all right

1193
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:52,980
that's it thank you

1194
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:56,220
uh we now have negative five minutes for

1195
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,459
questions

1196
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:03,599
uh so uh thank you and we have now time

1197
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,900
for uh questions and as I we earlier

1198
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,000
there is already one hand is uh up there

1199
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,700
can the microphone run to the second

1200
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,660
third row

1201
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,180
yeah there is a bit of a struggle to get

1202
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,339
the microphone to the Oscar thank you

1203
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:25,619
very much for the talk uh my question is

1204
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:28,560
how much did you mitigate information

1205
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,960
operations when preparing for this talk

1206
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,060
so how do you research something where

1207
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,940
all parties have incentive to muddle the

1208
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,900
truth shall we say

1209
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,359
um yeah like

1210
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:46,020
well there's a lot of echo okay so the

1211
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,599
information operation stuff is very very

1212
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:49,559
public

1213
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:53,339
um typically in terms of the uh actual

1214
00:50:53,339 --> 00:50:56,099
stuff going on like I I clearly like

1215
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:58,079
obviously I don't have any uh privileged

1216
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,059
information about Espionage operations

1217
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:03,300
or whatever uh what I do have is uh

1218
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,960
access to people who um like either work

1219
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,339
in assistant organizations or people who

1220
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:14,000
are familiar with what's going on and

1221
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,980
like they've passed to me things about

1222
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,380
like what is

1223
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,780
um what is the difficulty that they

1224
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,420
faced because of uh like the I.T cyber

1225
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,500
Army

1226
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,339
um in terms of like how things are done

1227
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:32,099
during war like um that's a thing I've

1228
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:33,900
been researching so I can generically

1229
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,760
state that like Espionage is a good

1230
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,859
thing that you want to do

1231
00:51:37,859 --> 00:51:39,780
um in terms of like the information

1232
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,700
operations that happen

1233
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,819
um like we can see like again like

1234
00:51:44,819 --> 00:51:46,079
that's a thing that I've been involved

1235
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,780
with is looking at um

1236
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,540
Russian information operations starting

1237
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,839
a little bit before 2016

1238
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:57,240
um and again like it's a thing that we

1239
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,680
have visibility on like we can see

1240
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:03,000
what's going on so it's like it's not as

1241
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,559
difficult

1242
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:05,339
um

1243
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:06,720
like it depends on what you're trying to

1244
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,700
do but like for the the purposes I have

1245
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,460
it's not that difficult I just need to

1246
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,319
know generally speaking what are the

1247
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:15,660
things they do why are they doing it and

1248
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:18,480
um sort of what is the result like and

1249
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,240
that's sort of that's fairly easy to get

1250
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,040
okay we have a next question I think

1251
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,900
thank you

1252
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,780
hello uh firstly I want to thank you

1253
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,720
about your presentation in your talk uh

1254
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,940
I would like to come back on your

1255
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:39,480
um the the thing you said about Cyber

1256
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,099
attack are not attack because nobody

1257
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:45,660
dies what do you think about people uh

1258
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,540
dying about cyber attacking Hospital

1259
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:52,920
like in Germany if I remember well

1260
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,780
yeah so

1261
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,559
um

1262
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:59,160
it's a like it's a generalization that

1263
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,619
is useful to think about not that

1264
00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:03,059
they're not that there are not

1265
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:05,400
exceptions but

1266
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,859
um typically things to things to

1267
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:10,440
understand about attacks are uh sort of

1268
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,720
like the psychological impact that they

1269
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,500
have

1270
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,940
so

1271
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,800
um ways of thinking about this for

1272
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,280
example are uh like carpet bombing uh

1273
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,859
the idea with doing strategic carpet

1274
00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:27,119
bombing of uh an enemy nation is that

1275
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,980
you are going to beat the population

1276
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,599
into submission

1277
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:32,520
that uh you know dropping all these

1278
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,980
bombs will make them give up hope and

1279
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,140
lose support and

1280
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,400
the reality is that the actual

1281
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,960
psychological impact of the attack is to

1282
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,740
make people draw tighter together and to

1283
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:50,339
resist harder so that sort of intended

1284
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:53,280
effect of the attacks doesn't happen it

1285
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,220
actually has the opposite effect

1286
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:58,619
cyber also has psychological effects

1287
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:02,579
which are uh counter-intuitive in a way

1288
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:05,640
so if you attack a nation

1289
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,700
you are likely to make them draw closer

1290
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,319
together whereas if you attack an

1291
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:11,579
individual

1292
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:14,160
you sort of get this

1293
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,780
um victim blaming thing that happens

1294
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:19,020
like in the industry we know like we've

1295
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,220
been sort of training ourselves and

1296
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,339
we're trained not to blame the victim

1297
00:54:22,339 --> 00:54:25,559
but the public doesn't have that

1298
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:26,300
um

1299
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:30,960
they like they're not going to look at a

1300
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,660
Cyber attack against something

1301
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,480
um as

1302
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,940
equivalent to a kinetic attack against

1303
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:41,460
the same Target if you blew up a

1304
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,339
hospital and it only killed one person

1305
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:47,520
that would still be a significant attack

1306
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,079
that would have a lot of psychological

1307
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:51,839
response that would sort of require a

1308
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:54,359
political response of some sort

1309
00:54:54,359 --> 00:54:57,180
if you do a Cyber attack that kills one

1310
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,200
person

1311
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,480
you for example could not use that as

1312
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,880
justification to invade a country like

1313
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,460
you would not have public support at the

1314
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,140
same level because

1315
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,880
people will be going like why do why

1316
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,619
does like my brother have to go and die

1317
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:12,420
because someone couldn't install some

1318
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,740
 patches

1319
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:18,059
right like that I I do not want my um my

1320
00:55:18,059 --> 00:55:19,740
sons being sent off to die because

1321
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,240
someone didn't have budget for a

1322
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,200
firewall

1323
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:27,000
so in uh like in that sense as a tax

1324
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,119
like they're not really attacks

1325
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:32,880
um but similarly like doing DDOS against

1326
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,160
Russia like it doesn't attack Russia it

1327
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,520
doesn't do anything that actually helps

1328
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,740
the war in any way like if attacking

1329
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,540
Russia in some kinetic fashion would

1330
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,339
help you know like it doesn't do

1331
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:45,960
anything it's inconsequential and it's

1332
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,720
meaningless in terms of the war itself

1333
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,119
um except in how it changes the

1334
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:53,339
environment and adjusts the security

1335
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:57,839
posture of uh people who you know

1336
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:59,400
ideally you'd want to have a very weak

1337
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,200
security posture so that they would be

1338
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,380
easy pickings for uh the Ukrainian

1339
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:10,440
forces so yes like a Cyber attack could

1340
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,960
kill someone but

1341
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,180
you know like that's uh like I think

1342
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,339
that's quibbling about

1343
00:56:17,339 --> 00:56:19,920
um specifics when the the point is more

1344
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,559
about like they don't have the impact of

1345
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:23,880
an attack and they don't have the

1346
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,760
utility of an attack and they're not

1347
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,440
reproducible in the same way

1348
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,140
um they're not sort of like instant

1349
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,540
um like there's a lot about them that

1350
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:36,420
are just not very useful in the same way

1351
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,339
that a bomb is useful but they're far

1352
00:56:38,339 --> 00:56:41,280
more useful in a lot of other ways so

1353
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,859
anyway I don't know if that answers your

1354
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:45,900
question but that explains a little bit

1355
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,220
more of my thinking about it I hope

1356
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,800
thank you very answer that's really

1357
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,280
appreciate

1358
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,380
back there

1359
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,839
okay we will take one one question and

1360
00:56:57,839 --> 00:56:59,460
after this question there is a question

1361
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,800
for the crook which of the three three

1362
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,500
questions uh is the winning question but

1363
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,720
the question first the winning question

1364
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,520
is whoever offers to share

1365
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:15,680
the correct question

1366
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,940
hi thank you very much very much

1367
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,520
appreciated the talk the one area that

1368
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,619
I've become greatly concerned with is

1369
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:25,680
the bgp rerouting and so it's been

1370
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,839
publicized in the last few months that

1371
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,940
Ukrainian operators has been forced

1372
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:33,599
right to provide their Transit through a

1373
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,700
Russian operators so of course you know

1374
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,700
Russia now has all the intelligence for

1375
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,980
all of the traffic that's been rerouted

1376
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,480
to them

1377
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,940
um I believe that Ukraine is starting to

1378
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:47,760
use more of starlink right and so one of

1379
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,619
the questions that I have for you while

1380
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:51,900
in the beginning months ago the Call to

1381
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,859
Arms for civilians might have seemed

1382
00:57:54,859 --> 00:57:58,020
unstructured right it might be that

1383
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,359
there's actually strategic objectives

1384
00:58:00,359 --> 00:58:04,020
both on either side but they they really

1385
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:06,839
need more manpower that once they then

1386
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:08,940
have gathered the intelligence and then

1387
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,160
maybe have targets and operational

1388
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,160
aspects that they will then use these

1389
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,800
volunteers to carry carry that out so do

1390
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,319
you see from your experience that

1391
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:23,300
there's more structure or or not

1392
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,180
um yeah and I I can see how that's

1393
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,380
appealing

1394
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,040
um

1395
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:33,300
but as far as I know

1396
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,579
um that is not the case

1397
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:37,980
there is like

1398
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:42,359
it's important to realize how State

1399
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:45,420
organizations actually work so the

1400
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,040
intelligence services are like the

1401
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,780
intelligence Services they're cool they

1402
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:50,160
do Espionage they do Intel they do

1403
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,480
counter Intel like all this stuff

1404
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,760
they're civil servants

1405
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,280
right like that there are bureaucracy

1406
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,940
that collects information they do not

1407
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,640
really integrate well with just

1408
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,020
volunteers

1409
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,240
right it integrates well if they recruit

1410
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,099
people you know like they if you become

1411
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:10,260
an asset for them that's the thing they

1412
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:11,940
know how to do like that is a structure

1413
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,799
that they have and you can fit into the

1414
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:17,099
system that they have for managing

1415
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:19,260
um external people if you show up as a

1416
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,180
volunteer they do not have a way of

1417
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,920
processing that that's not a thing that

1418
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,480
they do

1419
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,880
um it is like and they don't change

1420
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,339
quickly either right like if if you want

1421
00:59:29,339 --> 00:59:32,040
like rapid change doing something in

1422
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,500
four or five years is considered pretty

1423
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,660
cool you know like that's that's a

1424
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,640
speedy flexible organization

1425
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,579
um so in the time frames that we're

1426
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:43,740
looking at like that's not a thing that

1427
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,119
can actually

1428
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,059
um like I would be very very surprised

1429
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:51,000
if the intelligent Services were able to

1430
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,540
create a way for civilian volunteers to

1431
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:57,000
assist meaningfully in cyber operations

1432
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,280
in the last six months

1433
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,140
um like that would Shock Me

1434
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,599
I I don't think that that's a thing

1435
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,480
they're going to do because as far as I

1436
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,819
know there would be more interested in

1437
01:00:08,819 --> 01:00:12,180
expanding their own capability

1438
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:13,619
um which another way of thinking about

1439
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:15,780
it is they want more budget and more

1440
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,640
head count right like they're gonna

1441
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,500
they're gonna look at it and someone's

1442
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,119
gonna say all right

1443
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,940
um we need more cyber now if you are the

1444
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,380
head of the Cyber Department the correct

1445
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:27,480
response is great I need more money and

1446
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,700
I need to hire more people because then

1447
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,280
I can give you more cyber the incorrect

1448
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,200
response is awesome let's just put

1449
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,760
something on Telegram and see who shows

1450
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,799
up all right like that that's not how

1451
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:39,660
you get promotions um that's not how you

1452
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,579
advance your career like that's just

1453
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:43,980
like that's not the way that uh State

1454
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:47,160
organizations work generally speaking

1455
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:47,880
um

1456
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,440
so

1457
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,599
like that there was this panicked call

1458
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,819
that went out and it went out from uh

1459
01:00:53,819 --> 01:00:54,960
the

1460
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,700
what's it like the the developing

1461
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,040
technology guy

1462
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,839
whatever like he's not part of the

1463
01:01:00,839 --> 01:01:02,880
security services right like he's The

1464
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,180
Tech Guy and it's cool and like

1465
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:09,540
um they do good stuff but they are not

1466
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,040
part of the intelligence services or

1467
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,900
part of the military in terms of being

1468
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,940
integrated within what's happening in

1469
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,440
cyber so

1470
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,900
uh he was sort of operating on his own

1471
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,619
on that one and if you look at the um

1472
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:25,680
messaging that's happened sort of since

1473
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,540
I think they got a lot of pushback

1474
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:31,020
internally because you can see that the

1475
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,299
um like the way that they talk about

1476
01:01:33,299 --> 01:01:38,640
things is very guarded and it's sort of

1477
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,260
a little bit open to interpretation so

1478
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:42,359
if you're being generous you could go oh

1479
01:01:42,359 --> 01:01:46,740
okay like these guys like the It Army

1480
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,240
um but if you

1481
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,240
know the backstory of how it's caused

1482
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,160
them problems you can see that they're

1483
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,599
trying to

1484
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:56,700
not say like these guys have us

1485
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,099
over I wish this hadn't happened without

1486
01:01:59,099 --> 01:02:01,740
saying that like so um I think one of

1487
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:04,559
the recent ones was they were like one

1488
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:07,079
of the ministers I think that particular

1489
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:09,240
Minister was asked about

1490
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,640
um like recent uh like DDOS or something

1491
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,980
like that and his response was along the

1492
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,079
lines of you know we're happy with

1493
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:18,720
everyone that comes and assists Ukraine

1494
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,760
in our fight for freedom

1495
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,520
and you know like

1496
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,799
that's sort of how they're doing it like

1497
01:02:25,799 --> 01:02:26,880
they don't really like what's happened

1498
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:32,760
okay okay thank you group uh and uh

1499
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:36,660
uploads from the talent side

1500
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:41,700
thank you thank you and uh but as we

1501
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,220
have some merch for the those who are

1502
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,020
asking uh questions

1503
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:50,099
uh then you had three questions uh which

1504
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:54,599
one of these would you pick

1505
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:56,400
the first one about

1506
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,280
um

1507
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:03,140
about hospital and

1508
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,960
yeah I I

1509
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,099
actually like the third one because I

1510
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:10,980
get to talk about how um civil servants

1511
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,880
to Empire building which I think is it's

1512
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,500
a good way of thinking about Cyprus

1513
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,799
there's two sides to it okay thank you

1514
01:03:19,799 --> 01:03:23,640
and I I think volunteers will help the

1515
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,819
win
