the nhs for a while the app you can see

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,800
in the background there is called open

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,920
eobs

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,079
which is something that we made um an

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,039
open source nursing observation system

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,360
pretty proud of that um

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,600
patient safety and open source not

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,199
normally things that people thought

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,920
would go together but we made one next

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,160
slide please thank you i also did this

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,480
thing uh we were talking earlier about

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,159
smart cards uh which reminded me uh i

25
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,280
made an operating system for the nhs

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,080
oh

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,400
wasn't that hard and put a nice skin on

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,840
ubuntu and that's what we made uh

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,759
made that in response to the wannacry uh

30
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,400
events which i've heard spoken about as

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
well already this afternoon

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,119
um that was good fun and

33
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,479
uh next slide please these days i'm

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,520
chief platform engineer at camp gemini

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,640
and

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,880
when i'm not hacking at work i'm hacking

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,759
at home as a bit of an amateur health

38
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,560
apps researcher

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,840
something there in the background i've

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,280
found some open firebase urls

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,799
we've all done it haven't we we've all

42
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,840
left it open but

43
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,960
i found those by accident reported those

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,200
and that report went extremely well but

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,280
i'm here today to talk to you about some

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,079
broken cyber law about how what happens

47
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,479
when it goes extremely

48
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,680
badly

49
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,038
let's move on one thank you

50
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,080
so

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,319
and another one so

52
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,480
how it started i'm going to tell you a

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,200
little story next slide please about

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,640
what happened when i discovered some

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,080
public code on github

56
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,319
that had

57
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,080
all the bad things that you shouldn't

58
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,200
put on the internet on the internet

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,160
uh

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,840
i found this quite by accident i was i

61
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,440
wasn't using a particular tool uh wasn't

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,000
doing those mass scanning where people

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,360
search for

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,280
um

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,080
api keys or um or buckets or anything i

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,440
found it quite by accident

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,560
first of all i didn't actually

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,519
really believe that what i found was um

69
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,480
was real about verifying um what i'd

70
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,920
found

71
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,159
uh i managed to identify the owner of

72
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,000
the repository um

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,800
and uh managed to verify the

74
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
authenticity of some of the contents of

75
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,599
that

76
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,360
next slide please

77
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,280
and

78
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,599
after doing all this

79
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,680
this investigation i was able to

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,760
ascertain that an organization set up by

81
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,519
nhs england

82
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,480
uh

83
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,200
to support open source and open

84
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,400
standards in the nhs in healthcare had

85
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,319
accidentally leaked

86
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,440
all of their secrets um in

87
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,480
uh

88
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,680
for their

89
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,879
for one of their line of business

90
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,319
applications

91
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,560
straight on github

92
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,480
next slide

93
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,519
so

94
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,159
this was obviously

95
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,360
uh

96
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,040
this is obviously

97
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,959
a bad thing

98
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,000
um

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,239
and because i knew the organization i

100
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,560
thought i would write this up as a

101
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,239
disclosure

102
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,360
help them out

103
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,560
write it up

104
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,760
uh with information about the repos

105
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,080
um the aware

106
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,760
where the secrets were hidden in the

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,720
code

108
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,680
um

109
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,320
i also did some

110
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,160
investigation into the framework they

111
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,440
were using

112
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,720
uh which

113
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,000
had some

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,680
as you can see there's some sqli and

115
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,960
some rce vulnerabilities uh

116
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,479
there

117
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,400
and i thought i'd written up a really

118
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,280
nice uh report and uh send it over to

119
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,880
them there's a little example of it

120
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,840
there

121
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,720
um not the real one i'll get in a lot of

122
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,840
trouble if i post the real report on the

123
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,720
internet uh

124
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
next slide please

125
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,880
so

126
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,040
i thought just sending this over would

127
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,840
be

128
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,720
simple um

129
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
send them the report

130
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,639
they said thank you

131
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,720
they took the broken application off the

132
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,479
internet and they took the code repost

133
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,440
private

134
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,880
brilliant

135
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,560
uh obviously if you've had your

136
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,639
usernames and passwords and api keys on

137
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,880
the internet for two years uh you can

138
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,840
consider that they are compromised

139
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,880
uh

140
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,280
a little bit taking them down from the

141
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,840
internet it's a little bit like closing

142
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,520
the stable door

143
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,600
after the horses bolted

144
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,759
uh but it was um

145
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,240
it was good to see how swiftly they

146
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,199
responded to um the report coming into

147
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,919
their um

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,400
to their info address um

149
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,198
next slide please thank you so

150
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,919
and i thought nothing of it

151
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,720
until about a week later

152
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,479
i receive this

153
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,039
in my mail

154
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,479
uh

155
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,160
the correspondence from aperture's

156
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,360
lawyers tol um said that i had committed

157
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,840
various offenses under the computer

158
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,759
misuse act 1980 1990

159
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,199
possibly committed offences on um for

160
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,520
stealing intellectual property

161
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,960
may have committed offences under the

162
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,160
database regulations that exist um

163
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,039
because of brexit and they demanded some

164
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,199
undertakings

165
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,440
uh

166
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,880
which was a bit of a surprise because i

167
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,120
wasn't really expecting this after

168
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,360
being thanked by the organization for

169
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
helping them out with this one

170
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,160
uh next slide please

171
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,520
so i wrote a bit of a full some response

172
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,840
initially um

173
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,919
along the lines of

174
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,400
your clients put it on the internet i've

175
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,039
just helped them out a little bit by

176
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,479
telling them that they've done a bad

177
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,639
thing

178
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,759
but i figured that because the lawyers

179
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,840
were quite instead were quite firm in

180
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,960
this correspondence i had to respond

181
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,560
unequivocally

182
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,479
so i gave them some confirmations back

183
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,560
um

184
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,720
it's a normal thing right we do a

185
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,960
disclosure we get letters from lawyers

186
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,720
you'd hope not

187
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,560
um but i gave them those five

188
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,199
undertakings and i thought that's quite

189
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,599
clear

190
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,759
but it turns out that it wasn't quite

191
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,720
clear next slide please

192
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,160
they were not happy

193
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,440
um

194
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,840
the lawyer had latched on to this one

195
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,400
word the word compromised

196
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,720
i mean i'm in a room of of um i'm not in

197
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,319
the room i'm in a room of sec

198
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,080
professionals i mean if i was to say to

199
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,599
you

200
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,199
your usernames and passwords are on

201
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,400
github should that be considered

202
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,240
yes that should be considered

203
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,680
compromised

204
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,240
not that i had compromised it but the

205
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,400
application and the anything around it

206
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,560
anything that uses those api keys should

207
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,080
be considered compromised

208
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,039
next slide

209
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,599
and within an hour of receiving that

210
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,280
email i receive another bit of

211
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,879
correspondence

212
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,919
um that says that i was boasting of my

213
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,520
unlawful extraction of the data and have

214
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,400
threatened to access the systems again

215
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,240
um

216
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,200
this was because i tweeted

217
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,039
that tweet on the previous slide and

218
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,640
then the horse was bolted away it was

219
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,120
getting a little bit preposterous quite

220
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,679
quickly the lawyers were really on um

221
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,279
were really on me with this uh

222
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,519
really coming on hard with this unlawful

223
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,160
activity bit and i was starting to get

224
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,600
quite worried at this point

225
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,680
next slide please

226
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,760
input because it's because there's this

227
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,160
last bit here

228
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,320
please advise how we may serve your

229
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,000
solicitor

230
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,320
so i'm getting worried now i don't fancy

231
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,040
having an injunction served on me i

232
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,399
don't fancy

233
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,279
uh

234
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,959
being um taken to court for

235
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,760
helping someone out so

236
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
i figured that i could no longer bluster

237
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,480
through this by googling how to respond

238
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,240
to lawyers letters

239
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,279
and

240
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,560
i had to ask for some help

241
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,199
next slide

242
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,640
so i did um

243
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,320
i reached out to

244
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,519
on infosec twitter

245
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,200
and asked for help

246
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,200
i said i need to find a cyber savvy

247
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,040
lawyer

248
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,839
that can help me

249
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,160
um respond to this

250
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,640
because i don't know what i'm doing

251
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,440
uh

252
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,480
thankfully infosec twitter family is

253
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,720
awesome and friendly and

254
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,399
welcoming to

255
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,600
newbies like me and

256
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,800
were

257
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,360
overnight i'd been put in touch with

258
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,240
three

259
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,000
competent cyber experienced lawyers

260
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,959
including someone who works for um

261
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,000
google uh doing their

262
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,920
representations um eff got in touch they

263
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
helped out um and pointed me in the

264
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,360
right direction

265
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,800
um

266
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,959
some of you may be aware of open rights

267
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,640
group

268
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,120
and the noto id campaigns in the uk they

269
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,959
got involved they helped me out quite

270
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,160
extensively

271
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,920
um but

272
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,079
this thing these things these things had

273
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,600
a cost

274
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
and

275
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,279
when i received the estimate from the

276
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,120
lawyers i knew that i wasn't going to be

277
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,240
able to support this entirely myself so

278
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,360
i did throw up a gofundme for

279
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,079
initially a few thousand pounds because

280
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,800
i thought one letter by reply

281
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,440
and they'll go away

282
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,680
uh

283
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,240
yeah that's that's not what happened in

284
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,800
the end so we'll carry on uh next slide

285
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,800
please

286
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,360
the letters from the lawyers kept on

287
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,920
coming to my solicitors that i had

288
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,680
appointed um

289
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,680
i was being asked

290
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,920
for undertakings initially that they

291
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,399
would that they had received

292
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,399
then they wanted a statement of truth

293
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,880
um which my lawyer had no idea what it

294
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,519
was um but uh

295
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,440
we offered um again the undertakings

296
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,040
that have been given

297
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,380
uh

298
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,040
[Music]

299
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,880
and they gave me one final chance to do

300
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,279
it all of this high-stakes language all

301
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,160
the time um if you if you aren't doing

302
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,240
it then we're going to take legal action

303
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,680
and it's going to get very bad for you

304
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,360
very quickly

305
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,079
next slide please

306
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,079
so after a couple of days

307
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,040
we

308
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,880
with my solicitors this is just a first

309
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,440
statement um but the confirmation of

310
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,760
facts that i produced with my solicitors

311
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,360
ran to

312
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,680
something like 11 pages

313
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,560
of

314
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,600
clearly

315
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,120
stepping through

316
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,959
what i had found

317
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,680
how um what i had done with it when i

318
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,880
found it

319
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,959
uh

320
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,839
who i had advised about it or

321
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,839
all of these um all of these sorts of

322
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:32,959
things

323
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,120
and then it started to get even sillier

324
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,680
as you can see here

325
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,399
they were asking me to destroy documents

326
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,320
that i produced or

327
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,440
things that

328
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,040
which i thought was a bit preposterous

329
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,360
because i had done some work with them

330
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,160
on open source projects in the past and

331
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,519
now i'm getting

332
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,279
pressure to delete materials that i

333
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,360
have been told that aperta have revoked

334
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,160
my open source license to use them

335
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,279
uh

336
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,399
but it was it was

337
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,160
getting deeply technical and deeply into

338
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,839
these um

339
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,839
uh definitions all the time despite and

340
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,959
every time we offered a confirmation

341
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,160
they wanted something new confirmed

342
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,040
next slide please

343
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,600
and then it went quiet

344
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,279
for a few days

345
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,480
and then i received an email from a

346
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,360
detective constable specialist cyber

347
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,320
investigator at northumberland police

348
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,839
it appeared that aperta had reported my

349
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,920
disclosure to them as a cyber crime

350
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,639
and was about to be investigated for um

351
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,880
whether or not i had

352
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,360
um committed an offense under the

353
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,440
computer misuse act

354
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,079
i'll go into some detail a little bit

355
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,320
later on as to what possible offences i

356
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,760
could have

357
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,199
but yeah um

358
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,440
i elected to not speak to the

359
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,760
police see i asked my solicitors to have

360
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,959
the conversation first and for a couple

361
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,720
of weeks the

362
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,120
lawyers and the police officer went back

363
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,279
and forth

364
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,600
and before confirming that there was no

365
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,120
case to answer

366
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,880
and this was

367
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,839
a civil matter that had been referred to

368
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,560
the police seemingly for

369
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,600
um

370
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
vexatious or

371
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,800
malicious purposes

372
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,360
thank goodness um

373
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,760
because you don't really want to do a

374
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,320
good samaritan thing and end up with a

375
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,199
criminal record

376
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,160
next slide please

377
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,320
this got written up quite extensively

378
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,040
this uh this experience that i was

379
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,760
having and i thought i'd um

380
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,480
paste some of the links to the articles

381
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,040
here for people to look at later

382
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,800
because

383
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,519
this um this whole

384
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,800
incident

385
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,199
um

386
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,079
began to shine a light on the problems

387
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,560
that independent security researchers

388
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,440
face

389
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,480
um

390
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,000
when working in the uk

391
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,920
and it coincided with the 30-year

392
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,399
anniversary of the computer misuse act

393
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,600
uh that's right we have legislation for

394
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,320
cyber crime on the statute book that's

395
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,639
older than google

396
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,800
at 23 years

397
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,120
so um

398
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,560
with the

399
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,440
computer misuse act um

400
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,680
being considered not fit for purpose

401
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,240
there was a campaign going on um they

402
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,759
got picked up by

403
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,880
um these orgs and um

404
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,519
and written about

405
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,600
the best thing to watch if you have time

406
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,279
i can't show this for reasons that will

407
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,440
become clear but the best thing to watch

408
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,440
is the video

409
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,040
because the video um

410
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
put some

411
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,000
third-party verification on my claims i

412
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,160
had claimed that these that there was a

413
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,519
repo with information on the internet

414
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,440
and um

415
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,600
sick codes and the sakura samurai people

416
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,639
found the repository

417
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,279
in the internet archive way back machine

418
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,320
downloaded it and verified the contents

419
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,639
um

420
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,759
yeah

421
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,120
thank goodness for that because i was

422
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,199
beginning to feel that i was not being

423
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,320
believed

424
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,279
next slide please

425
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,240
which is just an overflow of my css boo

426
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,599
uh can i have the next next slide please

427
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,720
thank you

428
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,439
so as i said um i can't really talk too

429
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,679
much about the deep

430
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,839
contents of the repository because

431
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,439
after the police

432
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,599
had closed their um investigation

433
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,599
a perta

434
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,599
came forward with

435
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,840
some documents that indicated they were

436
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,039
going to take me to the high court

437
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,240
and

438
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,880
secure an injunction that would prevent

439
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,600
me

440
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,799
from

441
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,200
disclosing what i had found

442
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,840
this you remember being the materials

443
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,120
i've already said i won't disclose that

444
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,160
i've already said i have deleted

445
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,559
and

446
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,799
yeah it was preposterous really but

447
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,280
to receive the threat of a high court

448
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,440
injunction and to have

449
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,760
the

450
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,880
looming costs of nearly

451
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,640
60 or 70 000 pounds

452
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,039
to turn up to court and defend myself

453
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,360
i couldn't

454
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,000
i couldn't stomach that

455
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,799
so i entered into an undertaking with

456
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,000
aperta in lieu of going to

457
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,960
the high court and i am not allowed to

458
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,160
talk about

459
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
what i obtained

460
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,240
not that i obtained anything but uh i'm

461
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,919
not allowed to talk about it

462
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,200
so do watch the video because it's

463
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,000
hilarious

464
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,320
uh next slide please

465
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,000
so i wanted to

466
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,840
now maybe talk a little bit about why

467
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,679
that is so

468
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,600
awful how can it be that i can go from

469
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,880
doing

470
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,039
a good faith public samaritan act

471
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,799
hey friend you've left your passwords on

472
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,400
display on the internet you might want

473
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,640
to change that and how to get how you

474
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,840
get from that through

475
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,000
to huge expense and potentially even

476
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,520
more and

477
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,000
fear of a criminal record

478
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,400
next slide

479
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
because when the when cyber law in the

480
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,200
uk goes wrong

481
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,480
uh

482
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,080
these are the sorts of things that can

483
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,360
happen

484
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,640
there was there was over 500 emails back

485
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,000
and forth between my lawyer and their

486
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,919
lawyer always clarifying points and

487
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,480
every one of those has a cost right

488
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,799
lawyers don't work for free they don't

489
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,240
work on open source projects for a

490
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,559
reason

491
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,799
no matter how many times i gave an

492
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,960
undertaking it didn't seem to get right

493
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,400
so this is probably one of those

494
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,760
debugging sort of things maybe it was a

495
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
laura's code problem but

496
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,200
trying to get a satisfactory undertaking

497
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,480
agreed took a long time thus ever

498
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,240
increasing the costs 25000 the uk was

499
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,320
um

500
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,039
is where i've got to in these costs

501
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,440
thanks to the awesomeness of infosec

502
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,480
twitter

503
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,280
uh about 15 000 pounds of that has been

504
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,799
covered including uh very early on in

505
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,600
the

506
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,280
whole experience

507
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,280
a sizable contribution from um

508
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
a well-known corporate

509
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,760
uh that seemingly don't like it when

510
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,919
security researchers who are trying to

511
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,039
improve the security of the github

512
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,280
community um they don't like it when

513
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,280
they get picked on so

514
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,120
so know that know that github has got

515
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,360
your back kids

516
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,799
when it comes to these sorts of things

517
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,200
on the plus side i did make a lot of new

518
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,320
friends

519
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,760
uh and i've spoken with a lot of people

520
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,400
about um

521
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,240
how cyber law um could be improved in

522
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,559
the uk

523
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,720
so making some friends was great getting

524
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,000
the legal support was brilliant um but

525
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,440
having to have a couple of weeks off

526
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,840
sick with stress i mean i couldn't focus

527
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,200
on my work

528
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,320
um

529
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,360
couldn't focus on a lot of things

530
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,799
because it was

531
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,919
seriously

532
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,440
some stressful time particularly when it

533
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,720
looked like i was heading to the high

534
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,039
court

535
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,600
177 pages of materials were prepared by

536
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,760
aperta to um

537
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,360
for their injunction

538
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
it seems that they printed out every

539
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,000
tweet i've ever sent and all of every

540
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,840
github repo

541
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,159
that i've ever made but um they were

542
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,440
serious

543
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,559
127 pages of legal

544
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,840
document

545
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,799
does not get made for free

546
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,440
so if my costs were 25 000

547
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,200
i'd hate to think what their costs were

548
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,520
thank you um

549
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,559
next slide please

550
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,320
so if that if that's the sort of

551
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,159
pressure that you can be under

552
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,320
when it goes bad and the sort of costs

553
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
you can be up again

554
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,600
um

555
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,360
let's have a few minutes now to talk

556
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,919
about what needs fixing and how we might

557
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,320
go about in cyber law next slide

558
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,240
so as i said the computer misuse act is

559
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,159
30 years old

560
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,679
it's um

561
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,360
it's quite it is

562
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,559
not really fit for internet age

563
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,559
uh there has been a campaign in the uk

564
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,080
led by

565
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,840
um

566
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,039
an industry alliance including tech uk

567
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,799
um ncc group rapid7 and a couple of

568
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,000
other of um well-known security brands

569
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,400
that have been working lobbying

570
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,880
parliament to

571
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,559
review the act

572
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,320
and

573
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,200
make

574
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,799
in order to

575
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,000
um

576
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,600
make it fit for

577
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,320
make it fit for internet time

578
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,240
next slide

579
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,919
in particular these are the three things

580
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,880
that i think are broken

581
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,159
people who act in good faith um

582
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,880
or people who are acting in the public

583
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,840
interest are not protected by the

584
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,480
computer misuse act

585
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,280
so if you are a cyber researcher

586
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,240
looking into health apps such as the

587
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,600
covid19 app that when that was published

588
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,880
if you had downloaded that apk file and

589
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,000
had a look inside it

590
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,240
you would be falling foul of the

591
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,000
computer misuse act

592
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,559
um for um

593
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,840
unauthorized tampering with a system

594
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,279
he

595
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,799
even though you had no intention of

596
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,039
breaking it or stealing from it or in

597
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,000
any way trying to compromise it um in

598
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,960
the

599
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,679
in the black hatting kind of sense uh

600
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,720
you are not protected

601
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,159
uh

602
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,720
although there has been guidance issued

603
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,600
to

604
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,400
courts and to

605
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,960
the crown prosecution service

606
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,520
around clarifying intent

607
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,679
did you intend to

608
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,200
break in to steal something or were you

609
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,600
trying to be a helpful kid

610
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,440
that's not on the statue book there is

611
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,159
no obligation for public interest or

612
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,320
good faith um considerations to be made

613
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,640
so this is a bad thing if you are doing

614
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,400
cyber research

615
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,960
either as an independent or indeed as a

616
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,080
corporate in the uk

617
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,080
it can also be weaponized to intimidate

618
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,279
the

619
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,520
complaint made to the police is a good

620
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
example of that

621
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,640
uh

622
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,039
i got off lightly with the police

623
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,159
complaint

624
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,880
there have been other

625
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,799
cases in the united kingdom recently

626
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:13,600
where

627
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,000
a community group

628
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,400
campaigning against a

629
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,320
property developer

630
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,559
and a development of

631
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,120
the local area

632
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,440
the campaigner group found on the

633
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,200
internet

634
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,320
an open google drive with some docs in

635
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,360
it that gave their internal

636
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,440
the property developers internal view of

637
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,960
the project which

638
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
how should we say was somewhat different

639
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,039
from the public view

640
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,360
the campaigners used this document in

641
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,880
order to um strengthen their objections

642
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,440
to the local authorities but the

643
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,960
campaigner

644
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,559
received a visit from the police who

645
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,799
raided his home and confiscated his

646
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,000
machine

647
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,320
because he was um the google drive

648
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,640
um the organization had persuaded the

649
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,240
police that it was a private computer

650
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,159
system and because he did not have

651
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,320
authorization

652
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,320
he had stolen those documents

653
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,520
so

654
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,000
he found these documents by accident

655
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,520
the

656
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,760
the property developer then weaponized

657
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,120
the police to intimidate them and to

658
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,159
um

659
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,480
uh try and silence uh silence the

660
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,400
critics

661
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,760
there have been other examples as well

662
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,000
but that was i think that's a really um

663
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,440
that one plus

664
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,770
myself i think they show how um

665
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:41,039
[Music]

666
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,480
how there is a need for the police to

667
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,799
have better tools at their disposal when

668
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,080
investigating cybercrime

669
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,600
uh it's also financially ruinous so

670
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,480
i spoken about my costs and appertus

671
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,760
costs

672
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,120
um

673
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,960
but let's think about it what that means

674
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,480
on the other side

675
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,600
um

676
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,039
it means that if you've got money you

677
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,279
can win in cyber law

678
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,960
uh another case from earlier this year

679
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,919
um a law firm secured an injunction

680
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,080
against persons unknown

681
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,440
to say that to

682
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,039
prevent them from

683
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,399
uh

684
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,840
publishing data that have been

685
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,640
exfiltrated in a ransomware attack

686
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,919
now

687
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,600
you can only get that sort of justice if

688
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,279
you can afford it and if you've got deep

689
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,039
pockets

690
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,720
in the same way that i was having

691
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,679
problems with um with my own costs it

692
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,240
seems if you've got um an insurance

693
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,960
company or if you have um

694
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,919
um

695
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,799
a really decent um legal fees budget

696
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,840
you can buy whatever law you and

697
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,000
whatever action you want under uk cyber

698
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,159
law

699
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,760
uh next slide please

700
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,760
so that's what's wrong

701
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,919
these are the offences that are

702
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,159
currently listed under the computer

703
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,799
misuse act and these are the um

704
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,640
you can see that these are perhaps not

705
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,080
really

706
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,320
um

707
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,640
internet internet savvy

708
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,480
so causing a computer to perform any

709
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,240
function with the intent to secure

710
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,360
access

711
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,000
um that you're not authorized to

712
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,279
uh

713
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,279
i think we can

714
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,480
understand what that is but also um

715
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,720
these things can also happen by um

716
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,360
by accident uh

717
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,720
you can log in

718
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
and uh to a system and have rights that

719
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,080
you may not know that you're not

720
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,080
supposed to have see there's all of this

721
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,039
um

722
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,320
there are lots of um

723
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,240
sorry i'll yeah

724
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,200
i'll come in again on a bit um this um

725
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,360
causing a computer to perform a function

726
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,320
in um is a challenge for security

727
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,520
researchers because when we use tools

728
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,039
like um

729
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,880
nmap or burp suite or um other scanning

730
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,880
tools uh you are

731
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,960
at risk of

732
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,080
um falling foul of that clause

733
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,039
um because you are interrogating a

734
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,000
system um

735
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,159
with um air without authorization

736
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,360
there is another offense there so if you

737
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,000
commit um

738
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,640
if you're doing something under offense

739
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,760
one which is uh perhaps a reconnaissance

740
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,360
piece then you are using that to commit

741
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,440
further offenses so this is compromising

742
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,960
a system and then

743
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,840
um using it to defraud people

744
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,360
i think i think that's you know that's

745
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,200
that one's probably okay is a bit of

746
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,880
cyber law we can understand that i

747
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,880
compromise the system in order to embed

748
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,600
some malware mage cart

749
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,480
um

750
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,880
yeah those sorts of things uh so comp

751
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,399
i'm committing fraud um after i've

752
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,559
compromised the system

753
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,240
but it's this it's this one here it's

754
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,640
this third one that um is um is really a

755
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,200
problem uh

756
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,840
so it's it's good insofar as it can

757
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,760
cover things like denial of service

758
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,480
attacks or malware and things like that

759
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,200
uh but again it can also cover um

760
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,840
good faith independent um

761
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,039
public interest researchers uh you can

762
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,840
very quickly find yourself

763
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,600
falling foul of

764
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,840
um these three affairs

765
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,600
one of

766
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,039
the third of these offenses as an

767
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,559
independent security researcher

768
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,120
next slide

769
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,919
so

770
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,640
the

771
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,640
knowing that it is broken

772
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,559
um the uk government opened um

773
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,000
an rfc

774
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,840
which was great

775
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,360
um

776
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
i had the opportunity the opportunity to

777
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,679
respond because uh um i figured that my

778
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,080
experiences uh

779
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,080
really should not happen to another

780
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,559
person uh

781
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,799
anything that we could do and i thought

782
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,120
i could do in order to shape the um

783
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,000
an amended computer misuse act to

784
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,880
incorporate protections for cyber

785
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,440
researchers and to

786
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,679
prevent um

787
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,679
the um the criminalization of developers

788
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,440
that make either

789
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,919
um

790
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,279
proof of concepts or release uh tools

791
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,240
for discovery on um on github i thought

792
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,480
that i would respond to those

793
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,840
um

794
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,200
the

795
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,919
actual response and the pool for a

796
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,000
response has now closed and we're

797
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,519
waiting for the government to um publish

798
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,840
the list of responses

799
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,039
in addition to the computer misuse act

800
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,720
uh

801
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,880
next slide please um

802
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,120
in addition to some of the

803
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,159
missing slide in addition to reform of

804
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,720
the computer misuse act uh i think

805
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,640
another thing that needs fixing in

806
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,760
particular

807
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,640
is um the

808
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,840
guidance that the

809
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,480
ncs

810
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,360
ncsc have issued on

811
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,720
um

812
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,240
security

813
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,200
incident response uh instead of it being

814
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,720
guidance for public sector organizations

815
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,519
um i'd like to i think that that needs

816
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,039
to become a mandatory um sort of

817
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,760
operating procedure um

818
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,760
some public sector organizations in the

819
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,519
nhs do ex

820
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,519
in the nhs in particular do extremely

821
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,519
well with their

822
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,200
cyber um cyber response they where they

823
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,279
have public code they have a

824
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:08,880
security.md and they invite both um

825
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,679
public bug bounty program participants

826
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,480
and independent researchers to get in

827
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,039
touch with incidents

828
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,440
um

829
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,799
and because the final site appears to be

830
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,640
missing i don't have my pissy little

831
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,000
quote on the end

832
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,440
which is a bit of an annoyance so um

833
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,880
those are the um

834
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,840
those are the two things um that i was

835
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,039
um

836
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,440
that i wanted to talk about with

837
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,360
what needs fixing

838
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,120
i

839
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,678
thank you for listening
