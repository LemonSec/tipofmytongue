1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,120
it was

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,960
a cold dark day

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,160
in finland

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
year was

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,719
2020.

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,320
i looked at my phone

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,600
and i saw a message or message messages

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,000
from my friends fellow colleagues who

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,600
also work in information security field

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,240
they were saying that there is the

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,000
psychotherapy clinic that has been

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,240
hacked that there is potentially super

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,680
sensitive data that has been breached

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,760
i didn't want to believe it

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,440
this

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,000
scenario of having sensitive patient

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,399
records leaked online

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,760
is something that i had on the top list

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,000
of the things i never want to happen as

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,239
a security professional

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,239
and even before that i used to actually

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,399
study to become a nurse

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,120
and i already had the idea of how

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,000
patient logs look like we i know the

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,760
stuff that gets locked down about

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,760
patients and i didn't even work in

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,400
psychotherapy so i could only imagine

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,640
the things that people go to

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,880
psychotherapist to psychologist to talk

30
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,799
about things that you wouldn't want to

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,040
share with your parents with your loved

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,320
ones

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,720
and now potentially all of that is out

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,280
there online

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,080
it all started on wednesday 21st of

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,439
october

37
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,520
2020.

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,640
i found this message on tor network

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,360
messaging board called tori lauta it's a

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,400
fitness messaging board board on

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,720
tour network that is mostly dedicated

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,720
for selling and buying of drugs and

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,880
other illicit substances

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,439
this was on the random section a person

45
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,000
going by the name of ransom man

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,759
saying that they have hacked

47
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,799
psychotherapy clinic wasdamo.f.i and

48
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,880
they have their hands on sensitive

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,680
patient records and other sensitive data

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,680
such as social security numbers

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,079
addresses and so on

52
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,600
now i didn't want to believe this at

53
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,399
first i would never take criminals word

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,480
for granted so i didn't really

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,560
i thought that this was just a

56
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,879
baseless threat but in either case i

57
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,879
started to look up vastama i wasn't

58
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,440
super familiar with vastama before

59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,280
this incident

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,720
vastamo

61
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,720
based on my googling at the time was a

62
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,560
psychotherapy clinic offering

63
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,040
psychotherapy and psychology services on

64
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,400
public and private sector both

65
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,440
they were quite successful as in they

66
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,480
had raked up revenue of almost 20

67
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,480
million euros only in year 2019.

68
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,160
actually the majority of the company

69
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,360
also had been

70
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,840
sold to inetra partners another company

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,680
in 2019.

72
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,080
the ceo of wastamo called villa tapio

73
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,239
had previously proclaimed how he had

74
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,319
himself programmed and developed the

75
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,760
software as a system that was using

76
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,159
and that was all i really needed to know

77
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,000
at this point

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,959
it didn't take a long time before the

79
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,319
same message

80
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,480
same message that appeared in tori lauda

81
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,959
also appeared on a clear web

82
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:21,920
forum

83
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,400
called uli lauta ulilot is one of the

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,640
top hundred most visited visited

85
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,640
websites in finland so in ulilotta this

86
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,040
post garnered much more attention than

87
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,760
it did originally in tori lauta

88
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,599
and um

89
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,080
in this uh they also state the same

90
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,280
thing as before they state that they

91
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,360
have asked vastamo for 40 bitcoins in

92
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,319
return of not revealing the data that

93
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,360
they have hacked out of their systems

94
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,000
bostomo had stopped answering to ransom

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,799
man's requests and therefore they said

96
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,439
that now from this day onward we will

97
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,239
release hundred more patients 100

98
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,239
patient records every day

99
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,720
until vas demo pays up

100
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,519
and

101
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,840
at this point the threat started to feel

102
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,040
more real

103
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,360
also because they posted a couple of

104
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,680
patient records online

105
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,160
showcasing that they had actually hacked

106
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,800
this psychotherapy clinic faster

107
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,759
they also shared this hidden service url

108
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,960
this onion side with proof of their hack

109
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,840
it didn't take long for finnish media to

110
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,400
catch up on this

111
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,280
this thing was soon on the news on the

112
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,080
front page of every finnish news outlet

113
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,440
everyone

114
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,120
this person had really gotten the

115
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,639
media's attention

116
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,560
and not only was media writing about

117
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,080
this person

118
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,240
this person actually reached out to one

119
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,400
of the biggest media outlets called

120
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,199
ildesanomat in finland to henrik garcon

121
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,960
and one of the journalists working at

122
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,919
ildasanamat wanting to

123
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,039
wanting henrik hendrick to write a thing

124
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,639
a piece about him he clearly wanted to

125
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,360
narrate narrate the way that this thing

126
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,600
would be remembered he wanted to paint

127
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,240
vas tamo as the actual bad guy not

128
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,759
himself

129
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,720
and that's uh the first

130
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,280
time that it became quite clear that

131
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,840
this person is not just after

132
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,039
40 bitcoins from vasa this person is

133
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,320
also after fame and glory

134
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,360
and this is absolutely

135
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,479
unheard of

136
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,479
we all probably understand that

137
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,120
professional criminals they don't want

138
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,720
attention they want money and they want

139
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,560
to run away with the money but this

140
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,320
person they went

141
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,520
to such lengths to prove that they were

142
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,560
actually ransom man that they uploaded a

143
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800
proof for hendrik garcia and the

144
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,120
journalist on their hidden service to

145
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,960
prove that they were actually who they

146
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,639
were claiming to be

147
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,199
well naturally ill decent did not write

148
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,639
the point of ransom or ransom man on

149
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,680
their

150
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,840
on their news

151
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,560
on the same day vastama also reached out

152
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,720
to their patients everyone who was

153
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,840
affected and the victim of this data

154
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,800
breach they

155
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,520
send this relatively generic information

156
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,919
about yeah your information is now

157
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,080
potentially in the hands of an external

158
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,120
party

159
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,440
and that we are doing everything we can

160
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,080
to solve the situation

161
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,919
and this is probably the first time i

162
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,919
got an actual call from one of my

163
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,120
friends

164
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,400
she called me

165
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,759
and asked me

166
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,520
laura what can i do

167
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,000
my data is now out there

168
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,160
i went to great lengths to explain to

169
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,960
her how she can prevent from becoming a

170
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,400
victim of uh of identity theft so how

171
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,080
she can protect her social security

172
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,319
number how she can hide her address how

173
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,479
she can prevent from anyone from taking

174
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,280
credit on her name and she was like okay

175
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,520
that's all fine and good

176
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,080
but what about the things i i told my

177
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,840
therapist about

178
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,599
and to be fair

179
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,599
i didn't have an answer at that point i

180
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,960
just said that

181
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,560
well it's out there

182
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,680
and that's all we know

183
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,319
it didn't take long uh before

184
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,120
a lot of people online started to

185
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,160
hype throw out theories about this

186
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,479
ransom man about their capabilities

187
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,160
about who they were

188
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,240
and it didn't take a long time for

189
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,160
people to throw around the term script

190
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,400
kitty and script kitty probably most of

191
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,560
you know but it means a person who is

192
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,039
not that tech savvy but they use

193
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,919
pre-made scripts or find easy exploits

194
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,800
and exploit those in order to then

195
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,479
compromise data or

196
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,720
hinder business operations

197
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,680
and

198
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,160
the term script kitty was used quite

199
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,120
soon

200
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,440
in the discussion because of all the

201
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,599
evidence they started to leave behind

202
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,199
for example on their hidden service

203
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,879
website they copy pasted the html file

204
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,400
of the original post they made on tori

205
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,960
lauta and then on uli lauta

206
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,879
and that had a

207
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,800
specific kind of tracking cookie that

208
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,360
then led people at least

209
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,440
they thought that they would be able to

210
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,120
track this person down with the help of

211
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,599
this this tracking cookie so it seemed

212
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,199
like this person was doing a lot of

213
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,120
mistakes and they were super talkative

214
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,958
to people so they would conver have

215
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,719
conversations with people online on

216
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,719
these messaging boards for example so

217
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,919
people uh did not really think that they

218
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,080
were super like the super criminal

219
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,800
mastermind hacker from the get-go

220
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,880
but at this point we didn't really have

221
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,760
any

222
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,200
actual proof

223
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,600
or evidence about their capabilities so

224
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,680
i think this is important to understand

225
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,560
that

226
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,320
as security professionals we should

227
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,200
never underestimate someone based on

228
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,600
public discussion

229
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,760
thursday came around

230
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,800
and as promised ransom man released

231
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,680
hundreds more patient records online on

232
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,640
the hidden service website

233
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,560
people started to get anxious and for a

234
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,240
good reason they started to ask how can

235
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,880
i get my information removed how many

236
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,200
bitcoins does it take for for me to get

237
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,080
my information removed from uh from this

238
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,360
data dump

239
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,080
and uh once again franzenman was active

240
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,040
in commenting and throwing out uh some

241
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,959
some amount of bitcoins that people

242
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,440
could pay up

243
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,080
also on thursday they started to look

244
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,480
for a finished translator so that they

245
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,800
could send out a newsletter

246
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,600
on

247
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,959
air quotes

248
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,199
to the victims of the data breach

249
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,720
and

250
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,800
already by now it's good to understand

251
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,279
that ransom man and this person who is

252
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,440
behind this hack they have

253
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,640
every

254
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,480
finnish information security

255
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,959
professionals eyes on them

256
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,040
everyone is interested in them everyone

257
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,880
wants to catch them and for a good

258
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,800
reason this is what like what they're

259
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,279
doing it's absolutely horrendous

260
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,320
everyone wants to nail this person down

261
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,240
a lot of us working in the information

262
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,040
security field we started to supply the

263
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,200
police with evidence

264
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,120
through the official channels trying to

265
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,440
help the law enforcement or the finnish

266
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,360
national beret of investigation so

267
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,399
finnish go arbe giving them leads to

268
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,920
what could

269
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,320
hopefully lead them on track

270
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,959
to find ransom man

271
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,120
also in addition to this a lot of us

272
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,200
were helping the victims themselves

273
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,519
trying to give them ideas on how to

274
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,839
protect themselves for at least from

275
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,399
identity theft and things like these and

276
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,480
we were reaching out to people and

277
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,720
people were reaching out to us and and

278
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,440
we

279
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,480
tried to work together to make

280
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,800
make the impact of this hack at least a

281
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,320
tiny bit

282
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,680
smaller

283
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,160
but in addition to providing insights

284
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,760
and advice to police through the

285
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,160
official official channels

286
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,560
one intriguing thing that started to

287
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,839
happen was

288
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
i would say harmful speculations

289
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,680
and now i'm not talking about

290
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,160
speculations that take place in uh

291
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,600
reddit or ulilauda or even tori lauta or

292
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,680
these kind of places but kind of like

293
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,120
the speculations that experts gave on

294
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,160
public media speculations about who this

295
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,880
person could be and what had went down

296
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,839
before we had any actual evidence and

297
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:40,959
proof

298
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,720
and the thing here is that when we are

299
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,839
facing this sort of attack the sort of

300
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,040
thing where where an attacker is really

301
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,880
determined to get

302
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,560
uh money out of this sort of data

303
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,399
the person we want to help or the people

304
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,279
we want to help they are the victims so

305
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,519
we really need need to be careful in my

306
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,079
opinion as experts when we voice our

307
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,959
opinions so that they would be based on

308
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,639
actual solid evidence so it doesn't

309
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,800
become like this you probably know this

310
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,720
game this guess who game that we are

311
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,160
trying to kind of nail down not only the

312
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,880
how the hack happened before we know

313
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,000
anything about it uh in detail but also

314
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,839
the identity of the hacker because we uh

315
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,240
or ransom man in this case because we

316
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,639
don't have solid evidence we don't have

317
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,040
solid proof and we don't have any any

318
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
features we just have some text he has

319
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,399
written

320
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,880
we have a couple of clues that then

321
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,560
turned out to be

322
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,040
not real clues at all

323
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,279
so this is a really dangerous situation

324
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,600
because we are giving this person a lot

325
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,480
of

326
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,240
screen time and also potentially

327
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,959
exposing things that are happening on

328
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,440
the background how this person how we

329
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,399
are trying to nail this person down

330
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,880
but outside of this commentary naturally

331
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,279
the day is rolled by and on friday

332
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,320
something super weird happened

333
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,800
and weird as in this

334
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,639
whole thing could have played out so

335
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,760
differently but random man truly

336
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,320
 up at this point

337
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,959
they uh on their hidden service that i

338
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,680
mentioned before where they uh uploaded

339
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,880
100 more patient records every day on

340
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,200
friday morning this file size it was

341
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,360
previously like 70 megabytes or

342
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,160
something like this but on friday it

343
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,160
suddenly became 10 gigabytes and now it

344
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,800
just if you just increment a 100 let's

345
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,000
say just text lines of text or or just a

346
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,160
little bit of text it doesn't suddenly

347
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,800
bloat up to become 10 gigabytes of

348
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,279
information it was clear that in this

349
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,160
file there was something else

350
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,399
and people started to download this file

351
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,480
and what they found out that inside of

352
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,199
this file not only were there patient

353
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,240
records but also the scripts some source

354
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,040
code things that this person had used to

355
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,440
conduct their attacks and this was

356
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,760
actually really good that they messed up

357
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,440
in this way because

358
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,680
then there were for example ip addresses

359
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,760
of of

360
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,320
servers that they were using of the

361
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,839
cloud services that they were using

362
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,440
information on those

363
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,480
so

364
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,959
suddenly the tables turned completely

365
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,720
the bad thing about this

366
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,399
was that now

367
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,120
anyone on the internet could have had

368
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,440
the same patient records

369
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,880
at this point we had no idea who could

370
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,760
start ransoming wasdamo and the victims

371
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,160
next

372
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,120
and ransom man clearly noticed

373
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,399
their error

374
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,440
as they posted on tori lauta whoopsie

375
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,160
enjoy a big tar so they clearly knew

376
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,320
that they had

377
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,399
really just ruined all their chances

378
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,279
they had let the material go that they

379
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,680
could have used to run some people

380
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,040
um

381
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,720
so on saturday

382
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,760
it was

383
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,959
uh based on on uh the way that this data

384
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,000
was leaked and the evidence we had now

385
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,639
the clear evidence we had now it seemed

386
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,199
like ransom man now was desperate to

387
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,600
just get some bitcoins and i have to i

388
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,160
forgot to mention before but 40 bitcoin

389
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,720
at that time was uh around half a

390
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,360
million uh euros so we're talking about

391
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,639
quite a big amount of money

392
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,320
but on saturday

393
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,959
because they noticed that okay now

394
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,000
we have ruined our chances with vastama

395
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,079
at this point there's no way that they

396
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,920
would pay up because the data is already

397
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,839
out there anyone could have it

398
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,079
what they did sorry this isn't finished

399
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,320
i will translate the biggest parts of it

400
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,399
but they started to send out finnish

401
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,880
emails before they had just used english

402
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,560
here they could have used the translator

403
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,480
they were looking for for example they

404
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,120
started to send these emails out

405
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,240
uh

406
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,720
with with a help of a script they

407
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,800
modified it so that it had the person's

408
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,759
name the victim's name uh their day

409
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,759
birth date and their social security

410
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,279
number and in this message what it said

411
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,399
was that

412
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,040
um you probably have read on the news

413
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
what happened to vastama

414
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,399
vastamo has decided not to pay up so we

415
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,120
are reaching out to you personally

416
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,680
so you have the chance to pay

417
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,199
if you pay within 24 hours you have to

418
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,839
only pay a bitcoin worth of 200 euros

419
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,160
and this offer is only valid for 24

420
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,360
hours after that for the following 48

421
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,079
hours you have to pay bitcoin worth of

422
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,519
500 euros they had included a guidance

423
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,199
on how to

424
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,399
uh change like exchange euros into

425
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,759
bitcoin and they also included personal

426
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,120
bitcoin wallet uh inside uh inside this

427
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,039
message for every victim so it was

428
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,480
unique for every every victim

429
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,000
um

430
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,280
yeah

431
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,839
also yeah one more thing about this uh

432
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,799
is that

433
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,280
within three days if if there is no

434
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,559
payment the ransom man will release the

435
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,559
information they have on the specific

436
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,319
victim online

437
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,839
so this clearly seems like the one last

438
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,960
attempt to just scrape in some money and

439
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,400
now we're talking about

440
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,200
going from 40 bitcoins which was half a

441
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,919
million euro to ransoms that are just

442
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,039
hundreds of euros

443
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,039
on sunday

444
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,440
we get some official

445
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,640
information

446
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,960
into the events that had taken place at

447
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,679
vas demo into the background of what

448
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,799
kind of a hack had actually happened

449
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,679
and first of all bill latapio the ceo of

450
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:58,960
vastamo

451
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,640
he informs the media that he is

452
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,600
to resign he has been let go so he will

453
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,640
no longer be a ceo of vastama

454
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,840
there was a lot of drama happening in

455
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,600
vastama but the main thing that came out

456
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,039
on that day

457
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,039
was the

458
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,160
mention

459
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,120
of

460
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,640
the years

461
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,919
in which

462
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,000
the hack had actually taken place so

463
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,400
we're talking about 2018

464
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,559
and 2019

465
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,360
and if you're living in year 2020 this

466
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,520
is already it dates back to two years

467
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,720
ago

468
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,000
and uh in order to understand how this

469
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,520
all played out

470
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,000
i'll just show you this

471
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,440
timeline

472
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,679
so we now know that in november 2018

473
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,160
there was a first

474
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,000
breach of data

475
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,559
this happened because they had a mysql

476
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,840
database open to the internet

477
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,240
uh just like that

478
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,200
with

479
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,840
default password so that means basically

480
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,440
no password at all

481
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,200
at that time an attacker came in stole

482
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,320
40 000 patient records and disappeared

483
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,120
with that they were not detected at the

484
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,919
time

485
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,320
but in 2019 march

486
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,559
another hack happened

487
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,880
this time it was not just the data that

488
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,440
was stolen but also the data was

489
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,760
destroyed and a ransom note was left

490
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,960
behind

491
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,880
at this point the business operations of

492
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,640
western must have been hindered because

493
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,760
their database was effectively gone

494
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,559
so there's no way that for example villa

495
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,480
tapia did not know

496
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,919
that this this happened at that time

497
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,640
um i have to also remind you that

498
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,880
vastama was sold to inetra partners in

499
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,799
2019

500
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,400
which was then they were kept

501
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,160
in the darkness about this whole thing

502
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,000
so they didn't know this hack happened

503
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,400
but on march 2019 they improved their

504
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,360
security a little bit so that no further

505
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,600
access to data could happen

506
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,240
but then we are coming closer to october

507
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,320
2020.

508
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,799
in august 2020

509
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,919
a

510
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,480
third attacker came around

511
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,360
and this time it was the ransom man

512
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,919
they left the ransom note of asking for

513
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,080
40 bitcoins

514
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,840
with the threat of exposing the

515
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,439
information that they now possessed

516
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,799
they

517
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,200
at this point nixo a cyber security

518
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,039
company in finland operating also in

519
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,559
other countries

520
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,520
started to conduct a incident response

521
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,159
foreign six gig for bastama and with

522
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,360
vastama

523
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,799
in addition to that criminal

524
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,919
investigation was started looking into

525
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,480
uh into these monetary

526
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,200
requests or the threats and and also

527
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,840
investigating what happened and the

528
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,559
forensic investigation also showed that

529
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,559
data could have randomly been accessed

530
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,799
between november 2019 uh 2018 and march

531
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,480
2019

532
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,640
so we're talking uh

533
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,880
about quite a big

534
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,520
time span here

535
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,200
the problem with this

536
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,120
uh is that

537
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,600
we don't have evidence that would either

538
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,440
support or

539
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,320
support the fact that there was only one

540
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,679
attacker

541
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,919
but we don't have evidence that supports

542
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,840
that there would be multiple attackers

543
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,440
especially because we're talking about

544
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,240
such a long period of time there is just

545
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,200
no evidence to prove how many attackers

546
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,799
were there

547
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,520
it could be that the first

548
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,320
attacker who stole the 40

549
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,720
000 patient records is completely

550
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,480
different than ransom man it could be

551
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,320
that they are the same it could be that

552
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,600
the one a person who attacked on 2019

553
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,000
was the same or different we just don't

554
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,880
know

555
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,400
but that's the thing about forensic

556
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,799
evidence especially in a case like this

557
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,960
it is impossible to rule out that there

558
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,360
were multiple people involved in this

559
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,158
whole thing

560
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,840
next week comes around and on tuesday

561
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,360
that was the day

562
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,240
where

563
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,200
the

564
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
uh deadline arrived for paying up

565
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
bitcoin for the victims so if you wanted

566
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,919
to savor information from being leaked

567
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,799
online then by this day you had to pay

568
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,720
bitcoin

569
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,440
at this point there were a lot of civil

570
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,840
movements that started on twitter for

571
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,240
example there were this hashtag i won't

572
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,640
read hashtag i won't

573
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,600
share share

574
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,799
movements

575
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,440
people were actively saying that yeah we

576
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,679
will not read we will not share we are

577
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,760
not in for interested in your in your

578
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,960
information

579
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,559
in addition to that

580
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,200
people were voluntarily coming out with

581
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
their therapy sessions talking about

582
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,120
what they had gone through and and

583
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,960
publicly already kind of like exposing

584
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,559
the information that was going to be

585
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,200
public soon

586
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,520
i think this was really really important

587
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,919
this was such an important gesture from

588
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,320
finnish public stating that

589
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,559
we will not be ransomed with

590
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,640
because if we had been

591
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,880
afraid of ransom man if we had been

592
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,960
afraid of this person leaking our

593
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,880
information this whole thing could have

594
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,360
played out very differently

595
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,640
we could have ended up paying the

596
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,799
bitcoin and allowing this criminal to

597
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,320
have uh quite a lot of money in the end

598
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,280
but

599
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,400
we decided we will not condone this kind

600
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,760
of this kind of crime

601
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,679
some people uh

602
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,080
quite a few people actually uh like not

603
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,240
many people uh ended up paying bitcoin

604
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,000
some of them actually uh some of the

605
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
victims only paid

606
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,480
a very little bit uh like a very small

607
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,720
amount of bitcoin just so and i think

608
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,520
this was actually a really great sign of

609
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,000
uh of being vigilant of understanding

610
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,440
what is happening here because these

611
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,600
victims they paid only a little bit so

612
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,559
these transactions could be traced back

613
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,480
afterwards by the police

614
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,039
so uh and some people ended up paying

615
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,840
the whole sum of 200 or

616
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,679
uh 500 euros

617
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,279
but in the end

618
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,320
what ransom man got away with

619
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,080
was maybe two or three thousand euros

620
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,480
so that's not a lot and i don't know how

621
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,559
you feel if this kind of crime is worth

622
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,480
that much money especially now that you

623
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,720
have attract so much attention on

624
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,200
yourself everyone wants to catch you you

625
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,960
are like the most wanted person in

626
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,600
finland in the world even

627
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,559
yeah

628
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,320
in either case yeah

629
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
some people paid and then he also ended

630
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,320
up moving around those uh that money

631
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,400
afterwards

632
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,279
then end of tuesday came

633
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,360
but there was no

634
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,679
uh big data reveal or or this data that

635
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,679
the ransom man said that he will make

636
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,880
pop they will make a public

637
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,080
it never became public actually ransom

638
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
man started to disappear completely he

639
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,760
no longer

640
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,159
i accidentally used he but they i just

641
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,000
use he because random man but we don't

642
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,080
know even the identity

643
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,520
they

644
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,840
they disappeared slowly completely i

645
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,440
think at this point they understood yeah

646
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,360
it's better to go underground and never

647
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,960
be on the internet again

648
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,919
because when this person is found out it

649
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,279
will not be

650
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,919
nice for them

651
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
on the thursday uh this sort of a hectic

652
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,520
week started to come to a close

653
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,559
and throughout this week we had been uh

654
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,880
this whole thing had been on the news

655
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,799
all the time it had even bypassed all

656
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,880
the corona news and and things like this

657
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,080
that were still

658
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,919
really big at the time this was the

659
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,080
thing that people were talking about but

660
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,159
at this point there were no

661
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,840
or after thursday there were no clear

662
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,720
signs of friends and men again

663
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,400
and no more ransom threats or requests

664
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,480
to the victims or vast demo either

665
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,279
marco leponen the head of investigation

666
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,880
for for this uh criminal investigation

667
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,919
he actually already on sunday

668
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,840
said something that i thought that i

669
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,120
want to bring

670
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,039
up here because i think it kind of

671
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,840
showcased how this thing was handled and

672
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,279
how

673
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,960
how involved

674
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,000
we as cyber security scene where

675
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,440
with trying to crack this case

676
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,480
he said

677
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,799
he expressed on public like on live

678
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,440
television he's thanks to all white hat

680
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,400
community in finland for helping in

681
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,320
solving this case

682
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,480
and i thought this was

683
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,480
uh a sign

684
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,799
of well the whole thing how it played

685
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,760
out it was it was just

686
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,720
unprecedented we never had had this much

687
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,960
like working together and information

688
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,600
security professionals actually all

689
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,840
across companies across private and

690
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,159
public sectors just working together

691
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,320
trying to crack the case and providing

692
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,840
information through the official

693
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,399
channels behind the eyes of the media

694
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,000
and and behind the eyes of the public

695
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,320
just trying to find this person and

696
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,120
crack the case

697
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,520
naturally even though the week in this

698
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,000
week in october it's now fortunately

699
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,200
behind us

700
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,159
but these consequences are something

701
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,840
that we must live with every day

702
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,799
first of all what happened after october

703
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,559
2020

704
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,000
vastama

705
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,039
became one of the companies who did not

706
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,440
survive a cyber attack

707
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,279
a lot of times when

708
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,279
when a company is hacked

709
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,799
they actually like their business

710
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,279
processes are hindered for a bit and and

711
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,600
maybe if they are listed in

712
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,440
in public stocks their stocks go down

713
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,120
for a bit but they're able to bounce

714
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,919
back

715
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,240
but vastama was not one of these

716
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,480
companies they filed for bankruptcy a

717
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,919
little bit later

718
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,480
under a new ceo even

719
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,520
just not able to survive this kind of

720
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,919
hack and this kind of catastrophe of

721
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,480
leaking such sensitive information

722
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,880
in addition to that the

723
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,000
uh ransom man is still uh

724
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,840
well we have not called

725
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,919
the person yet so the criminal

726
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,000
investigation is still ongoing even

727
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,399
though it's not in the public that much

728
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,600
anymore there is relentless work going

729
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,480
into catching this person and finding

730
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,360
out

731
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,480
who they are and and uh

732
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,760
bringing them

733
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,240
to justice

734
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,399
but more than

735
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,279
just

736
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,919
a criminal attacker this ransomware a

737
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,720
man or more than just a company that

738
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,000
went under

739
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,480
we have to remember that this

740
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,840
data breach was about its victims it was

741
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,039
about the people who got affected

742
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,880
this was a personal

743
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,080
individual tragedy on such multiple

744
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,279
levels

745
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,640
not only for the 40 000 people who were

746
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,039
affected but their families with

747
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,679
everyone to everyone they knew because

748
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,320
it was not just their information that

749
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,279
got preached in plain text

750
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,039
it was also about the things that they

751
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,440
discussed the people they mentioned so

752
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,840
this ended up touching

753
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,360
almost all of us in finland

754
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,000
and the thing is that uh as i mentioned

755
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,600
that behind this whole thing this whole

756
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,880
big catastrophe was that there was

757
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,480
a database server open to the internet

758
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,039
and if we just go on showdown which is

759
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,440
most of you probably know but the search

760
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,279
engine for everything on the internet

761
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,080
and this is

762
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,559
just looking for my sequel server so

763
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,240
similar service that was uh used in

764
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,799
invastamo if we look

765
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,679
how many or if we search for how many of

766
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,520
these types of servers are out there

767
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,960
still today we end up with almost one

768
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,480
point one and a half million databases

769
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,240
that shouldn't ever be directly

770
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,120
connected to the internet naturally here

771
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,880
there could be

772
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,200
something else than default password

773
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,640
hopefully there is something else than

774
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,279
just the default password but this

775
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,679
really really brings the question

776
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,080
are the companies and the organizations

777
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,120
that really and truly need our help are

778
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,600
they actually reaching out to us

779
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,760
are they actually in a position that

780
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,960
they understand that they need our help

781
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,120
before we are setting a stage for next

782
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,600
vas dama to happen and this is not just

783
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,360
in finland as you can see it's global

784
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,080
we are potentially facing a situation

785
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,320
where we are handling or not we but

786
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,159
companies are handling

787
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,760
sensitive data

788
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,399
and now it could be up for grabs and

789
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,039
probably if it is there uh with default

790
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,640
password it is already gone it's not a

791
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,000
matter of if it's a matter of when

792
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,399
and not even default password but just

793
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,200
easy easily guessable passwords and as

794
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,960
you all know for

795
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,440
like being security professionals

796
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,519
databases are just one thing but there

797
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,600
are so many things out there on the

798
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,399
internet that shouldn't be there and i

799
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,039
think we are a long way

800
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,600
from the worlds and the society that we

801
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,279
can call actually safe and secure

802
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,039
and the thing is here

803
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,080
that when

804
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,600
we want

805
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,799
security

806
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,039
and when we want justice

807
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,120
we cannot be guessing

808
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,159
we cannot be just assuming that yeah we

809
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,080
are secure

810
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,320
maybe maybe any no one will hack us

811
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,320
maybe we are not interesting enough

812
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,720
maybe because we live so far up in the

813
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,120
north that no one is actually

814
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,840
bothering to look into our servers and

815
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,840
into our databases but that's where we

816
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,880
are wrong

817
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,919
and we

818
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,200
must

819
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,679
stop guessing and base

820
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:30,480
our

821
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,799
security and information security on

822
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,000
solid hard evidence so we can make

823
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,720
tomorrow more secure

824
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,190
thank you

825
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:47,840
[Applause]

826
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,918
you
