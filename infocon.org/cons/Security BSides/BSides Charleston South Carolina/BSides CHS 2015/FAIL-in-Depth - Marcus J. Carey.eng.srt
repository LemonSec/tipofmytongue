52
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:37,299
became a crypto guy cryptography during

53
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,710
that I didn't know this when I went went

54
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,630
in because the recruiter couldn't tell

55
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,880
me what what he what I did he didn't

56

know anything about what what ct's did

57
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,930

64
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,970
coolest places i worked at was a dc-3

65
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,530
dc-3 to defend<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber crime Center they</font>

66

do a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> investigations I taught a</font>

67
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:14,530
lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to do investigations</font>

or press ESC big government contractor

69
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,330

70
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,660
worked at CMS in Baltimore Baltimore

71
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:24,430
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latest of that latest Dow</font>

72
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:28,000
hardware they had the fire sale thing

73
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,770
and I had the apple guy in it that was

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,720
actually that datacenter are protected

75
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,959
that data science it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was one of the top</font>

76
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:38,380
security who's there after all this

77
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,830
defensive work and I went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> record</font>

78
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,720
seven I did a little bit of a some<font color="#E5E5E5"> edits</font>

79
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">and community related stuff there I also</font>

80
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,790
wrote some metasploit stuff is pretty

81
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:50,980
cool and if you follow me on twitter if

82
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know me on twitter I'm always making</font>

83
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:57,390
fun of both a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people because I</font>

84
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:59,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">think people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take stuff too serious so</font>

85
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,290
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this is what most people</font>

86
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,940
approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security is but since some</font>

87
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,220
of the dumb ol country boy I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

88
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,920
like to I like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw everything down</font>

89
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,810
so i can actually consuming myself and

90
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,809
so this right here this is an old-school

91
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,340
bicycle even tho it wouldnt it's not too

92
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,230
much different<font color="#CCCCCC"> from any other bicycle</font>

93
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,910
and so that's my first information

94
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,580
security and I know you've seen talk

95
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,480
some other talks today security hasn't

96
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:25,270
changed that much

97
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,180
the same things we saw ten years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago we</font>

98
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,729
stand today and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the facts so</font>

99
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,530
you know if that bicep could support me

100
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,870
I could probably ride it and i can write

101
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,090
any bicycle just don't bring any of

102
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">those those those those little too will</font>

103
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,530
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> chris is riding around here</font>

104
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:45,039
with and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll be good to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried step</font>

105
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:46,359
on the thing almost killed myself so the

106
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">big thing is information wants to be</font>

107
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,950
free just like water wants to pull and

108
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:53,830
collect I totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe information</font>

109
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:56,050
wants to be free and those acts some

110
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,370
kind heck it might even be biblical it

111
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,620
talks about whatever is done in dark

112
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,870
will come to light so whatever data you

113
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,190
have on your network whatever emails

114
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,140
that you don't want nobody to find out

115
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:09,160
about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's going to be probably</font>

116
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:11,260
one day and so something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking</font>

117
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,030
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> night in my corset I thought</font>

118
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:16,030
as I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in choosing</font>

119
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:18,489
methodology and Dana that kind of sucks

120
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:21,010
for viewing it but then that's turrible

121
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:24,010
colors are up here this is

122
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:27,520
reconnaissance this is an attack this is

123
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:29,620
entrenchment and over here is abuse and

124
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,140
this cycle continues the right

125
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,430
organization i'll be posting my<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides</font>

126
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,349
so you can actually you'll probably be

127
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,360
able to see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better view of this but</font>

128
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">this one in choosing our methodology is</font>

129
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,230
a continuation and it goes on all the

130
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,719
time so even when somebody gets this

131
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,460
entrenchment phase they start recounting

132
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">their and they aunts more attacks and</font>

133
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:51,130
all that stuff so this is not the way I

134
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:54,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">explain this also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm on the old</font>

135
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,890
school dude i started my first hardcore

136
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,710
in the networking with CCNA back in the

137
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:04,030
day cisco certified network associate us

138
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:07,930
up my pen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what CCNA built on is</font>

139
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:09,460
it built on the OSI model and so what

140
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,370
I'm going to do here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I'm going to</font>

141
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:15,070
unpack the OSI model and talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

142
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:17,110
attacks because I don't see a lot of

143
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:19,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">people talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

144
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:22,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">how I'm going to do it let's talk about</font>

145
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,609
physical attacks and physical being

146

anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that nature and this is what</font>

147
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,540
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> fail to do so if you just look at</font>

148
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,659
the OSI model and walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> through it you</font>

149
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">can see what people fail to do so first</font>

150
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,980
first thing like it's a network closet

151
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,719
like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you walk by network</font>

152
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:41,620

153
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:45,010
wide open I know I do you know so funny

154
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:50,050
a funny thing I know this guy let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> call</font>

155
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:53,590
him Bob the is empty network closet God

156
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,990
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> when plugged in Wi-Fi hotspot and</font>

00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,640
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 14</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years old and so he got really</font>

173
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,230

184
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,230
door or you can walk outside to the

185
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,219
street and the garage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can walk back</font>

186
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,220
around the front doors open

187

say he get he uh he stayed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the garage</font>

188
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,700
five minutes later he turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lock</font>

189
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,289
and he walked back in so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like wow</font>

190
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,940
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool and he said dad did</font>

192
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,860
so he went on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do some pretty cool</font>

193
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff he's a programmer he didn't go to</font>

194
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">college he hated he ate at school and he</font>

195
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,370
doesn't work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> rapid seven full-time</font>

196
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,960
since he was 17 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's kind of beast so</font>

197
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,810
but the rock creek and peace from a

198
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,960
physical aspect that actually teaches us

199
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:39,209
a lot I just we have all we have office

200
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,710
in Austin installed a cipher lock the

201
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,570
other day and the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I did was</font>

202
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:44,910
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to circumvent the lock I end up</font>

203
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:48,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">shimming a lot right after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i installed</font>

204
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,829
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so for a normal person normal</font>

205
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,050
people don't think that way normal

206
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:54,510
people put it put a lock in place and

207
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,040
they just go so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like I was</font>

208
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,470
determined<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to circumvent this</font>

209
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,290
lock so i ended up having to go back to

210
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,910
lowes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> bond some more parts you know</font>

211
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">i bought this like little thing to keep</font>

212
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,439
it from being easy to shim i bought a

213
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">dell book because thinking like an</font>

214
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,080
attacker think that that's part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

215
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,130
we do and so far burkharts that's

216
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,830
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're never going to be able</font>

217
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,689
to that happens all the time especially

218
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:21,600
back in the day<font color="#CCCCCC"> i remember that has to</font>

219
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:24,330
happen all the time network taps<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

220
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,270
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like i said that network</font>

221
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:30,150
closet that that that that Bob put a

222
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,920
Wi-Fi hotspot is<font color="#E5E5E5"> he Bob could have put a</font>

223
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,420
hot put a he could have put a network

224
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,630
tap and I'm could have been still mile

225
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:47,750
traffic so and here's a here's a

226
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:50,660
mandatory lock lock fell for her Wow

227
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,730
really yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bill to the</font>

228
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,500
data link<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer real quick those are</font>

229
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,730
those traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> sniffing Dickon it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

230
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,350
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> at that you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> install a</font>

231
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,270
physical top and then you can start

232
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:02,180
sniffing traffic all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides will be</font>

233
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:03,920
available to sub max Murphy that's a

234
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,239
proper technique especially Wi-Fi and

235
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,479
all that stuff so these are things you

236
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,730
have to think about a defense right and

237
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,350
broadcast broadcast storm you can easily

238
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,300
disrupt the network by plugging into

239
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:17,780
sorts plugging it into two different

240
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:19,849
things that whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks done right</font>

241
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:22,910
and you can like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get general</font>

242
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:25,070
frequencies as far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you</font>

243
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,380
can jam you can intercept intercept

244
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,760
stuff so does all kinds of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

245
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,500
what I like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do is I like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

246
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this in a logical manner so these</font>

247
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,280
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> are somebody want to disrupt you</font>

248
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,410
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the logical things that they</font>

249
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,410
could do at certain levels some of these

250
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,520
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> detect you know</font>

251
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,650
until you walk into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network closet</font>

252
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:46,880
and like bang who put<font color="#CCCCCC"> this birds here</font>

253
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:54,170
you know so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> representation of</font>

254
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:56,870
a broadcast storm what Doug at the same

255
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,760
side again<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool do because that</font>

256
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:02,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">forgive me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so that were clear</font>

257
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:05,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">textures</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like IP spoofing so I you know</font>

258
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:07,370
what's cool about this like Newton that

259
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,370
anybody would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like dat IP spoofing and</font>

260
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:12,740
all that stuff the problem with with

261
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:14,240
spoofing IP source addresses is the

262
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:19,010
traffic doesn't normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> write back to</font>

263
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">you but the cool thing is you can spoof</font>

264
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,490
the source IP address and you explore

265
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,500
can change something on an opposite

266
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,839
network you don't sometimes you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

267
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,339
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the package back you can</font>

268
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,740
just sit in traffic and up and off it

269
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:35,810
goes right so those things like that

270
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:38,570
there's writing manipulation there's

271
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,069
been several cases where all of a sudden

272
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,150
all the traffic on internet was getting

273
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:43,670
right with you trying or something like

274
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,480
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know pay no attention to the</font>

275
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,750
man behind a car

276
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,060
half an hour and there's ICMP related

277
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:52,699
type of text now I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> I heard somebody</font>

278
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:55,160
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> releasing the tool for icmp tongs</font>

279
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:59,149
and stuff so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the kind of</font>

280
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:01,430
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can happen at that later you</font>

281
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:04,490
go to transport layer attack you can do

282
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:07,609
you know since in flooding kinect kinect

283
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,709
scanning and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> manys our tax per se but</font>

284
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,800
they're definitely tools and things that

285
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:15,319
people fail to prevent and fell deep its

286
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,959
engine sometimes there's also possibly a

287
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,290
session hijacking their session layer

288
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:24,439
text so I I said last night is funny i

289
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,969
love I like being controversial so last

290
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,519
night I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I don't believe session</font>

291
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,949
session on session doesn't exist right

292
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:32,600
and so somebody pointed out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me what</font>

293
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:34,370
about cookies and all that stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

294
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,620
keeps some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of session state make</font>

295
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:39,170
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll add it to my slides then it's</font>

296
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,399
a long you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guys the guys</font>

297
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,839
were in the class last night<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

298
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,360
probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking about that</font>

299
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,519
and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> like token still and so i would</font>

300
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,180
say like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay those are session related</font>

301
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:53,420
and then perhaps you know people can do

302
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:55,189
stuff to all those levels right so so

303
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,810
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm what I'm saying is you see that</font>

304
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,100
like what when people think about

305
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,459
security I don't know if they're

306
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,839
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a logical</font>

307
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:04,339
methodology like this and so what I'm

308
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to do is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paint a picture</font>

309
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:07,730
like bone these are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> different this</font>

310
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:14,329
is things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could happen at each</font>

311
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:16,970
level presentation later<font color="#CCCCCC"> text so our</font>

312
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:19,040
image rendering right like there's like

313
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,660
a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you got to exploit</font>

314
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,689
dev a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are trying to show</font>

315
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:25,370
big images big a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of crap and</font>

316
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,589
create some kind of overflow or

317
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:30,490
something that's what a lot of export

318
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:33,139
deficit that's what all this people do

319
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,190
buzzing and all that stuff and people

320
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:37,190
are doing this an automated fashion

321
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:40,069
there's like flash flash and things like

322
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:41,750
that or presenting data mp3 players and

323
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,910
stuff like that that our thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

324
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:46,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you know really it's only</font>

325
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that is patch</font>

326
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:51,610
and so everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets a pass for all</font>

327
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:54,120
that stuff there's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> application</font>

328
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:57,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific stuff walking through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OSI model</font>

329
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:00,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">continue on it so we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Java related</font>

330
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,780
stuff that's another big thing so you

331
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,640
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically that's just how computers</font>

332
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,900
work i'm passing packets passing data

333
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,110
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> booming it goes all the way up to</font>

334
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:10,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">java and it you know you could exploit</font>

335
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,700
java dns reflection which is interesting

336
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,670
because the java piece is usually on it

337
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,980
client-side far as like a client side of

338
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,780
browser browsers or try to load some

339
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,430
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> java but then like you have the</font>

340
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,829
dns reflection attack which usually

341
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,300
servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> stand sitting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the internet or</font>

342
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,030
susceptible to but it's still an

343
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:30,160
application level protocol slow learners

344
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:33,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">that affects web servers or whatnot</font>

345
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,560
stuff like that like<font color="#E5E5E5"> d dot type stuff so</font>

346
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,630
the only thing you know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> those kind</font>

347
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:42,099
of things if you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just log all the</font>

348
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:48,340
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just in at this yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i said i</font>

349
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:50,290
was so um<font color="#E5E5E5"> no that covers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit of</font>

350
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:53,050
ground her because we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

351
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:55,209
best like the OSI model right and so for

352
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,469
each one of those and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll offer a</font>

353
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit advice on each one of those</font>

354
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,570
things but just looking at through it

355
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:04,479
plain and simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> what does security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

356
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:06,580
tell city kind of tells protecting like

357
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,380
really like protecting all that stuff so

358
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:11,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you're not if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're just worried</font>

359
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,030
about you know web app security which it

360
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,459
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like an application letter</font>

361
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:17,020
right but you're not focusing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

362
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,010
network closet being told you open and

363
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,990
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see if anything off your</font>

364
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:22,350
network anyway still everything then

365
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,970
you're failing so we kind of get

366
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:27,280
impressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trudy what we do is we like we</font>

367
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,440
have sport that squirrel dog dog versus

368
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,230
spoil syndrome where every time a spa

369
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,910
blue shiny thing let's look at that look

370
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,620
at that but to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a comprehensive</font>

371
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,640
security program you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be you have</font>

372
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:42,920
to excel at all layers of the OSI model

373
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:50,389
so speaking of that

374
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:52,099
this is my boy here my boy ed he's the

375
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:54,880
authority on<font color="#CCCCCC"> all internet security right</font>

376
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:58,720
now by believes everything this guy says

377
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,279
so the funny thing about him is a is I

378
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,040
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow me I do talk about</font>

379
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,420
violating person a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time in</font>

380
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,790
validating personnel people can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be your</font>

381
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,170
wickets link from all kind of ways it

382
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,449
could be somebody that steals your

383
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:14,269
secrets but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have an operator</font>

384
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:16,849
in your sock that absolutely for lack of

385
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:19,519
a better wear it sucks what if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

386
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:22,070
if is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> person inside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that this</font>

387
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,389
person is terrible at their job I would

388
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:26,269
consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a person to threaten some</font>

389
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:28,070
organization so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> people need to</font>

390
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:31,070
start having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of a better way of</font>

391
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:33,350
evaluating those people and it enters a

392
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:37,850
lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that even close</font>

393
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:39,620
stuff like social engineering so let's

394
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,000
plenty about social engineering I love

395
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,670
all my<font color="#E5E5E5"> social engineers I thought I</font>

396
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,800
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a full-time job I</font>

397
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,719
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's like a full-time job I</font>

398
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,760
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we all can probably do something</font>

399
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,140
related to social engineering and this

400
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,390
is controversial because I notice hope

401
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:55,069
people dedicated this kind of stuff but

402
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:58,130
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing was yes you should definitely</font>

403
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:00,769
be social engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> your people but</font>

404
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">again you have a seven layer or son bob</font>

405
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:05,120
hope that you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be protected as</font>

406
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:09,049
well so don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> give so focused on one</font>

407
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:11,239
simple thing right so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say so</font>

408
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:12,799
soon as you know personnel try to front

409
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,569
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you have to have mechanisms in</font>

410
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,099
place to catch like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edward snowden's</font>

411
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:18,079
and you also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure that the</font>

412
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:21,530
people that supposed to be applying

413
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:24,260
patches are<font color="#CCCCCC"> plum patches</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right what</font>

414
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:27,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">I see a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot organizations is that</font>

415
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:30,830
there's no you can do all the scanning

416
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:33,290
if you use Nessus all day find find some

417
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:35,689
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problem but unless you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

418
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:38,330
process in place to get that stuff

419
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,720
remediated it's never going to happen I

420
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,490
mean

421
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,080
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know in some situations you can</font>

422
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,330
find some a year ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's still</font>

423
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,570
impacts now you probably had something

424
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:54,049
like that in your organization what's

425
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:55,820
the get a minute foundation so so anyway

426
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:58,549
everything cyber here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found this</font>

427
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:03,620
gun at heb local store in Texas cyber

428
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:07,010
squirt is a word yeah this is one of

429
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,658
them then but some organizations my by

430
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,370
that thinking of some kind of protection

431
00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:14,140
is going to shoot them I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> shoot</font>

432
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:14,139
this at hackers this on my network right

433
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:22,220
yes or huh yeah so one of the things i

434
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:24,020
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do talk about a lot is like</font>

435
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,090
validating the products<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because it</font>

436
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:30,049
says it does something doesn't mean it's

437
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:31,280
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it so just because it</font>

438
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:34,639
says cyber squirt on her doesn't mean

439
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,960
it's going to feel attackers and uh but

440
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">i see a lot of products will cool names</font>

441
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,330
deduce that did stuff like that so

442
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:43,909
validate the products you got to have

443
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:46,010
some way to validate the products<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

444
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:48,830
I see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of big sales when I was at</font>

445
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:51,350
at CMS place I do like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we used to ice to</font>

446
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,059
a bake-off I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bring</font>

447
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:54,770
three different vendors in and we would

448
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:56,649
test it and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we could</font>

449
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:59,120
validate the controls and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff</font>

450
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:01,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">enlightened and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nine times that soon</font>

451
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,870
none of this stuff really works<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they</font>

452
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,129
are on the same product they would have

453
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:07,010
the gardener certifcate you know

454
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:12,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">gardener magic quadrant but not it in</font>

455
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:14,720
heart I'm like wow did seriously so but

456
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,629
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the products but you got to</font>

457
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,820
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the process works as well</font>

458
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:23,530
so did your information security program

459
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,530
look anything like this diagram where

460
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,090
yeah but it said if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

461
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:33,940
organization can't figure it out you

462
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:36,879
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the processes and many</font>

463
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:39,909
organizations is just not together you

464
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:42,189
know that you know it's it's terrible so

465
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:44,499
I've advocate people doing simulations

466
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,899
don't do in training doing adversary

467
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:49,480
simulations during penetration testing

468
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:52,029
but actually along the blue team to try

469
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,789
to defend against it and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that</font>

470
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:57,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">it has to happen on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> law networks it</font>

471
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:58,990
can't happen in some kind of vacuum you

472
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,908
can't go to sends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn a lot of</font>

473
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,860
stuff it sends and then come back and

474
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:04,499
try to implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> send stuff on your</font>

475
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,658
network because you know how to Sam sup

476
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:09,999
all right so you got to know your stuff

477
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:12,820
you got to know your process and I say

478
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:16,809
like you shouldn't be envious of

479
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:18,759
somebody else's program you might go see

480
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:20,980
talks and stuff and they talk about this

481
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">is how we do it it's so on so place but</font>

482
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,039
I bet<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you went to so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on so its</font>

483
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,619
place it wouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that smooth and</font>

484
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:28,570
they're not really doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so not as</font>

485
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:30,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> non-solid saying everybody</font>

487
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:35,230
hurting and you have to do what fits you

488
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:37,090
that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can't you can't</font>

489
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:40,749
listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> up what to what these other</font>

490
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:44,499
people say too much you also have to

491
00:20:40,749 --> 00:20:47,230
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you know that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

492

factor look on like me though he doesn't

493
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:53,769
have epic bird so but but but this slide

494
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:55,840
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this represents is people blowing</font>

495
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:57,399
money and losing money and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what</font>

496
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">they call that the rapper's called</font>

497
00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:03,520
making it rain they like to money<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

498
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:07,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">Club some networks of making aranda</font>

499
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,879
with the data loss so you got you got to

500
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:11,710
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to if you see attackers on your</font>

501
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,330
network right now doing this like

502
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,220
shooting your credit cards your money

503
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:18,100
whatever off the network you need to

504
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:20,590
understand what's popular with that so I

505
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,909
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's dlp that's all kind of</font>

captures you should be able to

509
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:29,800
understand what exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going on</font>

510
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:33,490
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody in</font>

making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it rain dollars off your network</font>

513
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:43,290
right now also<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got to be aware of</font>

514
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:48,129
lateral movement anybody see this play

515
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:50,170
the mommy it was like maybe like eight

516
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:53,020
levels in the last four seconds of the

517
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:54,580
game unfortunately this guy's knees down

518
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,040
on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> lateral</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right here and the</font>

519
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,570
referee<font color="#CCCCCC"> is totally messed up to play the</font>

520
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,360
referee we made<font color="#E5E5E5"> like three or four evers</font>

521
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:03,939
on this one play it send it again right

522
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,340
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is like if your referee on</font>

523
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,720
your network are you seeing people<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

524
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,060
lateral movement over over your network

525
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,710
they throwin laterals they like they

526
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,200
like high-fiving so it looks like you're

527
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:16,120
seeing if you have been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CCD see the</font>

528
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">hackers is a half out of each other's</font>

529
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:22,800
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> just somebody in China and Russia</font>

530
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,800
right now doing that on your network Oh

531
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:31,780
where's Michelle it's hilarious<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I</font>

532
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:34,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">feel so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when I go to CCDC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a big but</font>

533
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:37,030
like then which you notice if somebody

534
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:43,330
is like totally only your network like

535
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:45,850
that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know so also you</font>

536
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:50,320
need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at doing egress</font>

537
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:52,629
filtering right for some reason most

538
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,980
places are though they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not they're</font>

539
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:59,080
not doing egress egress filtering in

540
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,120
you're not on camera but show you can be

541
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,520
totally truthful and honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> with me how</font>

542
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,540
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you guys implement egress</font>

543
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:10,870
filtering on your network or yet so we

544
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:12,740
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to let us say so we got</font>

545
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:14,989
but less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten percent agree</font>

546
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:19,340
around ten percent of the room that the

547
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:20,510
activity does egress filtering so of

548
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,100
course if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what egress</font>

549
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:25,040
filtering is egress filtering is

550
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:28,070
blocking outbound communications right

551
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:30,530
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I recommend that you do that only</font>

552
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:33,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost like they say when I was at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

553
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:36,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">meat on a need-to-know basis like a neat</font>

554
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:38,300
to have access basis so<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the</font>

555
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:42,020
only ports that should be going on on

556
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:44,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">your network is 8443 out front from a</font>

557
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:47,480
client right and in and so they should

558
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">even be sent an email without hitting a</font>

559
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,940
server inside or anything so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say</font>

560
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:55,040
like 80 and 443 are the only ports

561
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,440
normally<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

562
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting out to internet for internal</font>

563
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,420
communications there's all kind of other

564
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:04,850
ports but like why are we what you know

565
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:08,090
I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends that went in to do pen</font>

566
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,740
testing and incident response but

567
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,110
princesses will go into a network and

568
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:14,270
they like they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a show but that's</font>

569
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:16,729
like Oh somebody's already hurdle but

570
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:19,309
they beat me her<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nurse them they don't</font>

571
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:22,880
ftp what do you have ftp open outside it

572
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:24,740
around your network you know so your

573
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,480
network should look young network far

574
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,059
wrong policy out patong should not

575
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,140
should not look like Swiss cheese that's

576
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:34,610
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have switched season there</font>

577
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,800
there's also several tunneling methods

578
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,659
on getting data out of your network

579
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">servers typically or whatever you call</font>

580
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:43,700
it so you know I went to the George W

581
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:48,740
Bush school of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pronounced and stuff so</font>

582
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:50,990
forgive me so with with this like you

583
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,940
know its dns telling pretty popular and

584
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,920
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy stolen last night there's</font>

585
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:57,350
some kind of ICMP tunneling tool suppose

586
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,870
we just got released I believe they're

587
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:02,659
like I'm like those<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that are you</font>

588
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:04,520
know you can send stuff about HTTP s and

589
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:06,290
that's kind of like a form of tunneling

590
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,000
because hey you can't see it if it's

591
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:11,870
encrypted right so what I recommend

592
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,390
people do is they just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bert i</font>

593
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:16,209
recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking SSL and i know this</font>

594
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:19,520
is blasphemy in a prophecy community<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

595
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:21,020
think you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring ssl</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> entirely each</font>

596
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,299
you have air gap before you send it back

597
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,289
up

598
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:28,400
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing in a new</font>

599
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:30,770
network huh you haven't a prostitute

600
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:35,840
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of rare though I mean it not I</font>

601
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:37,340
feel good nothing huh oh he<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants your</font>

602
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,000
security company who do you work<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us</font>

603
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:43,309
utility<font color="#CCCCCC"> utila so we have like two people</font>

604
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,860
in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are doing that right</font>

605
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:48,070
now so what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that many</font>

606
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:51,549
organizations people are still in beta

607
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:56,600
like crazy and you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be able to</font>

608
00:25:51,549 --> 00:26:00,289
detect it at all so having<font color="#CCCCCC"> said that</font>

609
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,360
your treasure could be leaving your

610
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:04,549
network in one of these different

611
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,500
protocols that you can't read there's

612
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:09,770
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> emailer protocols that are easy to</font>

613
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:12,230
decipher and you can correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> me if I'm</font>

614
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:15,770
wrong here<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I when I was in working</font>

615
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:18,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the government arena Microsoft their</font>

616
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:21,559
email protocol was you couldn't because

617
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:23,720
you couldn't it was like proprietary

618
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:26,690
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm some of the pure Microsoft</font>

619
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,929
communications from your work station to

620
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,740
the mail server<font color="#CCCCCC"> what was unreadable</font>

621
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:36,260
y'all familiar with that protocol

622
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:37,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">timeout so is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it still that way yeah so</font>

623
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,799
what you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even read mark something</font>

624
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">off from from from I mean when I was</font>

625
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:44,629
there so what it in attackers what do

626
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,510
they do they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be exfiltrating</font>

627
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:49,309
data using email client they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

628
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:53,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">be exfiltrating data using your web</font>

629
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:55,428
browser that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypted so you need to</font>

630
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:58,490
you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come up with some kind of</font>

631
00:26:55,429 --> 00:27:00,200
way to know what's going on is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that dlp</font>

632
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:02,360
I mean I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know I mean that</font>

633
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,450
does tons of solutions that does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

634
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,459
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I said on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your network can you</font>

635
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:10,429
tell if somebody is still in data from

636
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:13,429
your network and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times the</font>

637
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:15,980
answer that is a resigning no nobody can

638
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:18,559
see it and it's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> every day you</font>

639
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want the FBI and mandiant be the</font>

640
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,740
first people to come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your doorstep</font>

641
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,360
FBI coming or whatever it may

642
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:33,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a check that you need</font>

643
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:36,120
son<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so also fermenting for</font>

644
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:37,770
bikaner this is another thing where it

645
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:43,500
will require an active network

646
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:46,679
monitoring and all that stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm so</font>

647
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,540
what's a this is this is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font>

648
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,970
to require this is going to have to

649
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,710
require you may be having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be creative</font>

650
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:55,140
but whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to do is you need</font>

651
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:57,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">to determine what's good and what's bad</font>

652
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:00,270
traffic area network the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing with</font>

653
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,679
without anybody on participating hunt

654
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:04,740
teams or anything like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

655
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,929
might get it convert yeah so the first

656
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,150
most important thing about a hunt team

657
00:28:06,929 --> 00:28:11,730
type situation i believe is having some

658
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:13,710
kind of gold bill right a gold bill

659
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:16,559
meaning you know every process this

660
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:19,890
happening on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer in a normal</font>

661
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:22,139
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so by knowing that</font>

662
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:25,170
you can block out like<font color="#E5E5E5"> private eighty</font>

663
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:27,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent of your home machine and so then</font>

664
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:30,420
you just focus on what's abnormal right

665
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:32,730
and you can also know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what processes are</font>

666
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:34,620
generating<font color="#E5E5E5"> what like web calls and stuff</font>

667
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,000
like that should these processes be

668
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,010
doing that should these processes be

669
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,040
doing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff</font>

670
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:42,510
all right and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that bed I was like</font>

671
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,000
this is the traffic good this is that

672
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:50,700
traffic piece but also on the system on

673
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,860
the processes legit and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I</font>

674
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:57,450
definitely advocate how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have</font>

675
00:28:52,860 --> 00:29:00,330
internal pin test teams in town princess

676
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:05,100
teams we getting probably like a fifteen

677
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:07,260
to twenty percent of response on them so

678
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,510
your internal you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> yo you have</font>

679
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,830
actually doing these kind of things

680
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:13,800
trying to do these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see if you</font>

681
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:17,580
are detected all right keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 women</font>

682
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:19,860
keep it real how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can you say</font>

683
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:24,540
or seeing the traffic on a normal basis

684
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:25,899
based on what your activity and we got a

685
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:31,360
resounding

686
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:34,950
okay cool up okay we<font color="#CCCCCC"> got one elite</font>

687
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:38,260
commando<font color="#CCCCCC"> 22 elite commandos of the house</font>

688
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:40,210
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet so it's kind of like people are</font>

689
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,580
intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're feeling we're failing at</font>

690
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:45,340
this and people have active active

691
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,810
people testing the system's up I've got

692
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,419
a question like anybody want to tell me

693
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:53,679
why why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it not working can't give me</font>

694
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:56,260
feedback you know any any volunteers why

695
00:29:53,680 --> 00:30:01,870
are people who are people<font color="#E5E5E5"> felling at</font>

696
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:07,060
this so so first comment is it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

697
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:09,689
priority money so money what does money

698
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,690
have to do with it

699
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:27,200
yeah so is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it okay so basically that</font>

700
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:29,420
that response was it's a money thing we

701
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">people can't afford having pentoses do</font>

702
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:35,440
stuff and they can't afford people

703
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:35,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">responding to pen testers is expensive</font>

704
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:46,990
yeah so I lack of understanding

705
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:54,700
complacency pressure the higher if it

706
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:56,890
article<font color="#CCCCCC"> your sailor yo failure you're</font>

707
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,240
feeling your salesman I thought you I

708
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:01,060
thought I had a brother in the house he

709
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">said he's a seller so my clients is that</font>

710
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:05,800

727
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:54,180
able to do those exact same<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

732
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:09,370
i would put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of scope on</font>

733
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:11,080
for the pen test I would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

734
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:13,300

738
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,750

740
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:28,780
your princess somebody will coming on

741
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:32,940
run a bunch of automated stuff you know

742
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:36,370
like re Cougars give me give me my money

743
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:39,580
so some way you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify your</font>

744
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:43,030
blind spots on network and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

745
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:46,210
the classical car blinds right like you

746
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:47,170
can't see how to eat windows like last

747
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:53,560
night I was right

748
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:57,310
dmz yano dmz yo no dmg car truck he got

749
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:59,590

750
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:03,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I was like old-school scooby-doo</font>

751
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:04,750
joint right I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I was on so far</font>

752
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,550
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> serengeti something going through</font>

753
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,410
the streets of Charleston last night and

754
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,580
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how humid see their car</font>

755
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:11,830
because you know like it's funny how

756
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:14,230
each party you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and this is what I</font>

757
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:16,540
talk about each car you get in it has

758
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:19,030
different blind spots right so I'm

759
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:20,470
really drive a minivan you know I got

760
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:23,050
four kids so we have to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a minivan</font>

761
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:25,390
when the younger but I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to out the</font>

762
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:27,220
house now but every man he's getting

763
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:29,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that minivan you know but i have to add</font>

764
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:31,120
the buckland to give me a minivan so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

765
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:32,890
have to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> me something that little</font>

766
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,530
mirrors on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the side of the minivan so i</font>

767
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:40,960
can see up how many minivan driving men

768
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:43,629
around her stop started brothers so so

769
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,490
in just like every car you get like

770
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,230
every network is different<font color="#CCCCCC"> right again</font>

771
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,670
like just because you did something if

772
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,010
your last place don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it's going to</font>

773
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:53,440
work there so you got to understand what

774
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:55,810
those blind spots are looks important

775
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,240
first of all like what's important or

776
00:33:55,810 --> 00:34:01,000
mark where's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> treasure and how am I</font>

777
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,040
going to figure my network and I am I

778
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,870
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put my controls in place to see</font>

779
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:12,130
those blind spots because at the end of

780
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:19,000
the day you only you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can prevent forest</font>

781
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:21,640
fires in and security breaches so that I

782
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,820
went pretty quick there but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am over</font>

783
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:26,168
I'm up for questions and I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

784
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,860
keep the dialogue<font color="#E5E5E5"> go for a little bit</font>

785
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:28,859
any questions

786
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:40,500
and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things here a lot is you</font>

787
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:44,489
know we gotta fix everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hacker</font>

788
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:47,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">last five1 bitch get in trouble is a</font>

789
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:47,868
definable right

790
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:58,830
from the hackathon I guess yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font>

791
00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:00,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">body more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than just one you'll have to</font>

792
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:03,590
knock over 12

793
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:06,799
yo so of what you find are from an

794
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:10,730
attacker perspective is and and so the

795
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:13,430
question was or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the statement was a one</font>

796
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:15,980
dealing with red team vs evil team what

797
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:18,049
you are what you run into a lot that's

798
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:22,099
my phone oh well think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm being rude as</font>

799
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:24,320
a mother<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so so</font>

800
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:26,420
you have this this whole blue team

801
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">versus red team or attacker attacker has</font>

802
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:31,660
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> right one time a blue team</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> member</font>

803
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:34,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">has to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be right all the time right so</font>

804
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:38,149
there's always multiples to get in for

805
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:39,800
sure attackers are human and they want

806
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:43,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find the easiest way to get in right</font>

807
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,810
and so the first way they're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

808
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,089
not going to spin see much more effort

809
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:49,099
don't spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> more time on doing their</font>

810
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:51,349
back doors setting up all that stuff and

811
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:53,599
and I call it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system administration</font>

812
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:55,250
piece of an incessant well you make sure

813
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get as many citizens we can many</font>

814
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,550
credits as you can and all that stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

815
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:01,160
they're spending more time on that and

816
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:03,200
that's what's important I remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

817
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,609
I first got my show the guy who taught

818
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,379
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot about hacking stuff was a</font>

819
00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:08,540
Johnny long he's a good friend of mine

820
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,950
and so I moved back in the day I need to

821
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:13,009
get really<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited when I got a shell</font>

822
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:15,080
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he said like slap me like a dude who</font>

823
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:16,880
cares my second there's so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

824
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:20,119
stuff to do and all that stuff it kind

825
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">of remind me of so the answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

826
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:23,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">attacker only cursor on one thing in a</font>

827
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:26,480
nice try<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he's trying to insurance</font>

828
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:28,369
himself on the system so so people

829
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,750
factors don't get excited on how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

830
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:31,700
different ways they can get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

831
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,140
network that that's something they

832
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,598
probably do app there's something they

833
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:39,740
can do after the fact and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would call</font>

834
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:42,170
that more entrenchment so yep from from

835
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:44,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">a blue team perspective and when I went</font>

836
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:46,670
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the OSI model it's like dang</font>

837
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:49,390
there's so many different ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

838
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:51,859
could get on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network if you know and</font>

839
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:53,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so what's important about pen</font>

840
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:56,900
testing and having an internal princess

841
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:59,570
team is a the insider threat are going

842
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:02,010
to take going to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack all</font>

843
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:04,050
these different levels up to like

844
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:07,820
I mean when I was it when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it for</font>

845
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:13,260
me look it was the craziest thing ever

846
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:19,890
in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> subproblem are you doing I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

847
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:22,230
this and put it was ok thanks so I so

848
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:23,580
the crazy thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said when I got the</font>

849
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:25,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">probe me it was the most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> insecure place</font>

850
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:27,690
ever seen in my life it was crazy

851
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,880
because military bases are really really

852
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:33,210
secure and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about before of</font>

853
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:36,090
911 around 1998 when I because like

854
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,970
maybe was so serious about security

855
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:42,060
maybe had some epic security failures

856
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:44,129
you know maybe had some epic like you

857
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,110
know we were turning over we had sailors

858
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:48,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">that were summoned data to Russians and</font>

859
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:50,880
all that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so i was like</font>

860
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:53,070
permanent when I got the fort meade it

861
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,390
was hilarious and I know some of you for

862
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,340
me guys are gonna be watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so I</font>

863
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:59,420
love you guys still but it's a lot

864
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:01,890
tighter now when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I first got there</font>

865
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:05,790
anybody in the world could walk up to

866
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:08,580
port me in walk into NSA lobby and I was

867
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:10,890
like oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> my god right you know you know</font>

868
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:13,590
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> tripped me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up because in the Navy</font>

869
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:15,109
base<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd be shot by Marines</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you maybe</font>

870
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:18,630
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk up to today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the location</font>

871
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:21,840
so uh and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> what warm said so</font>

872
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:25,410
so basically all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I see this</font>

873
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:28,140
cropping up again I think people totally

874
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:32,730
ignore all the physicals of people

875
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:34,620
people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 take there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very big</font>

876
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:36,630
importance when it comes to doing all

877
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:38,400
the lower level stuff up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font>

878
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:42,800
the physical and the data link<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer of</font>

879
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:47,400
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really important because on</font>

880
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:49,770
most pin tests are either all or skewed

881
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,080
one way or the other right there's not

882
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:53,430
much there's typically not any Chinese

883
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:56,310
people that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be doing</font>

884
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:57,240
physical pin tests like they're not

885
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:59,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be walking up to anything</font>

886
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,080
they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything they're fishing</font>

887
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:02,820
they're doing all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

888
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">same time sometimes I think the physical</font>

889
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,860
people did<font color="#E5E5E5"> a physical contest at the big</font>

890
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,540
over-the-top you know

891
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:12,260
what they did you know they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

892
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:13,640
ridiculous stuff right and uh and so

893
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:15,500
there needs to be some kind of balance

894
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:18,170
but i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would say all the physical stuff</font>

895
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">and even on the network stuff your own</font>

896
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,140
in-house people should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing that</font>

897
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:24,380
whether you call on pen testers or not

898
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:27,650
and so they should you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and don't be</font>

899
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:30,140
thinking too dang exotic and you know

900
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:32,810
look for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-hanging fruit do it</font>

901
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:35,270
like I broke into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I put a new lock</font>

902
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:37,940

903
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:39,350

904
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,240

905
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:42,890
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least you know somebody</font>

906
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">could still kick in the door but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

907
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:46,940
least they have to kick in the door or

908
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:49,490

914
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:03,049
