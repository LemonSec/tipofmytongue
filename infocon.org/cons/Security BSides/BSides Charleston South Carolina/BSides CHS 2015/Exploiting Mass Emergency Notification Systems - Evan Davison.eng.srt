1
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,860
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be some interesting</font>

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,420
rambling because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> on like cumulative</font>

3
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:25,369
eight hours of<font color="#CCCCCC"> sleep for the past three</font>

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:27,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">days so if I like freeze for a moment or</font>

5
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:33,320
something like Jared I'll just he knows

6
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:42,260
to throw something<font color="#E5E5E5"> at me so real quick</font>

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:46,180
about me enough of that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

8
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:48,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">throw the the typical stuff in here that</font>

9
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:52,610
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason I do this is because</font>

10
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:58,040
as we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about exploiting</font>

11
00:00:52,610 --> 00:01:01,010
systems that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> designed to keep us</font>

12
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,080
safe and provide information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for</font>

13
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,119
the the reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that these systems</font>

14
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,210
are incredibly awesome things you know

15
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,170
when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tornado warnings and</font>

16
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,309
weather alerts and all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> types of</font>

17
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,720
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes we get a little bit</font>

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,509
annoyed with them but they save lives

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:19,429
and ultimately they're designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font>

20
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:21,470
us safe and so I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of throw this in</font>

21
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:26,840
here and and throw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out because in</font>

22
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:35,090
reality Wow amazingly now I'm getting

23
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:36,740
trolled so fun but the the issues with

24
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,240
these systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> are very egregious and so</font>

25
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,089
some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems were initially</font>

26
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,479
conceived I mean 50 60<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago and</font>

27
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,470
just like IOT and your internet of

28
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,549
things and some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other talks</font>

29
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:51,048
you've heard the what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> value in</font>

30
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:53,570
exploiting them what's the point of

31
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:54,979
sitting here on stage and just blow on

32
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,600
them out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> water and all that type</font>

33
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,220
of stuff it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an issue of showing</font>

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,169
like ooh look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> me I you know I've got</font>

35
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,510
some awesome exporter I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found all these</font>

36
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,630
bad vulnerabilities in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the</font>

37
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:07,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">the motivation to do this after and I'll</font>

38
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">throw this other like for the past two</font>

39
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">years that I've spoken here have been</font>

40
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:12,230
about blue team<font color="#CCCCCC"> and defensive</font>

41
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:14,330
technologies and things like that how do

42
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,579
we improve it and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font>

43
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular talk and the talk that</font>

44
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,920
preceded it then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gave it hacker halted</font>

45
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,569
and a few other conferences that focused

46
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,458
on exploiting the emergency notification

47
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:27,399
system emergency notification systems

48
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:32,200
from the context of

49
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:34,860
RF and radio frequencies and and that

50
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,328
type of stuff these these particular

51
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:41,439
sets of vulnerabilities are really about

52
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:42,939
and I'm already having one of those

53
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,549
moments look what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what was i</font>

54
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:50,769
even going to say yep throw something<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

55
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:53,950
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> woohoo but the point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this was is</font>

56
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:55,450
not to just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know do a little</font>

57
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">root dance or something like that it's</font>

58
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">really to try to motivate the people</font>

59
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,950
that are designing these systems that

60
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,500
are implementing these systems to

61
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,510
understand that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> long lasting</font>

62
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">impact and there is a there's a lot at</font>

63
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,879
stake in this and when I've spoken with

64
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,030
them the earliest disclosures that i did

65
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:15,548
<font color="#CCCCCC">with on vulnerabilities that I had found</font>

66
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:18,639
over five years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> were pretty much the</font>

67
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:21,730
authorities were like so what nobody

68
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">would do that or whatever and we'll talk</font>

69
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,450
about hearing a little bit that

70
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,040
obviously anybody familiar with some of

71
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,379
the exploits of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> system you know</font>

72
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,629
some of the news that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened about</font>

73
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:32,790
this we'll talk about it a little bit so

74
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:36,459
here's a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> background</font>

75
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,810
and I'll provide some there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

76
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:39,489
articles and other things and this is a

77
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,760
link back to the talk that I gave it's

78
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:44,470
called zombies on the airwaves and and

79
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,510
if you hit that under that's kind of a

80
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,430
long thing but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to my blog</font>

81
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,480
pentas valcom you can kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> see some</font>

82
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the links and the other stuff that</font>

83
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,918
precedes this and mainly because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

84
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:55,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">the brevity or the short amount of time</font>

85
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,760
that I have I don't have I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

86
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:59,169
really condense this talk and so that's

87
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,548
part of the reason why it's hard for me

88
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:03,340
to like keep my thoughts together

89
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:04,599
because it's been many years in the

90
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,430
making and and all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> type of stuff</font>

91
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:08,409
but that'll talk a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

92
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,310
it so in preparation for this I wanted

93
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:10,810
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something a little bit interactive</font>

94
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:15,040
and since we've only got like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

95
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:16,120
10 people in the room go do this real

96
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,779
quick i'll leave this up here for a

97
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,280
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted to make something</font>

98
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:26,190
interactive and kind of create our own

99
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,190
little mass notification system and so

100
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:32,710
this took a lot of effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will say we</font>

101
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,840
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more complicated than</font>

102
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:38,409
than I initially had thought it might be

103
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,849
but the intent in this was how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

104
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,370
create something that would that would

105
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,020
simulate how we would inject into the

106
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,720
system because obviously I can't just go

107
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:50,140
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like crack into these</font>

108
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,880
systems and do stupid stuff and you get

109
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,530
alerts on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your phone that you didn't</font>

110
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,480
subscribe to and that type of thing not

111
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,309
saying that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not possible I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

112
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that we're not going to do that</font>

113
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,050
today but for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those that aren't</font>

114
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,340
interested in texting and subscribing to

115
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,930
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> i promise i'm not going to</font>

116
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,060
spam you and that type of deal because

117
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:10,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm paying like per text message to do</font>

118
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,570
this so yeah somebody wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like see</font>

119
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,740
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many thousands of those they can get</font>

120
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,170
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> subscribed or something</font>

121
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,940
before the end of this talk and run my

122
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,470
credit card or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> my wife is in</font>

123
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the back and show thank you a lot for</font>

124
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:29,110
that for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> that don't like nobody's</font>

125
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:32,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that's a first there we go we don't</font>

126
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:34,660
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about your money um I did put up</font>

127
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">some if this then that anybody like if</font>

128
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:40,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">this then that type of thing obviously</font>

129
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,619
if you don't use those then you're not

130
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,610
probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go sign up for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

131
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,500
account real quick or something like

132
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:48,970
that but really cool service<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you'd</font>

133
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to automate things so this is also</font>

134
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,190
part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't get a</font>

135
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,289
whole lot of sleep and why I'm a little

136
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,060
bit frazzled was because even up until a

137
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,730
moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few this happened actually</font>

138
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,350
hours ago the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're using</font>

139
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,810

140
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,090
subscribe<font color="#CCCCCC"> to when I started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> firing some</font>

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,020
this stuff together because this is

143
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,340
there's a lot of jiggery-pokery behind

144
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,799
the scenes to make this this little

145
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing work the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful people that</font>

146
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,000
this group texting deal decided to that

147
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">I might not be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a legitimate person</font>

148
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,070
sending like nuclear explosion warnings

149
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:24,520
and things like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got my account</font>

150
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:28,300
frozen and I may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have come up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

151
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:31,719
workaround but anybody getting the

152
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">subscribed stuff anything I cool</font>

153
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,040
that didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> send anything back all right</font>

154
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:39,890
well well we'll see this may be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

155
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:44,090
massive failure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

156
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:45,950
anticipating that will be but so real

157
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">quick I'm not going to go through this</font>

158
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,940
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for some background for</font>

159
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,320
posterity and for the purposes of having

160
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,030
the slides up so that somebody can go

161
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,130
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look at them later the</font>

162
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,330
emergency<font color="#CCCCCC"> alert</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system kind of has gone</font>

163
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,590
through a bunch of iterations and it's

164
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,599
in the process of going through another

165
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,099
one right now and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> covered this in a</font>

166
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,220
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> detail in the previous talks</font>

167
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,450
but so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in kind of</font>

168
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,980
the history<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff</font>

169
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a lot of resources are posted at the</font>

170
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:13,720
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this love of the talk and in the</font>

171
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:16,400
slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out that I have today but</font>

172
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,380
initially it was radio an AM radio and

173
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,880
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the system was</font>

174
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,370
initially conceived as Conrad and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

175
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:27,290
idea was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to how do i as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the president in</font>

176
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:29,330
the risk of you know nuclear types of

177
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,590
situations if you think back to the you

178
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:35,870
know the Cold War and that type of stuff

179
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:37,159
the intent was to notify the public you

180
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">know that things are going to happen but</font>

181
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,180
more importantly what this system was

182
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:43,850
about was that AM radio stations were

183
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,680
like huge beacons for bombers and

184
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,260
missiles and other things too like hone

185
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,280
in on in major metropolitan areas so

186
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,440
when you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a hundred thousand</font>

187
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,010
watt am station broadcasting they would

188
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,000
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of say like hone in on that</font>

189
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:58,640
broadcasting thing so I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

190
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,260
didn't have gps location at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time or</font>

191
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,539
you know laser dot sights and stuff like

192
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:05,390
that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this system was really intended</font>

193
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,940
to while on the surface was about

194
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:10,580
protecting people it was more about like

195
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:13,219
allowing the presidential you know staff

196
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:16,310
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take over radio stations to scramble</font>

197
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:18,110
signals for purposes of confusing

198
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,280
bombers and things like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

199
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,919
some history on that you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and</font>

200
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">read but it's going through an iteration</font>

201
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,950
now where we see things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

202
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,169
integrated public warning an alert

203
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:28,880
system or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pause I'll talk to you all</font>

204
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:32,960
hear me say I pause because that's a

205
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,549
mouthful and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> wheeze as the videos</font>

206
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,390
on this the videos from FEMA are

207
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:39,978
absolutely hilarious but we's and the

208
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,150
commercial mobile alert system those are

209
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:43,550
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things how you get the AMBER</font>

210
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:46,610
Alerts and such on your cell phone so we

211
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:48,380
go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that too much but obviously we</font>

212
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,029
know the emergency broadcast system

213
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,439
followed this is when they started to

214
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,939
say how do we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for something</font>

215
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,339
other than nuclear holocaust cuz that's

216
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,839
not really is likely anymore and now we

217
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:59,570
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting weather alerts and such on</font>

218
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:01,790
television or radio and the last

219
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,200
iteration of this was the what we call

220
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,660
the emergency alert<font color="#E5E5E5"> system and that's</font>

221
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,230
getting ready to change again<font color="#E5E5E5"> so real</font>

222
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,910
quick some acronyms the in dec is an

223
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:14,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">encode or decode or device and we'll</font>

224
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:17,410
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about those a little bit the big</font>

225
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">other thing common alerting protocol and</font>

226
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,810
actually that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the most</font>

227
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:24,439
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> for now but so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way that</font>

228
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:26,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">this this system worked or works now is</font>

229
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a message</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is seated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into a system</font>

230
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:32,329
and stations listen to other stations

231
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,700
and so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it propagates out into</font>

232
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:36,949
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> United States so anybody play that</font>

233
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,959
old game as a kid telephone you like

234
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,070
whisper a secret and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

235
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">around like if we were to do that what</font>

236
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:45,649
what happens right the message on the

237
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,120
other end anybody you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody in</font>

238
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">the middle likes to you know play a game</font>

239
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">and do things yeah and there are perfect</font>

240
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,020
examples of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're like Maury Povich</font>

241
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,189
is interrupted<font color="#CCCCCC"> by all sorts of crazy</font>

242
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some funny hilarious</font>

243
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,570
videos on YouTube well why did this

244
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:03,110
system ultimately like this is kind of

245
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:08,360
what it looks like these are slides or

246
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:10,490
pictures from FEMA it's it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> friggin</font>

247
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,970
mess is really what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is and so as this</font>

248
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:17,240
system has kind of grown in size<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

249
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:19,250
scale and that type of thing I you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

250
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,440
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even know what this means it's</font>

251
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the craziest thing so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

252
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,180
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the EAS this is kind of a</font>

253
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:28,640
discussion for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> has collect system</font>

254
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,989
and stuff like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they use the</font>

255
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">same series of architectures where</font>

256
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:35,690
people listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people and we'll</font>

257
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,480
see what happens here in a bit there's

258
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:42,350
some some anecdotal evidence of how

259
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,760
successful this stuff is but we can have

260
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,320
some conspiracy theories and stuff like

261
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,430
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the intent of eyeballs and some</font>

262
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,790
of these newer technologies is to

263
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:52,069
actually put the alerts very close and

264
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,439
very targeted to you so down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

265
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,140
particular geographic area for example

266
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,430
like if there's a

267
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,050
letting notification or something like

268
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,400
that they want to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just those</font>

269
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:04,120
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are in that particular area</font>

270
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,590
and so one of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found</font>

271
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,920
kind of funny and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of preparing for</font>

272
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:11,200
this talk was that folly beach has a

273
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,209
notification system and you can go and

274
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,650
subscribe<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it most of these systems</font>

275
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:21,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">are facilitated by government approved</font>

276
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:22,870
third-party commercial companies so like

277
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,930
Code Red that's down there<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the bottom</font>

278
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,430
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just dozens and dozens and</font>

279
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,349
dozens of them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for anything else</font>

280
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,060
what I hope this talk shows you is kind

281
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">of how hilarious this is that I pretty</font>

282
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:36,060
much stood up in a notification system

283
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,160
similar to those<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't say that it's</font>

284
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,290
the same scale or quality or anything

285
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,180
else by any means but in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

286
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:46,959
days was able to stand this up and

287
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:48,310
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a similar function so what does</font>

288
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:53,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">this look like well it looks like this</font>

289
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:54,910
so we've got approved emergency managers

290
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,650
and I say approved because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

291
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,240
going to talk about social engineering

292
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,800
in the context of this because that

293
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,340
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be one way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you might I don't</font>

294
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">know compromise the system is by you</font>

295
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,790
know attacking the people at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that end</font>

296
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,699
but then you've got these I Paul's

297
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,959
message aggregators and then those feed

298
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,340
all of the stuff that's downstream so

299
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,610
your traditional emergency alert system

300
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:17,860
and cellular broadcast digital EAS which

301
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:21,940
is very key to this this this

302
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:23,440
conversation and then I'm this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

303
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,410
reminder to send something so did

304
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,690
everybody register if you don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

305
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:31,770
now I'm going to take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> break for here</font>

306
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,770
just for a second

307
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:53,779
I know you can't see anything but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

308
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,779
going to will go into this in a bid sir

309
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:03,430
yay success

310
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:10,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so where do we begin so the</font>

311
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,170
first place that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of started with</font>

312
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:14,760
this was what is the EES and what are

313
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:17,010
the what comprises it and things like

314
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,210
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I showed this led</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just to show</font>

315
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,770
like there's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of vendors and</font>

316
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,330
providers and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> started by trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

317
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,370
gather some<font color="#E5E5E5"> information about what</font>

318
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:26,550
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> comprise the system and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who is</font>

319
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:28,110
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and and what I found was a lot of</font>

320
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,880
this type of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's hardware right</font>

321
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,590
when I talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet of Things</font>

322
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,350
while all this kind of collides to

323
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:36,540
create a big mishmash of insanity we're

324
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,820
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some crazy stupid</font>

325
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,459
protocols that in bad decisions probably

326
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:44,910
in my and again caveat emptor right this

327
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:46,980
is my opinion solely but<font color="#CCCCCC"> rack-mounted</font>

328
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,300
devices and things like that that many

329
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,610
of these things have been around forever

330
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,050
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I started out with this next</font>

331
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing and I was like well clearly these</font>

332
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:57,079
are very important devices and they

333
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,080
would never be<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet right</font>

334
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:05,010
holy crap it's the USA with chicken pox

335
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:07,140
this was a so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give you some</font>

336
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">practical stuff here so this is I kind</font>

337
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,500
of had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk the boundary of what do I</font>

338
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,709
give you that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can go do if you</font>

339
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">really want to find this stuff and</font>

340
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:18,240
what's just being dumb that is going to

341
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,160
obviously enable somebody to really go

342
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,580
and do something stupid with this with

343
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,980
this information but obviously if it's

344
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:28,530
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet it's not exactly private</font>

345
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:31,410
so i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put out some things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

346
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:33,120
i use to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so a little bit of</font>

347
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,130
shodhan and a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of Google</font>

348
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dorking and a crapload of Google for</font>

349
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,630
purposes of finding documentation and

350
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,610
reading and all that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font>

351
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:45,510
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about this actually the</font>

352
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:47,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide here but so around this</font>

353
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:49,140
time last year before that presentation

354
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:52,170
i gave last year doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the RF stuff</font>

355
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:54,150
there were about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1900 systems almost</font>

356
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">2000 that I found online bit that that's</font>

357
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,860
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that all of those are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> online</font>

358
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,540
anybody that's ever use shodhan anybody

359
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:03,960
audience participation if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't go</font>

360
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,430
use it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome it's a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

361
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,600
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> some different things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

362
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,750
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out there and find</font>

363
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,450
but it's definitely down but that

364
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't mean that that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many systems were</font>

365
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:17,910
really online are really available

366
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:20,070
anyways but one of the things that

367
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:22,589
I was thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> providing to you</font>

368
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,930
guys and I had anybody have those<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

369
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:28,530
in their<font color="#E5E5E5"> lives that are like Evan or you</font>

370
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:33,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">know internally you know that's a bad</font>

371
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:36,000
idea don't do that that know which was

372
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,790
going to be to release a in map script

373
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,740
that would actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> like show you I may</font>

374
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,089
or may not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> created that would</font>

375
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,320
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and test like all the</font>

376
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:47,880
default credentials and things like that

377
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:50,250
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> these because anyways I don't know</font>

378
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,780
why you'd want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that but as it</font>

379
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:55,200
turns out we don't really need to so Oh

380
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:56,370
CentOS and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ascent every time that I</font>

381
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,620
would sit here and start trying to bang

382
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:01,950
on something technically I would find

383
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:03,660
stuff and then we're going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

384
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:07,740
a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a sidebar here or you</font>

385
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:09,660
know through this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the advance</font>

386
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,010
so I start going<font color="#CCCCCC"> around I'm like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

387
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,050
right we'll see what I can find some of

388
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,819
these devices and sure enough wow

389
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:18,089
there's they've got them on ebay and

390
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,500
some of the things like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

391
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:22,170
to let me do it but like serial number

392
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,500
and mac address and all that type of

393
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:29,490
stuff that that may be like useful in

394
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,620
certain scenarios and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

395
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,200
draw too much into that but but

396
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,420
obviously this might not be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> great</font>

397
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,340
thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> these critical devices that</font>

398
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:42,329
you know are allowed to retrieve

399
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:44,010
messages and other things from the

400
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:47,580
United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> government or whoever it</font>

401
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:49,920
may be to alert us of what's been going

402
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:52,410
on or emergencies that are in our area

403
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,610
that are pertinent to us but and so then

404
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,170
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to do some additional stuff and</font>

405
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,050
I find these articles like I pause

406
00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:00,150
potentially hasn't been exploited well

407
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,920
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's too small for you to read</font>

408
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">but here I'm thinking oh yeah somebody's</font>

409
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,619
a security article somebody's talking

410
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">about something know what this guy's</font>

411
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,560
talking about is he's there with this

412
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:10,139
emergency management group and they're

413
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:13,950
like man the potential of this thing is

414
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,940
yet to be exploited like oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but</font>

415
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,980
then he starts to talk about like

416
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,690
digital sign systems highway departments

417
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,670
with big signs<font color="#E5E5E5"> could pick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up I pause</font>

418
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:24,180
alerts for their area and put them on

419
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:25,660
campuses and other things and so

420
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is interest</font>

421
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,250
then I start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find stuff about how</font>

422
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:32,850
fragile the EAS system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these</font>

423
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:36,190
devices are with stuff like this where

424
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:39,159
the FCC find a company<font color="#CCCCCC"> two million</font>

425
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:41,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">dollars because they put an EAS message</font>

426
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,570
inside of this movie trailer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

427
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:48,459
triggered equipment all over the United

428
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:52,330
States let me think about this for a

429
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,040
second so spoiler alert if you go see

430
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,710
the other talk on RF that may be exactly

431
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,080
what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about which is like taking</font>

432
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:01,570
pre-recorded messages or maybe android

433
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,149
apps that help you make joke you know

434
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:05,500
prank your friends with this you know

435
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,170
funny app that you can buy on the

436
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">android app store for like three dollars</font>

437
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:12,760
that will actually trigger these devices

438
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,710
and trigger these systems and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font>

439
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i bought that thing on on</font>

440
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:20,250
ebay but i may have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of these</font>

441
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:23,320
devices which are not illegal to own

442
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:25,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you can buy them yourself if you</font>

443
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:29,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to spend like five thousand dollars</font>

444
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:32,770
um so there we go i did that<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

445
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,330
fail so then i start trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

446
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,920
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i go out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the vendors and</font>

447
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,179
things like that I've got all these list

448
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,170
of vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go to their websites i'm</font>

449
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,580
like i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> download some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

450
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,860
software i'm going to download documents

451
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:44,020
and manuals obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> o sent right</font>

452
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,100
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> following my progression of</font>

453
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,180
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm doing i'm just trying to get</font>

454
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,580
information what are these how these

455
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:50,170
things work and so then I start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

456
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,360
stuff we're obviously now that they've

457
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">been there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have been some incidents and</font>

458
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,780
some accidents and that type of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

459
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,850
started to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on how</font>

460
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,790
they're no longer just putting this out

461
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:02,290
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

462
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">and download stuff they want you to be a</font>

463
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:06,460
legitimate person that you have to have

464
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:08,409
some type of pre approval to get

465
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,570
firmware updates or whatever kind of

466
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,130
typical things right not that they would

467
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,080
do a whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> good if you had them</font>

468
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,910
anyways other than for maybe some of the

469
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,189
stuff that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

470
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:21,160
bit that make it a little easier but

471
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:24,670
then they're not exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the brightest</font>

472
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:30,070
bulbs in the lamp or I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know insert</font>

473
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:32,110
terrible euphemism but just by google

474
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,879
searching i'm finding based on these

475
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:36,459
vendors this these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the passwords to</font>

476
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,260
the encrypted or whatever zip files that

477
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,250
they're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth so these are</font>

478
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,120
out on

479
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:46,420
knew that listservs were still like such

480
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,729
valuable sources of information right so

481
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:51,610
obviously this is awesome well then I

482
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:53,530
find fun stuff like this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of</font>

483
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:56,050
those and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i allude to this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> luda this a</font>

484
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:58,330
moment ago maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> just attacking the</font>

485
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,800
people that are the responsible people

486
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,350
that can release the alerts in the first

487
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,510
place who may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be and what what's hard to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">con only I hit the wrong reply button</font>

internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> for posterity or we can go into</font>

496
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">the forums where we find these engineers</font>

497
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,870
who are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand they</font>

498
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,520
understand radio and other things really

499
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,770
well but trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand how</font>

500
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,629
computers and networking work is very

501
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:40,600
hard and so they're trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

new I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paul's devices that once were not</font>

504
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,790
they've received it over the air from

505
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">other radio stations now they're getting</font>

506
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,700
it over the internet and they're trying

507
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,669
to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to put pin holes in</font>

508

have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice enough to you know post</font>

511
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,470
can drop in there and have<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun with</font>

512
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,899
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys if you like to troll them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

513
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:06,250
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I ran into this this deal so</font>

514
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,130
I'm starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find like okay here's</font>

515
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,230
here's the links to get information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

516
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,270
started was like well how do I get or

517
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,520
how do i connect to FEMA if I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

518
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,870
see like to interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this these</font>

519
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,580
message services and things like that

520
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:21,340
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> do i interact with them and so I</font>

521
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,949
start to find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't just it's</font>

522
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:32,949
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though it's a very complicated</font>

523
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:37,590
technology a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cutting-edge RSS RSS right</font>

524
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:43,110
um yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this brand new I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Paul system</font>

525
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:43,110
state-of-the-art<font color="#E5E5E5"> cutting-edge RSS</font>

526
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,420
I'm gonna let that sink in for a second

527
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,980
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

528
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:54,830
stop here for a second what we'll do a

529
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">quick little hopefully a demo</font>

530
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:04,670
what letting you see something<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

531
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:09,140
so we saw so I'm sitting here I'm like

532
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:11,590
all right well I want to connect to its

533
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,590
going to do that

534
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:23,570
so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connect up to stuff and</font>

535
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:24,799
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard but I want to</font>

536
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,090
connect up but i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see like what</font>

537
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,580
these feeds are what these alerts are

538
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:31,309
coming out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fema so I that's kind of</font>

539
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:34,689
tiny and so I find the URLs finding the

540
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:37,399
URLs to this stuff is no problem right

541
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:40,580
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> every time I try to connect to it I</font>

542
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:41,719
get this invalid pin stuff and so the

543
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,939
previous search that I showed you that

544
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,090
was a fail obviously I know it's RSS I

545
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:50,149
know it's you know the basic stuff and

546
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:53,918
I'm skipping over a lot of research here

547
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:56,149
but are you still<font color="#E5E5E5"> following me ok so i</font>

548
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:59,059
find the feed and that type of thing and

549
00:22:56,149 --> 00:23:01,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">i want to connect up and get alerts and</font>

550
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:03,049
see how these things you how were they

551
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,059
releasing what all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of goodies does</font>

552
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:07,940
does fema not want me to see clearly

553
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:11,928
because when i try to go to it i get i

554
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:14,600
get this you know invalid pin so I start

555
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:17,869
googling for pen right and lo and behold

556
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:20,379
uh you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I find these magical numbers</font>

557
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:23,928
that apparently belong to each vendor

558
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:31,389
that are apparently also embedded in the

559
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:31,389
firmware<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just keep moving on</font>

560
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,710
so then I start laying in the Sun like

561
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:46,250
obviously this is not a very well

562
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:47,570
designed type of thing here but um you

563
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,250
know I start reading the I'm like

564
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,960
certain somebody had to do somebody

565
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,220
somewhere had to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this so I</font>

566
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a guy in here</font>

567
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,820
earlier was talking about Carnegie

568
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,649
Mellon and this whole thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that came to</font>

569
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,178
light this week obviously the you know

570
00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:01,820
where they got paid by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eff who was</font>

571
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:03,260
FBI or somebody million dollars river I

572
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,379
don't know I'm not anybody know what I'm

573
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:07,519
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about all right google it i</font>

574
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,960
guess i<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

575
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,630
much about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just have seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> headlines</font>

576
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,210
and made me laugh because in the context

577
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:17,120
of this so guess who did the assessment

578
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:19,370
risk you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the assessment of risk and</font>

579
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,739
strategy and security architecture for

580
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:26,899
this entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing the wonderful people</font>

581
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:30,860
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> carnegie mellon university I've read</font>

582
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:34,158
it and other than putting me to sleep a

583
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:37,519
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times the amazing lack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

584
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:41,210
substance in the context that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire</font>

585
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:44,090
idea was that somebody attacking the

586
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:47,149
FEMA system itself so<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacking I pause</font>

587
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:49,100
as an RSS server so they put it behind

588
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:50,059
Akamai and they put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it behind all these</font>

589
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,529
things they've got this great

590
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:54,139
architecture of how you can't take it

591
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:58,370
down and blah blah blah blah but yet

592
00:24:54,139 --> 00:25:00,289
nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> really thought about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and</font>

593
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:03,500
we'll see this here in a moment there's

594
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:04,850
some major missing things in that you

595
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">know like wait a minute all I'm going to</font>

596
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:09,559
do is attack FEMA<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just saw</font>

597
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,929
a moment ago like obviously the US with

598
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:14,570
chicken pox anybody I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like</font>

599
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:15,919
throw that link back you know us with

600
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,600
chicken pox well maybe there's some

601
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,070
devices out there that are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

602
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,908
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so maybe we can talk to</font>

603
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:25,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">those but so then I find also from our</font>

604
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:29,149
friends at Carnegie Mellon this awesome

605
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:33,980
github repo full of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is it's a web</font>

606
00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:35,719
client for simple cap authoring the then

607
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:39,200
I see calculator server to authenticate

608
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:43,010
sign aggregate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ford cap alerts that</font>

609
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:46,250
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fun so I'm going to take us</font>

610
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:47,389
back to this diagram so we've got the

611
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,549
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> up there that we've seen</font>

612
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:51,330
obviously probably aren't necessarily

613
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:55,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">the greatest with</font>

614
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:58,080
I don't know you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

615
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:00,690
operations or are keeping their their

616
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,550
passwords even off of email lists and so

617
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,740
forth that go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to the world and then</font>

618
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:07,620
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next piece of this is this security</font>

619
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,970
around this I pause system that you know

620
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,510
that Carnegie Mellon did<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font>

621
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:14,940
obviously very secure so I probably

622
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:17,640
ought to leave that alone<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saw</font>

623
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,140
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait a minute I have this so maybe</font>

624
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then I I know where all those</font>

625
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,080
devices are that they're out there on

626
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:26,190
the internet and I have this so maybe I

627
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,139
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make this myself and and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so then we</font>

628
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:30,510
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just keep going so I kind of keep</font>

629
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,310
finding some research and so we talked

630
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:34,379
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier previous exploits on the</font>

631
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:36,360
system anybody hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the zombies on</font>

632
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,670
the you know in Montana or whatever that

633
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,419
took over morning radio show this is

634
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:44,760
back in 2013 anybody hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

635
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:47,820
nobody so pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much what happened was</font>

636
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:50,100
is that early one morning television

637
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,290
show or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV station in Montana gets say</font>

638
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,899
somebody apparently breaks in using

639
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:56,580
these keys and so forth and then later

640
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,670
it came that came out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it wasn't</font>

641
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:01,110
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> these ssh-keys it was the they</font>

642
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:04,650
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> not changed the default credentials</font>

643
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:06,149
on the on the appliance and so somebody

644
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,430
got in there and released a funny

645
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:09,810
message that then propagated a bit and

646
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:12,090
went out on television stations and so

647
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:14,399
forth and so shortly after I mean this

648
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:16,919
got articles in Wired magazine and all

649
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,720
this other type of stuff and I'm just

650
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:21,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to call bull crap because that</font>

651
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,280
really yes I have validated that that

652
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,479
vulnerability exists in that version of

653
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,930
the firmware release and things like

654
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,600
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but there are so many more awful</font>

655
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:33,420
things that would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been way easier</font>

656
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,709
to do so I kind of take this unlike

657
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,690
obviously this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a fun one to get</font>

658
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">into right this daz</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dak appliance or</font>

659
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,570
whatever that's part of this particular

660
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,520
set of vulnerabilities that I elected

661
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:44,310
found and so I start<font color="#CCCCCC"> going out there and</font>

662
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">I until I said earlier you know they</font>

663
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:48,300
they started locking the stuff up right

664
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:50,310
you had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have passwords to get to the</font>

665
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,620
firmwares and other things and so then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

666
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:55,679
find a PDF online from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company that</font>

667
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:57,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">just released this that maybe has the</font>

668
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:00,260
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I blurred out there that</font>

669
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:02,640
you can download<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the firmware and</font>

670
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:04,740
yes this does still work so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what</font>

671
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,660
I've learned it out

672
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,760
not that you can't go and<font color="#CCCCCC"> find it but</font>

673
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,830
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is my opinion that this</font>

674
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,540
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> failing and then I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also had some</font>

675
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,919
firmware from and some configuration

676
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,830
utilities from some of the other vendors

677
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">that made it possible to like wait a</font>

678
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:21,540
minute what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this except bad signature</font>

679
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,428
why would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put that in there right</font>

680
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:26,340
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> only going to talk to FEMA right</font>

681
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:27,870
maybe verify signature oh I can uncheck

682
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,809
that not that never mind it wasn't

683
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:32,850
checked by default anyways require a

684
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:35,010
signature evening I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn all this</font>

685
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:38,100
stuff off these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> features right no</font>

686
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:43,410
ssl check and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can configure my</font>

687
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:49,939
own so let's do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is anybody received</font>

688
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:53,240
any notifications yet no wow this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

689
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,240
going to suck

690
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:59,030
alright so this real quick so i'm going

691
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show you what I went over here and</font>

692
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,629
did a moment ago

693
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:19,809
so that that wonderful software that we

694
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:21,340
talked about a little bit ago that the

695
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:24,009
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> from Carnegie Mellon were so nice</font>

696
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:26,860
to to provide to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us I may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have stood</font>

697
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:28,809
that up and that may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be something that</font>

698
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,610
you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and interact with and as I</font>

699
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:32,139
mentioned before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people at Carnegie</font>

700
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:34,988
Mellon are really great about telling us

701
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:38,258
that we made this and you know that this

702
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:39,779
is open source and so forth so yeah you

703
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:42,789
can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and play</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this if you want to</font>

704
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:46,109
Django server I<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely learn to hate</font>

705
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:50,350
it with using this because it sucks but

706
00:29:46,109 --> 00:29:53,918
again my opinion and then i can create

707
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:55,779
things like this you know RSS feeds that

708
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,970
our cap compliant and so forth so let's

709
00:29:55,779 --> 00:30:00,399
look at what it how difficult it is with

710
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:03,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">this software now to create a message I</font>

711
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,168
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to issue a new alert and you know</font>

712
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:08,049
of all the things i can say is this

713
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:14,080
actual is it a test make that a little

714
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:18,570
bigger<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now is this an</font>

715
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:21,730
actual alert what is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

716
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:23,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that this is actual you</font>

717
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">know who I want to release</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to private</font>

718
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,039
public restricted so all this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of</font>

719
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:29,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> standard that was created around</font>

720
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,908
these emergency notifications and you

721
00:30:29,139 --> 00:30:34,168
can go in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and create all sorts of nifty</font>

722
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:37,749
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to save us some time and</font>

723
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:40,090
i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> just create another one here that</font>

724
00:30:37,749 --> 00:30:42,159
you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I you can make templates</font>

725
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:45,730
and so forth and do all sorts of fun

726
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:48,519
things hazard threat make preparations

727
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:51,549
to whatever how long<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font>

728
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:53,799
last then you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do things like</font>

729
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:56,049
who's issuing this alert obviously this

730
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:58,690
is very difficult to put text in a box

731
00:30:56,049 --> 00:31:01,149
right anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I lose you already i</font>

732
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,470
know that it's the afternoon and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not</font>

733
00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:07,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">really making a whole lot of sense at</font>

734
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:14,140
this point anyways it's fine all right

735
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:21,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right I'm dragging this out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we</font>

736
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:24,430
hate you Evan so anyways other yeah yeah

737
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:26,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeahs alert pin Ches fail calm you are</font>

738
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:28,390
more than welcome to go there and so

739
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,500
then this is kind of a fun thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

740
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:32,340
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to zoom this out just a little bit</font>

741
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:36,040
so it's easier to kind of interact with

742
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:37,990
is they provide this mechanism so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

743
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,510
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> before that the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> behind</font>

744
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:46,330
the system is to create geolocation

745
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:48,160
you're very specific targeted alerts

746
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,659
that that can be released<font color="#E5E5E5"> by local</font>

747
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,210
authorities<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth and so the idea</font>

748
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:54,670
with this system<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is that they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can you</font>

749
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:57,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">know a county or city or even that level</font>

750
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:59,470
can issue alerts that just go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their</font>

751
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:04,080
their particular area of authorization

752
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:05,920
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know in that context</font>

753
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">geo-information becomes kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

754
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,610
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some of these alerts and so</font>

755
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:12,940
their utility had to create you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

756
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:16,449
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very complicated you know who</font>

757
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:18,910
receives this alert everybody let's just

758
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:20,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">send it to the whole friggin world if I</font>

759
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:23,530
wanted to because what ends up happening

760
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,760
is is that as systems receive this the

761
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:27,310
idea behind the system is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

762
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">much everybody receives the alerts okay</font>

763
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:31,149
so every system receives it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and based on</font>

764
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,310
codes and other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are in it</font>

765
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:35,200
that are either you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what type of</font>

766
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:37,389
message it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and other things they're</font>

767
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,820
programmed what to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you know</font>

768
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:42,760
if it's an alert for Alabama and I'm an

769
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:44,200
EAS system<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting in Georgia I don't</font>

770
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">care about it so I'm not going to replay</font>

771
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,010
it but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the configuration</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

772
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:49,750
it's in those gooeys and other things

773
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:51,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I showed you you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very briefly</font>

774
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,900
earlier I talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

775
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,310
little bit more the previous talk I

776
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,080
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time to dig into</font>

777
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:59,620
it and talk and show some of the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

778
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,909
this but because I'm running short on

779
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:05,080
time already but the idea is that

780
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:06,640
everybody would receive this they would

781
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,520
filter it out based on their policy and

782
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:14,160
so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that to ramp it for Miss</font>

783
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:19,590
configuration and so whatever

784
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:21,390
oh so I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a I can even</font>

785
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:23,100
do multiple areas and so forth I didn't

786
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:24,780
realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that learn something new every</font>

787
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:28,949
time so then it gives me the output of

788
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:30,360
this who don't they'll be hopeful maybe

789
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:38,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll stop stuttering or something</font>

790
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:39,780
clearly I have a problem so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

791
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,690
it looks like and so like say this is uh

792
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,830
I didn't talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this much just</font>

793
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:46,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">because I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really think it's that</font>

794
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:49,830
important but is anybody familiar with

795
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:52,710
oasis there I want to kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like yeah</font>

796
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:54,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">I ETF and a manner of speakin same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

797
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:56,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">allat of different standards and things</font>

798
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,370
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they're responsible for</font>

799
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">this protocol and and the fields and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

800
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,790
format and other things so this is a

801
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,240
regulated type of thing so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

802
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:09,380
know that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will work everywhere and</font>

803
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:12,150
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea behind this is that you have to</font>

804
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:14,490
digitally sign these messages and so

805
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:16,350
forth that whoever's releasing them is

806
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:22,469
approved and I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

807
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:25,710
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> small so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to release an</font>

808
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:27,959
alert and so we see this you know valeu

809
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:30,260
I don't know what I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> did but sorry</font>

810
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,699
guys it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> or less what it said was</font>

811
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:35,790
that yes your credentials are correct

812
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:38,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's signed it's authenticated so on and</font>

813
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:40,500
so forth and so that's where that stuff

814
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,720
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system came back from like trust</font>

815
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:46,050
the you know digitally and that's where

816
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:49,469
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FEMA and Carnegie Mellon they have</font>

817
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:51,270
in the base context and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how they</font>

818
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:53,939
built the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is that</font>

819
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:55,800
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a validation on these</font>

820
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,950
signatures like who signed that message

821
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:02,070
who created it and do I trust that and

822
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:03,240
so fourth well clearly in this instance

823
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,830
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have to worry about that</font>

824
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I'm standing up my own I'm not</font>

825
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:11,310
pretending to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be FEMA at this point I'm</font>

826
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:13,050
alert pen test fail calm and it may or

827
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,370
may not be trivial to go and find some

828
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:16,200
of those devices and just add those

829
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:18,020
configurations to them I know I'm kind

830
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,089
of skipping around here a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit but</font>

831
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:23,190
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a good flow like</font>

832
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:25,740
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> it didn't come in one solid</font>

833
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:27,270
stream of stuff right this was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

834
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:30,330
research over a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time</font>

835
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:33,480
but but now I've released another alert

836
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:35,490
and I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this feed gets updated</font>

837
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,320
well the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those systems and all</font>

838
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:39,540
the other devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> work as they pull this</font>

839
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,950
RSS feed at an interval and once they

840
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:43,110
get it they pull the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information and</font>

841
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:44,460
they decide what to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it based</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

842
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:48,240
their configuration and they release the

843
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,890
alert or not well like I said now I've

844
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,810
got my own I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paul server that Carnegie</font>

845
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:55,529
Mellon was so nice to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me for</font>

846
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:57,029
free<font color="#E5E5E5"> even under a bsd license and now i</font>

847
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,440
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> or may not be able to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

848
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,940
fingerprint those devices which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you now</font>

849
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,090
have some of the stuff that shows how

850
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:05,310
you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and find them and if you're</font>

851
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:06,540
creative you may try some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the default</font>

852
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:10,799
credentials for some of these and

853
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:13,950
probably get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them i'm</font>

854
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,500
going to say exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many not going</font>

855
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:20,520
to say that that even happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> what am I</font>

856
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:25,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about clearly I'm delirious but</font>

857
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:25,759
so let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

858
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,580
yes I

859
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:39,880
so uh make sure I didn't skip over

860
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:46,329
something here

861
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:48,369
ah i didn't i didn't whatever see<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

862
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,960
gonna have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> extra minutes so i'm</font>

863
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:51,190
gonna kind of skipped over something

864
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,269
because i don't know how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> time i was</font>

865
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:55,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have if i could dig into this</font>

866
00:36:52,269 --> 00:36:58,419
or not but some of the research I we're

867
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:59,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">about to dig into in a moment was not</font>

868
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,779
possible would<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be possible with not</font>

869
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,569
for Tom who had to leave a bit ago he

870
00:37:01,779 --> 00:37:08,529
was he was here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and wasn't able to stay</font>

871
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:11,440
but also my buddy James both of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

872
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:14,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of my couple of mentors that helped</font>

873
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,750
me a lot so things like anybody know

874
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:19,118
what a LexA graphical or Lex analyzer is

875
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:22,690
or like Lex code things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

876
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:25,119
some of these yeah go ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> your elders</font>

877
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:26,980
because I had to do the same thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

878
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,769
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that an insulting way that's</font>

879
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:32,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just things that we don't</font>

880
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:36,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the concept of taking machine</font>

881
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:38,799
based code and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know anyways go</font>

882
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,029
go google it it'll love you'll see it

883
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:42,460
he'll blow your mind the idea of like

884
00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:44,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">multistage compiling anybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

885
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:48,309
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what Lex is it's a stage</font>

886
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:49,930
in compiling code and anyways that's

887
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:51,609
about where my level of knowledge stops

888
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:52,690
so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reverse-engineer some of the</font>

889
00:37:51,609 --> 00:37:54,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">firmware and some of the utilities and</font>

890
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:57,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">other things that I found I then had to</font>

891
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,559
rely on some of my mentors to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

892
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:03,700
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> me reverse engineer it so that we</font>

893
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:04,809
can show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you some of the stuff that</font>

894
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,529
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you here in a second</font>

895
00:38:04,809 --> 00:38:10,089
so with that being said I puts I've got

896
00:38:07,529 --> 00:38:12,150
more links and references in here than

897
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:14,680
I've ever had any other talk because

898
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:16,599
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just tons and tons and tons of</font>

899
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,710
resources and tons and tons and tons of

900
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:22,059
information that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> available to this and</font>

901
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,589
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw this this last slide</font>

902
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:26,230
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and then what I'll do is I'll</font>

903
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:28,150
I'm going to stop the recording once

904
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:30,400
unless we have any questions or anything

905
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:32,769
real quick but i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you so</font>

906
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,390
all of that effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and all you can</font>

907
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:38,828
keep it going for just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a second but all</font>

908
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:39,970
that effort that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not went into now</font>

909
00:38:38,829 --> 00:38:42,220
that we've stood up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system and now</font>

910
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:43,299
that we've fingerprinted them and we

911
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,769
know where they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that type of</font>

912
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:47,500
thing what are some other mechanisms

913
00:38:44,769 --> 00:38:48,819
that we could use to potentially control

914
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,079
them so we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are</font>

915
00:38:48,819 --> 00:38:51,450
vulnerabilities that there have been

916
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,180
patches for them there's

917
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:56,330
us-cert releases and things like that

918
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,770
from the Dazz deck from the ioactive

919
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:00,390
vulnerabilities that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found but</font>

920
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:02,490
there may or may not be like a few

921
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:04,770
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> others that could potentially be</font>

922
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:12,089
exploited which i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to video</font>

923
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:13,860
or talk about in that context but any

924
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:15,300
questions I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this hasn't made a</font>

925
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,620
whole lot of sense and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

926
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:20,490
one of the crappiest talks were given

927
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:29,549
but i'm not i'm not exactly impressed by

928
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:30,779
any means so yeah that would ya yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

929
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:40,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be like that kid you know with</font>

930
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:43,770
the golf ball retriever you um so the

931
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:45,180
thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like because of how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

932
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:48,509
retrieve it there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a way to</font>

933
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:50,910
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say that the majority</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

934
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:54,150
people are not most of its commercial so

935
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:55,319
most of the stuff that's out there and

936
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:57,330
the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess for video</font>

937
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,340
purposes was are a lot of people using

938
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:01,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">the card email and software and I think</font>

939
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,730
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason was that that Carnegie Mellon</font>

940
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,350
counter was tasked or<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked to write it</font>

941
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:05,340
or something like that was that most of

942
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:07,980
the systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> were really expensive</font>

943
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:10,530
because I looked at just subscribing to

944
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:12,240
one of them and you know making my own

945
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:14,010
campus area alert system or something

946
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> push things out to</font>

947
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:19,380
televisions and all this other type of

948
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,690
stuff and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality was is that but</font>

949
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,220
hey I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it in the time frame</font>

950
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:26,100
because they have all sorts of approval

951
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:28,500
processes that and like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the</font>

952
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:30,210
setup fees for them are insanely

953
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,730
expensive these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not inexpensive</font>

954
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:35,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">things so like the Code</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Red deal that</font>

955
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:37,560
folly beach has and stuff like that

956
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:39,089
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do so most of the</font>

957
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,810
system is just like it's based on the

958
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:44,580
idea that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do all of the</font>

959
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:46,980
vetting up front that you have to be a

960
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:48,330
vetted person that you can't just

961
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,290
release these alerts or that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

962
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:52,200
that are important art going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

963
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:54,660
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was hoping to demonstrate</font>

964
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,730
was that so what most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those people</font>

965
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">are idiots anyways they don't know about</font>

966
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:00,300
security I'm sorry I'm definitely gonna

967
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,980
have to edit the video now because I'm

968
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,200
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get trolled on this like I let</font>

969
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">them just call those people stupid but</font>

970
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,720
yeah when

971
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,220
you I mean any it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even about being</font>

972
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,069
stupid<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's about any number of mistakes</font>

973
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:12,779
that get made that I accidentally reply

974
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:14,970
to all with a password<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something like</font>

975
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:18,240
that that then goes out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and gets shared</font>

976
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:20,368
and can be found and used and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

977
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,919
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> from reality that that's not very</font>

978
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:24,570

from like Reese or like where they were

980
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:30,390
doing working groups to determine how

they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and organized you</font>

management divisions and who's in charge

987
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:42,270
of it who's this you got their emails

988
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,740
and their phone numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and their</font>

989
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:45,600
addresses and all this stuff because

990
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:47,640
these are all government documents so it

991
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,170
may or may not be fairly trivial to you

992
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,490
know I now have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire list of</font>

people that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start sending</font>

00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:56,160
phishing emails to for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font>

995
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:59,460
reality is is that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not a</font>

996
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,960
very sound strategy and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> never mind</font>

997
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:04,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fact that the system itself isn't</font>

particularly well architected<font color="#CCCCCC"> too well</font>

999
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,520
it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very resilient for emergency</font>

1000
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:12,540
purposes it's definitely not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very secure</font>

1001
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:18,390
from a from a technology standpoint and

so on that any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other questions death</font>
