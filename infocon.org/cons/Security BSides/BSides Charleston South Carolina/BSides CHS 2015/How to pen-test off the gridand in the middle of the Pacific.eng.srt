1
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:21,150
alright cool so<font color="#CCCCCC"> take to some server</font>

2
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dave's we're talking about pentesting</font>

3
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,759
off the grid<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the Middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Pacific it's</font>

4
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:30,750
just some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my experiences living in</font>

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,170
Hawaii on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> father's farm with</font>

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,150
literally no running water sewage

7
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:38,160
electricity any of those things and how

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,690
it really applies to us like if you're

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,459
doing penetration testing or any type of

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:47,040
testing at all like how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:49,350
do this with very limited resources like

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,769
I mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> before 14 year old Dave can</font>

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:01:07,650
tell you a little bit about Who I am not

14
00:00:52,769 --> 00:01:11,610
big on bios know if you can hear that

15
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:14,700
but my alias is gatekeeper when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was 14</font>

16
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:18,240
and I'm an anarchist it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

17
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:26,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">about me this is actually building</font>

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:27,149
explosives in my mom's basement so so

19
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,000
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about a little bit how I</font>

20
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,220
came to live off the grid what my live

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">set up really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of looked like and</font>

22
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,560
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools and techniques I used for it</font>

23
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,410
making sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> our testing my testing was</font>

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,600
accurate and then also talk a little bit

25
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,310
about how to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> sustainable from living</font>

26
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a foreign living and working from a</font>

27
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:52,560
foreign country so I got some pictures

28
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:57,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it was a real working farm my dad's</font>

29
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,890
farm in Hawaii<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh god can't see him</font>

30
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,419
so picture time as I didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

31
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,270
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do actual technical talk so you're</font>

32
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:17,220
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at pictures instead so</font>

33
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:20,250
Hawaii is very unique place<font color="#CCCCCC"> to live we</font>

34
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,080
grew a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things amazingly</font>

35
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,300
you find in a restaurants what you can't

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,760
get on the mainland are being shipped

37
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,310
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mainland over to Hawaii becomes</font>

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,530
a really good crop beats in this

39
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,120
particular case we grew beats<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

40
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,050
restaurants they use it in coloring for

41
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,670
different ice creams and they use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

42
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:42,000
pretty much across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> island now that</font>

43
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,679
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been introduced to Hawaii Tomatoes</font>

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,500
do not grow in Hawaii for the most part

45
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,140
lesser that size of a specific insect so

46
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,959
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 599 for tomatoes per</font>

47
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,089
pound in Hawaii so that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a</font>

48
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">good crop to have and we had this in a</font>

49
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:00,180
an enclosure that would keep that insect

50
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:03,270
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> mangoes I would make mango chutney</font>

51
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,150
pin and put it in jars and we go sell it

52
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:09,450
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> market lots of different herbs</font>

53
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,769
and herbs and things like that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

54
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,970
pretty much could throw anything out in

55
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:17,670
the ground in Hawaii and it will grow

56
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:19,859
aquaponics I got aquaponics setup and

57
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:23,458
running to do lettuce it's much easier

58
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do lettuce and things like that an</font>

59
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,950
aquaponics setup really fast we're

60
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:31,350
looking at that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably only a day's</font>

61
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:34,200
maybe day and a half work growth and you

62
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:40,260
can have a harvest every week before

63
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:43,410
farmers market hunting what<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

64
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:46,078
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't realize this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hawaii is a is a</font>

65
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:49,260
sport hunting ground there's introduced

66
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:52,260
the wild pigs and deer and things like

67
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:56,100
that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can actually hunt all those</font>

68
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:58,890
things especially up on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> farm that</font>

69
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,230
was the view from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the deck that's Pearl</font>

70
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:03,208
Harbor and Honolulu in the background

71
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,090
there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the view from from the</font>

72
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:09,180
farm that's the view<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the road going</font>

73
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,879
up so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> farm house is right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here with</font>

74
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,790
where the cursor is and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all</font>

75
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,820
national forest behind there

76
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,259
my range<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you're pretty much able to</font>

77
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,959
hike and camp and do whatever you need

78
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:24,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">to back there it was an amazing place to</font>

79
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">live now is the that's the farmhouse an</font>

80
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:29,120
interesting part about living on this

81
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,710
farm is these rocks were pretty much

82
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,120
everywhere and you see there's nothing

83
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,520
built next to them that's because they

84
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,729
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hawaiian hieroglyphs this area was</font>

85
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:40,460
actually part of the domani pineapple

86
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:42,740
plantation and they found these Hawaiian

87
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,989
hieroglyphs on these rocks in the

88
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,310
Hawaiian Historical Society basically if

89
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,870
you find that on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your property you're</font>

90
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,199
not able to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything within a quarter</font>

91
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,820
mile and then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> allow people</font>

92
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:58,699
to be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up and study those</font>

93
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:59,900
those ruins and then a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of peacocks</font>

94
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,630
everywhere I don't know fever hurt

95
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,030
peacocks before they're pretty annoying

96
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:07,550
and then chickens there's chickens

97
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:11,030
everywhere on the islands one part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

98
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,729
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> farm they do cockfighting I mean</font>

99
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:17,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously that's illegal but you'd have</font>

100
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:19,610
anywhere from 1000 to 1500 roosters and

101
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:23,750
hens<font color="#CCCCCC"> which you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine that noise up</font>

102
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:26,270
there but sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> working conditions</font>

103
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:29,419
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be nicer go to Waikiki Beach and</font>

104
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:31,430
I'm using the similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotspot there to</font>

105
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:32,510
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some testing that day I just didn't</font>

106
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,310
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like being at the farm and</font>

107
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:38,150
anything's portable pretty much in

108
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:40,669
Hawaii fishing was the order<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day</font>

109
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:45,198
so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into my schedule a little</font>

110
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:46,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit later on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but feel like ahi tuna get</font>

111
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,400
down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beach about one or two</font>

112
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">o'clock in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the afternoon and dive in and</font>

113
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:55,039
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have you know fresh</font>

114
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:59,139
fish every single night so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

115
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,139
few pictures<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway show and tell</font>

116
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:14,090
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically my lab is very simple there</font>

117
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:16,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">Honda EU generators if you ever think of</font>

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,090
wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in a condition off the</font>

119
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,370
grid and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you wanted something pretty</font>

120
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,780
quiet where you could still have

121
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:24,750
business meetings it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quiet</font>

122
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:27,270
generator very efficient and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> UPS to</font>

123
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,640
back everything up now in Hawaii up

124
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:33,270
until just<font color="#CCCCCC"> recently had one of the best</font>

125
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:35,219
implementations of wimax so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

126
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,330
actually able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seven Meg now</font>

127
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,880
that doesn't sound like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot but</font>

128
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:41,150
compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to most other internet</font>

129
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,610
connections on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the island that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was very</font>

130
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:46,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">very quick so I had it directional yagi</font>

131
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,930
antenna with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high output modem using</font>

132
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,880
clear communications now sprint bought

133
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,010
clear communications and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

134
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,450
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> using all the data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they shut them</font>

135
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,490
down so they're forcing people to get

136
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,719
landline connections which means i'd

137
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,830
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to using something like</font>

138
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:05,700
t-mobile now I had an on-premise ESX

server and part of one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the projects I</font>

00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,860
was working on was actually testing two

was using virtual machines<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pass</font>

143
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,070
things back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> forth so that would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

144
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,560
be used for lab and testing purposes not

145
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:24,330
really anything over the wire and this

146
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:27,200
laptop basically which 32 gig of memory

147
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:32,400
and you can pretty much do everything

148
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:34,320
inside the box itself so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine</font>

149
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,219
that testing via wimax<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font>

150
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,590
actually from satellite services like

151
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,120
hughes and directv that you're not going

152
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,710
to you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have crazy amounts of</font>

153
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,030
latency you want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about an</font>

154
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,729
interpreter shoulder<font color="#E5E5E5"> just will not</font>

155
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,469
function whatsoever try doing it with

156
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:51,680
something with that latency especially

157
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:55,110
over a satellite type of communication

158
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,980
so for me the the most important tool

159
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:01,110
was using virtual private server VPS and

160
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:04,020
there's some pricings their digital

161
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:06,300
ocean is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> i use more more often than</font>

162
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,770
not it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like five dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a month you</font>

163
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,410
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend things up and down pretty</font>

164
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,810
quickly and handle most tasks and we'll

165
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,460
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk through like looking at how</font>

166
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">digital ocean kind of looks how you can</font>

167
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,260
create things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and destroy thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

168
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,049
really really fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> lino</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's ten dollars</font>

169
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,389
a month they give you

170
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,610
you give you twice as<font color="#CCCCCC"> much as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

171
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:26,699
digital<font color="#E5E5E5"> ocean eyes digital ocean because</font>

172
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,720
it's more<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost effective there and</font>

173
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:31,569
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much get what you need to get</font>

174
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,459
done there and then have your lifting so

175
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:36,450
say you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> an engagement there</font>

176
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:38,859
you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything run and responder</font>

177
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,529
things that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulling hashes off</font>

178
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,539
the wire any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of brute forcing or if</font>

179
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:47,050
you're running something likes copy for

180
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:50,350
fuzzing amazon AWS you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

181
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:54,359
scale that pretty pretty large but your

182
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost also scales with that as well so</font>

183
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:00,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all VPS is are the same so the</font>

184
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,310
different types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I did out</font>

185
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:05,110
there would be white box engagements or

186
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,880
engagements where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had the customers</font>

187
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,910
they'd give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me the entire layout of</font>

188
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:13,450
their network or their website or their

189
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:17,170
mobile application for testing but one

190
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:18,850
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was important if you're doing</font>

191
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,399
black box testing or you don't a red

192
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,140
team engagement is being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to test</font>

193
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,480
the effectiveness of their defensive

194
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,949
side or their blue team against<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

195
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,959
things so with digital ocean is very

196
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:33,250
easy to set up a box create a snapshot

197
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,869
of that box and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then deploy from places</font>

198
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:38,350
all around the world so you can come

199
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:40,540
from multiple different IPS and then if

200
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,250
you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they start looking at</font>

201
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,410
digital ocean IP space you can switch

202
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,270
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> to line up pretty quickly it gives</font>

203
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:52,510
you a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> options to obfuscate you</font>

204
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:56,649
traffic now<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes you're going to</font>

205
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:58,660
have to do testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that requires you</font>

206
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:59,800
know no latency when you're doing web

207
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,660
testing especially when you're talking

208
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">about automated scanning and enumeration</font>

209
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:07,390
so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually implement with the</font>

210
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:12,550
digital ocean in lino which are fully

211
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:15,160
headless command line only services get

212
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:18,189
KDE or the Vincent VNC connection

213
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,319
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I say kind of working it's</font>

214
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:22,660
basically only used really I only used

215
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,190
it for automated scanning where I could

216
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,439
press a button and let it<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and come</font>

217
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,480
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and pick up results because you</font>

218
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,910
imagine a VNC connection over that speed

219
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,900
is pretty slow then use the

220
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:37,310
Fox proxy so ssh into your VPS solution

221
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,350
and you can come you can pretty much

222
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:44,270
come from anywhere in the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> from IP</font>

223
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:45,980
space and I didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how technical to</font>

224
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,740
make this talk so the screen command

225
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,900
ever familiar with the screen command if

226
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,480
you're on a like a putty session or ssh

227
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,400
session you can use screen to basically

228
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,960
drop your your console and it'll

229
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,189
continue running in the background<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

230
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:03,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll just show that real quick as well</font>

231
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:05,330
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pop in here and see how</font>

232
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,360
well this goes because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can happen to</font>

233
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:10,430
kind of look sideways because my

234
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:15,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">laptop's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not functioning the way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I like</font>

235
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:19,849
it too so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the command console</font>

236
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:26,240
for for digital ocean and it's very very

237
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:28,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">easy to use create a droplet here and</font>

238
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,720
you can see comes some of the pricing

239
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:35,120
there and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really scale upwards</font>

240
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,980
depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your needs there and they</font>

241
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,270
do charge per hour which is nice so like

242
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,200
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to spend something up for a</font>

243
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:44,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple hours and then destroy it it's it</font>

244
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,580
allows you to do that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll reiterate</font>

245
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,310
that importance of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one night I show</font>

246
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:52,250
you another tool that I use multiple

247
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:56,060
different regions you can select from

248
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:57,530
and then whatever type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lenox that</font>

249
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,869
you're really familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a day be</font>

250
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:02,170
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> person myself so using gabion was</font>

251
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,170
pretty easy

252
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:10,679
now is anyone familiar with Armitage

253
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:13,618
from it's an Akali distro anyone

254
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:17,459
familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> kobold strike cobalt</font>

255
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:19,889
strike is the granddaddy of armitage and

256
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:22,910
graphite how much just redesigned it was

257
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:26,939
rereleased at der beek on version 3.0

258
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:30,089
the problem with Armitage the fact that

259
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:31,709
it wraps nmap around interpreter<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

260
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:35,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit around in all those different</font>

261
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:37,888
<font color="#E5E5E5">things we have a problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a waffler</font>

262
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,779
kind of agreement that just was if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

263
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:42,449
not pronouncing that correctly i'm not

264
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:43,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's basically these types of</font>

265
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:47,399
tools cannot be exported to<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

266
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:49,709
countries so<font color="#CCCCCC"> rafael basically took all</font>

267
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:53,850
that functionality out rewrote at waco

268
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:59,878
ball strike works so that's going to be

269
00:12:53,850 --> 00:13:03,170
impossible to read so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

270
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,170
fire that<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and just show you briefly</font>

271
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,040
well you guys can see anybody

272
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,590
alright so i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call off strike</font>

273
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:43,270
directory and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then i'll just run the</font>

274
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:45,100
screen command<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that basically</font>

275
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:47,260
sets it up so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can drop out of</font>

276
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,330
this putty connection or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ssh and that</font>

277
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,280
team server will still be up and running

278
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:53,500
it's very similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> way Armitage works as</font>

279
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,079
far as a team server and armitage works

280
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,700
just fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just happen to have and pay</font>

281
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,440
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a copy of cobalt strike because it's</font>

282
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:07,840
much more for much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more advanced red</font>

283
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:10,050
teaming exercises so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll launch you can</font>

284
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,050
see

285
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,630
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why you don't do live demos</font>

286
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,630
by the way

287
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:39,220
yes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> legitimate password to</font>

288
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,280

289
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:44,890
cobalt strike server feel free the

290
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,319
beauty about using VPS is to do these

291
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:49,000
types of things is that really quickly

292
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,730
you can set them up and destroy them and

293
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a secure scrub feature with line</font>

294
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,420
out as well as digital ocean so if

295
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,300
you're using is for actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> engagements</font>

296
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:00,579
you're able to do to do the job destroy

297
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:04,150
the data are retrieve the data Jinian

298
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,920
and destroy it really quickly one note

299
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,390
is to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you disclose that you're</font>

300
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,430
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using a third-party cloud</font>

301
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:11,410
service before you take on any of these

302
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,849
projects a lot of companies don't want

303
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:20,459
you using something out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of another</font>

304
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:20,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">country alright so that's spun up</font>

305
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,780
as digitalocean never expressed any

306
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:29,959
interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in wanting to be Joseph lied</font>

307
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,250
about running

308
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,490
the question is as digitalocean ever

309
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:39,630
wanted to be notified<font color="#E5E5E5"> about engagements</font>

310
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:41,610
yes i generally notify them if

311
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,870
something's coming from an IP for the

312
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,570
most part they won't say anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless</font>

313
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:47,010
someone comes back to them and says you

314
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:50,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">know there's this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> malicious attack</font>

315
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:52,439
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the IP space and the one</font>

316
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,840
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about digital ocean two is that if</font>

317
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,370
you have like 20 boxes they give you a

318
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,380
limit if you call them up and say hey

319
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,090
I'm doing penetration testing they're

320
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,560
like all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll give you a hundred</font>

321
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:05,790
more the capability to do 100 more boxes

322
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:11,030
so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really check a lot of that</font>

323
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:14,550
stuff and there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> form or anything</font>

324
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:20,880
yep yeah an email the same with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> node</font>

325
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:25,229
and demon VPS<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazon demon VPS similar</font>

326
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,180
pricing to digital ocean as far as how

327
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,710
that runs I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been to using</font>

328
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:32,239
digital ocean and the snapshot feature

329
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:35,400
is really really good so cobalt strike

330
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,410
the cool thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about cobalt strike is so</font>

331
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">and using digital ocean as I can set up</font>

332
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:42,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">20 different IPS are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 different boxes</font>

333
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:45,180
with the same snapshot<font color="#CCCCCC"> run coveops</font>

334
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:49,440
strike team server and it has a feature

335
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:53,880
called beacon the beacon is malleable so

336
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,060
that it can oh there you go thank you

337
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,060
sir

338
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:05,010
read my mind so it's malleable so that

339
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,389
when you're doing anything that's

340
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:09,810
testing really the blue team's

341
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:12,569
capability for detection it can send out

342
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:15,089
at random intervals small pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data</font>

343
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:17,849
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have a half</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meg go to</font>

344
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:20,579
Singapore<font color="#E5E5E5"> another half may go somewhere</font>

345
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:22,800
in New York so you're really hammering

346
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:24,839
down and unfortunately the blue team

347
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,639
where I work now says it's completely

348
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:30,000
unfair because there's no way we could

349
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,500
possibly detect it and I'm like sorry

350
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:39,600
I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Red Team</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> er I don't know how to</font>

351
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:41,100
fix that for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right if anyone</font>

352
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,010
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull up a little bit of cobalt</font>

353
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,629
strike I don't say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did anything</font>

354
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:48,330
to help out with that other than bother

355
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:50,310
much when there's issues I really enjoy

356
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:52,169
using the tool I think it's

357
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,240
underutilized in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bigger</font>

358
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:57,360
organizations so then you wanted to talk

359
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,160
about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> armitage afterwards actually</font>

360
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,790
have done classes on that for a long

361
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:12,860
time I could talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it forever but</font>

362
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:12,860
we'll keep it will keep it light<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

363
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,360
so some of the other implications for

364
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,750
living off the grid<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in another</font>

365
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,189
nation<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hawaii is another country whether</font>

366
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,350
or not they're called themselves estate

367
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,340
I lived in Texas as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well and you can't</font>

368
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:28,000
tell them that they're part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:31,370
United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States it's a republic of texas</font>

370
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,680
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Texas they allow lots of guns and</font>

371
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:35,750
they'll shoot you or in Hawaii it's

372
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,070
pretty impossible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> even get a can't</font>

373
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,600
there's no such thing as concealed carry

374
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:41,919
it takes about<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight days to actually</font>

375
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:45,050
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> your gun registered they're pretty</font>

376
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:48,140
conservative or liberal<font color="#E5E5E5"> about their gun</font>

377
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:50,600
laws another factor that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

378
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:55,160
to take in and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes for any nation</font>

379
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:58,189
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> timezone difference and it's ten</font>

380
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:00,740
hours behind greenwich mean time so like

381
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,150
if you're wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start work on the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">east coast time you have something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

383
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:07,490
present getting up at two o'clock to get

384
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,080
the generator up internet stable if you

385
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:11,240
have an ESX server that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

386
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:15,340
running so that you can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it eight</font>

387
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,780
o'clock meeting it's pretty tough<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

388
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,459
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting that many people start</font>

389
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,470
their work days like this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hawaii it's</font>

390
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,300
it's very common for people to live by

391
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,450
the Sun my sister gets up at

392
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,580
three-thirty she starts working at five

393
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:30,830
done pretty early so the cool thing

394
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,270
about that is that once i'm done around

395
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:35,300
noon<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can have the rest of the day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

396
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:40,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">go to beach surf or dive or whatever</font>

397
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:41,659
something like that yeah see if you're

398
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,550
finished work around noon which is

399
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,710
really nice but generally speaking a lot

400
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:47,480
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are in bed by eight which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

401
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:52,280
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different from anything here on</font>

402
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:55,010
the mainland so how does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply to</font>

403
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,470
us right like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i live in charlotte now</font>

404
00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:00,200
for a big i work for a big organization

405
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:02,240
there where do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to work like I</font>

406
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,430
work in a cube farm like part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

407
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,930
time I still<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have to work off</font>

408
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:07,370
that because where I'm at I'm supposed

409
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,880
to be attacking the outside of the

410
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:12,530
network but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting inside so I've</font>

411
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,710
also be here later and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can ask him</font>

412

<font color="#E5E5E5">why we're still inside they'll be given</font>

413
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,750
the last presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this room he</font>

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,689
like everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that sounds</font>

depending on where you want to work you

428
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:55,170

more about using VPS is to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of host</font>

432
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:04,770
those things because you don't want you

433
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:08,129
don't want your IP at home attacking the

434
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:09,570
internet like you know oops I'm a scan

435

the internet and now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

436
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:15,629
internet because they shut me down type

437
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that's a true story anyone</font>

439
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:21,179
the guy that's the mainframe 767 he

440
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:23,668
tells that story in his talk I work with

441
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:25,230
him down and basically was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a internet</font>

442
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:26,850
for like four days after clearing out

443
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:32,429
some legal things aftermath scanning the

444
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:34,469
entire internet so so why I moved back<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

445
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:38,150
mean obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not Hawaii anymore</font>

446
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:41,850
it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> work I mean it's manual labor</font>

447
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:44,490
not only doing your normal day-to-day

448
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:46,409
life what you would think is pretty

449
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,600
simple you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and go to the bathroom</font>

450
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,370
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the morning you have lights you have</font>

451
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,428
running water like we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> porta-johns</font>

452
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:56,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">and composting toilets you wanted to</font>

454
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:01,830
catchment water heated it up so it's

455
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:04,080
very much you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a difficult thing and</font>

456
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,428
basically I was lazy really I mean I've

457
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,770
missed all the first world problems

458
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:09,299
everyone has like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know all the</font>

462
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,340
red team so that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main thing and</font>

463
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,169
I you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually started trying to</font>

464
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:25,230
generate a buzz about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security</font>

480
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:10,620
Hawaii it's so far out there I mean if

481
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,909
you have to travel all the time and we

482
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:15,000
looked at living off the you know

483
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:18,030
getting off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the farm moving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into an</font>

484
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,650
apartment but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does really consume</font>

485
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:23,070
your time the cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> living is</font>

486
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:25,230
exponential out there like just the

487
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:27,389
studio apartment we were looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

488
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,530
was probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> about five miles from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

489
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:31,620
beach is something like thirty five

490
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:33,000
hundred dollars a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people work two</font>

491
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,489
jobs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they live for their entire</font>

492
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,410
family like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not uncommon for an</font>

493
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:39,120
entire family<font color="#CCCCCC"> like multiple generations</font>

494
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:42,270
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> living in the same house</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in Hawaii</font>

495
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,010
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always would say like I mean I</font>

496
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,900
came back here because I had this

497
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:47,940
opportunity but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't eat paradise I</font>

498
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,280
just didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any money really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

499
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:54,450
doing this remote stuff at least not

500
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:56,820
enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really enjoy myself out boy so</font>

501
00:23:54,450 --> 00:24:00,360
I asked my wife<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was you know</font>

502
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:02,820
getting this talk set up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pros</font>

503
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,500
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for her where it was amazing to</font>

504
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,600
have access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the ocean mountains at</font>

505
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:10,470
the same time and it's literally

506
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:12,090
year-long activities and one of the

507
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:13,680
downfalls a year-long activities of

508
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,330
being outside with no coat hardly any

509
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:19,010
clothes on is that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep a</font>

510
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:22,770
nice body which obviously have let<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

511
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:24,600
after after leaving there so there's all

512
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:28,500
kinds of subsidy around very much an

513
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:30,629
outdoors place some of the cons<font color="#E5E5E5"> any time</font>

514
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,880
you had to get anywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> in traffic it's</font>

515
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:37,560
a second worse than in the u.s. behind

516
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:41,220
of LA one accident can block things<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

517
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,840
mom actually had<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the army</font>

518
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,820
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> to crane down the road he knocked</font>

519
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,000
down one of the supports on one of the

520
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,340
bridges and took her 14 hours to get 20

521
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,990
miles

522
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,669
around that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> roads</font>

523
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:56,100
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> around there so traffic could be</font>

524
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:59,520
a nightmare a single accident can ruin

525
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,990
your entire evening so like getting onto

526
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,670
the other side it should take an hour

527
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,830
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> would take three and you have</font>

528
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:07,140
all these military people around on the

529
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,699
island<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so you have a lot of foreign</font>

530
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,530
drivers that aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to what we call</font>

531
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,540
island island time over there where

532
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:14,700
everyone's driving really slow 45 miles

533
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:17,220
an hour the military<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not used to</font>

534
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,950
driving that speed so rush hour ended up

535
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:23,040
being a nightmare and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned the</font>

536
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:24,450
prices before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found a single lemon</font>

537
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,639
one time we were just we're wanting to

538
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,900
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mexican like if you like Mexican</font>

539
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,310
food you're not going to find it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

540
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,990
Hawaii unless you want canned or

541
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,210
something like that but like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single</font>

542
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:37,350
lemon was two dollars that was like what

543
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:38,670
so pretty bad and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last one there</font>

544
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,709
cane spiders<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

545
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:43,560
picture that but on the on the outhouse

546
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:45,840
so the cane spiders about this big and

547
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,280
if you're in the fields where the

548
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,770
sugarcane is growing they can be like

549
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,960
this big if you drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> in kawaii they'll</font>

550
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:55,200
jump across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> road in front of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

551
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:58,020
car and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we were living on a farm</font>

552
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,160
house without really any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

554
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,970
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we did have any AC or anything</font>

555
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,440
so you'd wake up with cane spiders on

556
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,300
your bed or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that my wife</font>

565
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,780

get you past all the different tourists

598
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,660
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> filipino people there</font>

599
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:56,750
especially on the side of the island i

600
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:59,300
was and my dad loves<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have people come</font>

601
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:01,220
visit him at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the farm and he is one of</font>

602
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:03,260
the few Native Hawaiian speakers left

603
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,770
those all the history and stuff so if

604
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:08,210
you want like the actual Hawaiian

605
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:12,290
experience he he loves to do it he was a

606
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:14,960
tour<font color="#CCCCCC"> guide for many years that's</font>

607
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:21,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have thanks I appreciate</font>

608
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,310
it and if anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> has any questions sure</font>

609
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:31,110
so what was my monthly expenditure for

610
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:33,480
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those different types of</font>

611
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:38,159
things so a lot of times<font color="#E5E5E5"> I bill back to</font>

612
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:40,230
clients the wimax stuff was right around

613
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,590
a hundred dollars a month bps usually

614
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:46,350
ran around two hundred dollars a month

615
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:48,689
so it wasn't super expensive to run all

616
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:51,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">that stuff and I to this day I still use</font>

617
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:53,250
the same techniques because of you know

618
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:55,590
being able to offer you skate where I

619
00:28:53,250 --> 00:29:02,450
come from so I continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use those</font>

620
00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:02,449
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my day-to-day job yes</font>

621
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:14,770
I have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be honest with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

622
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:18,100
max like the implementation kind of died

623
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:20,200
out hawaii was the last guy cold out for

624
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:25,330
wimax and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of it's kind of gone</font>

625
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:27,490
away so yeah I'm not sure all I<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed</font>

626
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:29,350
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the majority of people i knew they</font>

627
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:31,390
wouldn't get like<font color="#E5E5E5"> time warner because it</font>

628
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,980
was like twice as expensive and they

629
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:34,360
would all use wimax<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that's why</font>

630
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,410
sprint when they came<font color="#CCCCCC"> into bottom</font>

631
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,959
they're like nope we're going to

632
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:40,120
throttle everyone back down you guys are

633
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,490
using too much internet whereas the

634
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,739
internet goes right through like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oahu</font>

635
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:47,890

640
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:02,379

00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:03,909
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Frazier any other questions all</font>
