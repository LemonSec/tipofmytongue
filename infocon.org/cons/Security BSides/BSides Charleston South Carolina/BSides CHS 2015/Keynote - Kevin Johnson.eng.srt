16
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,390
told me<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to stand somewhat behind</font>

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,979
the podium so I'm trapped right I'm one

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,690
of those people that I wander all off so

19
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,649

20
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:15,179
video oh well so we're going to talk

21
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:16,380
about security circus this is ok so we

22
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,119
don't talk about security circuits this

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,548
is something that I've ranted about

24
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,710
quite a bit on Twitter and Facebook and

25
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:26,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">LinkedIn and you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to sit here in</font>

26
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,369
a room and hear me rant again<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I feel</font>

27
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,259
like we as an industry are shooting

28
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,820
ourselves in the foot and that's

29
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,200
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good idea especially</font>

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,929
since what we do is so important at

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,180
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it is I may be biased you</font>

32
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,590
know I'm a greedy capitalists and my

33
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,079
entire business depends on people

34
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,360
thinking what we do is important so I

35
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,789
keep trying to push that motto so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

36
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,470
give you a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit about myself</font>

37
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:55,110
basically I'm the<font color="#CCCCCC"> head nerd at secure</font>

38
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,750
ideas a company we formed accidentally

39
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,890
just over five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago was one of</font>

40
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,060
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things where people just kept</font>

41
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,740
calling and saying hey will you do this

42
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I kept saying yes my</font>

43
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,199
wife says I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

44
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,869
uh yeah we could do that no problem I've

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,019
been around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP field for too damn</font>

50
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,940
part of the problem probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> right our</font>

51
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,980
job is to come in beat you up tell you

57
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,280
training and all that kind of stuff I'm

58

anions faculty member if you don't know

59
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,450
about ions it's awesome but again i'm

60
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,160
biased I've written a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

61
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,899
course where for example i wrote the web

<font color="#CCCCCC">pentesting curriculum and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile</font>

63
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,160
security curriculum for sans institute

64
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:56,840

65
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,129
like it you know one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

66
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:04,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">been with them for about two years now</font>

67
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:06,078
so I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um and I have</font>

68
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,870
what if my wife says is the nerdiest

69
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:11,030
thing I've ever done<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pointed out to</font>

70
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:14,660
her that she met me when I was 26 so she

71
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:17,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't know um but I'm a member of the</font>

72
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:20,629
five hundred and first we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a star</font>

73
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:22,879
wars costuming charity group so there's

74
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:25,340
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8,000 members worldwide we build</font>

75
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,660
screen accurate costumes hence<font color="#E5E5E5"> the clone</font>

76
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,870
trooper helmet I didn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to leave on</font>

77
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,220
the table I knew if I left it on the

78
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,560
table like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd look out in the audience</font>

79
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,079
and somebody be wearing it so I'm like

80
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,299
okay no<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not happening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh so we</font>

81
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:40,099
build screen accurate star wars costumes

82
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:41,660
and raise money for charity we go to do

83
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:43,190
hospital visits and things like that

84
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,540
you've probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen us around if you've</font>

85
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,609
been anywhere and there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> Star Wars</font>

86
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,108
characters there last year<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

87
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:51,109
understanding is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> raised 12 million</font>

88
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:52,099
dollars for charity worldwide so it's

89
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:53,870
one of those things where everybody

90
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:55,399
laughs when you say Star Wars costuming

91
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:59,690
and then you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> million dollars they</font>

92
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,190
call oh maybe that's reasonable right so

93
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,599
and you'll hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot about my kids</font>

94
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,389
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that my kids are one of</font>

95
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:08,619
the reasons why security is such a big

96
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:11,299
deal to me right<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh being the guy who's</font>

97
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,889
oldest daughter who's now 13 but when

98
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:15,349
she was<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine her identity was stolen</font>

99
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:17,570
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hospital</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she was at was</font>

100
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:18,918
breached and they got her social

101
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,719
security number her date of birth and

102
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:21,978
everything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> now of course it's okay</font>

103
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,520
because we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the letter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that said they</font>

104
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:27,919
take security very seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh which</font>

105
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,609
I'm sure they do right oh and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they gave</font>

106
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,560
her a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> of free credit monitoring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

107
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,990
problem with that way she<font color="#E5E5E5"> was nine she</font>

108
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,580
was an author<font color="#E5E5E5"> I eligible to actually</font>

109
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,460
sign up for the free credit monitoring

110
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,469
so that's a scam the hospital paid for a

111
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,120
years she couldn't

112
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,740
use it so they still got paid they still

113
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,570
got paid right that's a business you

114
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,180
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do right here pay me for</font>

115
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:51,760
something you can't use thanks but oh

116
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,820
well right but security is a big topic I

117
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,560
mean there are actually TV shows

118
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,510
dedicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what we do you know I</font>

119
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,640
thought we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> it made when in the state</font>

120
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,740
of the union<font color="#CCCCCC"> address they mentioned</font>

121
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">cybersecurity and yes by the way for the</font>

122
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,050
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are cringing I've given up</font>

123
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:13,990
fighting on the word cyber right I I

124
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:14,830
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay coffee and uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> huh right but I</font>

125
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,280
thought when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> State of the Union</font>

126
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:21,760
mentioned cybersecurity I was like wow

127
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:27,039
we're real we matter and now there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

128
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:30,909
CSI cyber which I've not seen I've heard

129
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,500
it's awful but I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> come on we</font>

130
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,840
couldn't have expected much if you ever

131
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,610
watched any of the CSI shows I believe

132
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that most investigators turn on lights</font>

133
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,510
in the rooms they're investigating but

134
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,090
for some reason in the TV show<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

135
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,650
never do always irritated me when i

136
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,229
watch the<font color="#E5E5E5"> show turn on a light you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

137
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,390
find the evidence better but you know so

138
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:53,050
but everybody talks about security

139
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:55,960
everybody does oh you I knew we had a

140
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,930
problem when my grandfather asked me

141
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,940
about security right when my<font color="#E5E5E5"> father in</font>

142
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,830
law is talking about malware and

143
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,570
phishing and things like that not

144
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,969
understanding any of it but you know he

145

<font color="#CCCCCC">things my eyes are brown um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i do want to</font>

149
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:20,349
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> out i did not say good jokes i</font>

150
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,180
just said<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have jokes like i'm a</font>

151
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:25,300
current favorite joke do you guys know

152
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:29,229
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> Walmart wasn't hacked exactly it</font>

153
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:31,720
wasn't a target right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got a bucket</font>

154
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:35,169
list item I got to introduce the CIO of

155
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">Walmart and I told that joke in his</font>

156
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:42,090
introduction he didn't shake my hand

157
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:45,549
right like hey he went like this and

158
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:47,260
walked around<font color="#E5E5E5"> I whoa so but security is</font>

159
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,669
a big deal right everybody talks about

160
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,770
it everybody's worried about it we have

161
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:53,500
PCI you know that you must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be this tall</font>

162
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:55,120
to ride the internet we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> hip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hop</font>

163
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:00,340
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is filled with one</font>

164
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,650
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> too but there's also tons of issues</font>

165
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:06,849
every time we turn around somebody is

166
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:08,080
announcing a new flaw right we somebody

167
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,440
just said it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me this morning right</font>

168
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,210
where an industry run by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google searches</font>

169
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:16,330
right every and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

170
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,969
actually he's right you know that is how

171
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:21,159
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> find out about us and one of the</font>

172
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:25,780
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the security field does is</font>

173
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:28,650
we try to drive as<font color="#CCCCCC"> much attention in in</font>

174
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:32,020
many cases we do it in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong way</font>

175
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:34,080
right there's this idea that well if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

176
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:37,840
hack it people will pay attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font>

177
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:41,289
right if I attack that system if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

178
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,859
this flaw I must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be important right and</font>

179
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:46,810
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in the worst part is every</font>

180
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,389
single time we do this when we start to

181
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,039
go after systems that<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our systems</font>

182
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:53,229
we don't have permission for systems

183
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,599
that we don't control we're actually

184
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:58,240
causing more problems than we're helping

185
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,789
and that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a popular opinion right</font>

186
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,000
as as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by the Twitter</font>

187
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:05,740
replies when I say it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's amazing</font>

188
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,139
how upset people get when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you tell them</font>

189
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,690
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their job sucks hey what you're</font>

190
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:13,960
doing is wrong what we're all doing is

191
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:17,080
wrong in so many ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we make our</font>

192
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,520
jobs more difficult and one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

193
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,590
problems that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address and</font>

194
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,210
this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons why stun</font>

195
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:25,239
tacking and I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

196
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:28,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">term right because most stunt hackers</font>

197
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:32,979
don't have air bags and well in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Jeep</font>

198
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:34,329
they did I guess but uh sorry Charlie we

199
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,690
have to figure out ways to protect

200
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:39,909
ourselves and protecting ourselves

201
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:42,550
includes knowing where the flaws are

202
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,900
right it's one of the problems is if I

203
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,640
don't know where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plies how can I</font>

204
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,740
protect it right in the example I always

205
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,360
give because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've done such a good job</font>

206
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,770
of telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that what we do is</font>

207
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,980
important but we don't do a really good

208
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:56,230
job of explaining why or what the

209
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,480
threats are you know years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I was</font>

210
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,390
teaching this class and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> teaching</font>

211
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,740
people how to crack passwords right and

212
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:06,899
I got a guy in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room and smart guy</font>

213
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,570
and he says to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not worried about</font>

214
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:12,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">people cracking passwords but why not he</font>

215
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:16,350
said cuz I've got the strongest password

216
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,459
really that's awesome let's not point

217
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,680
out the fact that he used the word

218
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:24,810
password singular right so he has the

219
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,550
world's strongest password so it says<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

220
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,939
dude I say dude way too often for

221
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:34,560
someone who doesn't surf but I say dude

222
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:38,550
what is it and he told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me so that's a</font>

223
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,550
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and I'm like we was a</font>

224
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:43,290
four-letter word and it was a name so I

225
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,609
was kind of like how<font color="#E5E5E5"> did you possibly</font>

226
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:48,870
think that's the world's strongest

227
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:51,660
password he's a Kevin I'm 52 years old

228
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:55,830
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was my dog's name when I was</font>

229
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:58,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">five nobody knows my dog's name from</font>

230
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,940
when I was five<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

231
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">we laughs right because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we know what the</font>

232
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,110
attack is we know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing</font>

233
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,050
with accounts and passwords and

234
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:09,120
usernames but in his mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way he</font>

235
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:12,029
understood it was it somebody was going

236
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,050
to go I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna hack him and they were</font>

237
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to target him and they were gonna</font>

238
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">go after his system and after his</font>

239
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,870
computer and after his account and while

240
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,829
I won't sit here and tell you it was a

241
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:26,250
strong password I will agree that if

242
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:29,189
that was the threat if that really was

243
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:33,120
the attack that's stronger than you

244
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:34,829
would think right again not a strong

245
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,450
password but stronger than<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font>

246
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:38,819
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i sit down i explained to the</font>

247
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:40,740
guy nah dude that's not what it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

248
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,220
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the attack we do and by the way</font>

249
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,079
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stop saying dictionary lists</font>

250
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,510
because they're not dictionaries their

251
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,910
lists of strings that could be passwords

252
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:52,950
and I know that's harder to say but

253
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,189
right but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is people go my</font>

254
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:59,630
password is not on a dictionary it's be

255
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:05,160
45 backwards three that's me by the way

256
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:07,529
capital b @ symbol 1l that's not in a

257
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,779
dictionary but we all know it smells

258
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:11,279
baseball right we all know<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

259
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:14,520
password cracker we use would do that

260
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,930
password right but they don't so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm at</font>

261
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,220
winning this guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm like dude this</font>

262
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,290
isn't how it works you know we do this

263
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,000
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is how the attack works and</font>

264
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:24,180
as I'm talking about it his forehead

265
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sweat I did not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

266
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,050
your forehead could sweat right and he

267
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:31,080
got all freaked out and he ran out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

268
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:32,729
the room about 45 minutes later the dude

269
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,529
walks back in like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> way too often</font>

270
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">I say dude right it's like everybody</font>

273
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:46,619

282

00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,350
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cool hack we pull off</font>

284
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:16,470
that we don't actually explain to people

285
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:19,440
what the vulnerability means what it

286
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,630
means to them right and let's not even

287
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,410
get started on what auditors look at

288
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:28,800
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I am so tired of writing</font>

289
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:32,130
findings that say your website doesn't

290
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,020
have autocomplete turned off but I have

291
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">to write it because all of the auditors</font>

292
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,579
will ding them for it but I have to then

293
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,959
say to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person yes I'm well aware of</font>

294
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,779
the fact that every modern browser

295
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:44,160
ignores that setting but because you

296
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:46,560
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it your auditor is going to</font>

297
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,140
have a hissy fit and if I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> write it</font>

298
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">up I'm the guy that missed a serious</font>

299
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,790
find it anybody let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me ask how many</font>

300
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,859
people in the room or pen testers ever

301
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,170
done a pen test ever done a security

302
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:01,170
test right how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this room</font>

303
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,579
have ever compromised somebody because

304
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,790
they visited a website that had

305
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:07,500
autocomplete turned on anybody anybody

306
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:10,920
yeah I didn't think so I'll do the

307
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bueller thing right all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right nobody I</font>

308
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,520
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know anybody who's been hacked by</font>

309
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,089
that but pc i explicitly calls it out

310
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:21,180
what the hell right every order I've

311
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,980
ever looked at says autocompletes on

312
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,880
that

313
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:28,430
bad really what are you done with that

314
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,470
nothing but we worry about it we<font color="#CCCCCC"> freak</font>

315
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:33,140
out about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> we yell at people about it</font>

316
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,370
right we have to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about how</font>

317
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">we find the vulnerabilities how we</font>

318
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,360
understand them but then we start

319
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:41,720
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what systems do you</font>

320
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">control right do you own the system are</font>

321
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,260
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed to test the system I'll tell</font>

322
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:47,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you right now I was doing a test for a</font>

323
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:50,210
customer i was using<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazon instances</font>

324
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,709
and i know right amazon instances you're

325
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,660
allowed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Penn Tesla did you have a</font>

326
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:55,220
form you have to fill out right<font color="#CCCCCC"> you give</font>

327
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,050
the date and where the pen test is

328
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,250
coming from in the time frame and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

329
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:00,740
this kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you send it to</font>

330
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:03,200
amazon and amazon blesses it oh yeah so

331
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,670
you're allowed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> penn des right but</font>

332
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,010
didn't fill<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the form because i</font>

333
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:10,219
wasn't testing amazon<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was testing from</font>

334
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:11,630
amazon so if you're doing a test and of

335
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,220
course this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a test where we were we</font>

336
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:16,370
were trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> determine if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the person</font>

337
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,920
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> detect us right after about a week</font>

338
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:21,200
and a half they detected us and they

339
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,410
reported us amazon and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i get the letter</font>

340
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,240
from amazon saying your instance may be

341
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:29,120
compromised no it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> company so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

342
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,500
was doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right it was me before I</font>

343
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,960
went back said no no it's not

344
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,730
compromised I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a bend test and</font>

345
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,220
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> right back in there like oh if you</font>

346
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,950
pen test amazon you have to let<font color="#E5E5E5"> us know</font>

347
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh my gone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh different directions right</font>

348
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:45,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">i was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> testing from amazon like oh</font>

349
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,180
no you have to let<font color="#E5E5E5"> us know really okay</font>

350
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,930
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to figure out do you control</font>

351
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:52,370
it right do you own that ipod where you

352
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,680
can root it or jailbreak it or whatever

353
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,560
else you want to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right do you</font>

354
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,900
own that car you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to hack you know</font>

355
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,380
all of this stuff is things we have to

356
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:07,550
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if we look at we had to</font>

357
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:09,770
have some cool logos right vota days I'd

358
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:12,079
never knew we've hit the day where we

359
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:15,290
needed vulnerability logos<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm waiting</font>

360
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:17,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> theme songs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would be awesome right</font>

361
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,319
here's cool new vulnerability sing<font color="#E5E5E5"> along</font>

362
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:22,330
with me but uh

363
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,460
all right artists needed work I guess

364
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:28,090
yeah it's all the Liberal Arts degrees

365
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:29,320
but they had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get logos for</font>

366
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,420
vulnerabilities that we start talking

367
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:35,290
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> old man how many people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here were</font>

368
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:38,079
vulnerable to poodle everybody how many

369
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:41,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">people cared yeah I didn't see him in</font>

370
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:44,290
right by the way let me ask why poodle

371
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,900
it's not scary and I know somebody told

372
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:49,150
me that poodles are really mean dogs

373
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:52,180
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not scary looking right but</font>

374
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:53,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay right shell-shocked heartbleed all</font>

375
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,599
these things we have devices out there

376
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:59,230
now how many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here play around</font>

377
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,440
with the nest anybody my wife won't let

378
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:04,660
me get one she said if i get 1 i'll play

379
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">with it when i'm on trips and she's</font>

380
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:10,780
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i get in san diego turning</font>

381
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:12,280
the heat on in jacksonville right but we

382
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,750
start seeing all these flaws when these

383
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:18,069
flaws came out and started<font color="#E5E5E5"> being talked</font>

384
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:20,110
about everybody everybody talked about

385
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:22,570
it right oh did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hear about</font>

386
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:26,840
heartbleed yes what are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna do</font>

387
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:33,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it arnhem patch right</font>

388
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:35,270
it's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do right oh no guys see</font>

389
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:38,120
this one I laughed my ass off of this

390
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:40,640
this was headlines just a few maybe a

391
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,350
month ago these researchers<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the way I</font>

392
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,430
hope you heard the italics in quotes on

393
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:48,710
these researchers in the UK determined

394
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:51,319
there's this kettle that it's wireless

395
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:53,270
it connects<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your internet and you</font>

396
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,970
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile app two canoes are people</font>

397
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:57,680
that like tea rightly good I need to

398
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:01,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure my team's okay but they have</font>

399
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,520
wireless kettles and these researchers

400
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:06,260
did some research and they determined

401
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,329
and I know anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's been in the</font>

402
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,190
scary along the industry longer than a

403
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:14,919
week<font color="#CCCCCC"> will know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this vulnerability</font>

404
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:16,910
um if you d off a wireless client and

405
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,100
then you have a wireless antenna

406
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,110
broadcasting the SSID that wireless

407
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:22,490
device was connecting to that's stronger

408
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:24,919
than the antenna that's in the building

409
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:29,330
the wireless device will authenticate to

410
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:33,950
the fake access point now most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

411
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:36,500
read that and go no but in the UK

412
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:40,490
they had to research it and they

413
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:44,510
published an entire paper that said oh

414
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:46,700
my god<font color="#E5E5E5"> RT is going to be screwed up and</font>

415
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:49,550
they did on his research and it was in

416
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:53,330
the headline<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brian climbing BBC had an</font>

417
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:58,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">article about it and I actually had</font>

418
00:17:53,330 --> 00:18:01,990
customers called me and say Kevin what

419
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:06,520
do we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the kettle's</font>

420
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:08,140
I don't know fill them<font color="#CCCCCC"> with water I like</font>

421
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,540
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really clear how to answer that</font>

422
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,400
question will do you have one of these

423
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,710
kettles on your network and one of the

424
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,570
guys is like no like we didn't don't

425
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:19,420
worry<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop reading those articles stop</font>

426
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,950
clicking links because you know that's

427
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:25,990
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they did write</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> click the link</font>

428
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:29,380
it's awful but don't click but the

429
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:31,360
one guy says to me how would I know how

430
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,760
would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how would I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

431
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,409
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these kettles is on my network so</font>

432
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,400
my only<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer I come up with is walk</font>

433
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:40,720
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and listening to the steam</font>

434
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,780
because I'm hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that whistle right</font>

435
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,700
like those details with soul look for

436
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,889
that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm trying to talk to these</font>

437
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,860
people I'm like these<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not a new fall</font>

438
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:53,050
we have known for at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 years</font>

439
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,350
that wireless access point I might be

440
00:18:53,050 --> 00:19:00,490
exaggerating but this isn't where the

441
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:03,459
problem is yet we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got headlines I had to</font>

442
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:06,670
waste time answering questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> tea</font>

443
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:10,960
kettles because<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody thought they</font>

444
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:13,600
were cool somebody thought hey I'll get

445
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they did they got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attention we're</font>

446
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:20,409
sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> here talking about it right but</font>

447
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:22,840
what real risk does that cattle have on

448
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:25,870
you and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I know I know I've heard</font>

449
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,270
this stupid-ass argument well if we

450
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,010
can't program our kettles right how can

451
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:33,220
we program anything else right and I

452
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:34,990
hate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> disagree I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe and</font>

453
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,570
I know many of my customers have proven

454
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:41,500
me wrong but I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to believe that</font>

455
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:44,550
people take security seriously in

456
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:49,990
applications that require security I

457
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:53,590
honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care if you can hack my</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">if you can hack my nest that was the one</font>

460
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:00,640
was fun right did you remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

461
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,260
about a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago maybe they can</font>

462
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromise the nest how do they do it</font>

463
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:07,900
well they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the nest off the</font>

464
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,030
wall they have to flash the eeprom or

465
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,100
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

466
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:15,000
like they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually physically</font>

467
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:18,090
touch the device<font color="#E5E5E5"> to load a compromise</font>

468
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,950
firmware onto it how about you but if

469
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:23,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">people get into my house to touch my</font>

470
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:28,020
thermostat I have bigger worries right

471
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:30,659
there in my house I've got better things

472
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:35,790
for them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to grab than a nest that they</font>

473
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:38,550
could buy right<font color="#E5E5E5"> then hey we see a lot of</font>

474
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:40,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">people talk about self-testing we should</font>

475
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,070
be able to test ourselves the problem is

476
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,750
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't know how to test</font>

477
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:45,810
themselves right how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people here</font>

478
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:47,760
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to run Nessus what I</font>

479
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:50,940
thought how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know how to</font>

480
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,670
validate what Nessus is doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

481
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,590
script that it ran<font color="#E5E5E5"> against that system</font>

482
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:56,640
fewer hands went up right how many

483
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,590
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know how to write their own</font>

484
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,190
nazil scripts to test something custom

485
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,570
for themselves even fewer hands so we

486
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to test ourselves and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm picking</font>

487
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:07,290
on Nessus just because it's a well-known

488
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,370
popular device not be a software not

489
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:11,490
because there's anything wrong with

490
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:13,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nessus right but most people don't know</font>

491
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:15,090
how to test themselves it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

492
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:18,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a lot of people like you know what</font>

00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:30,680
from this guy how do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know Rob</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">shell shock came out he scanned the</font>

entire internet for shell shock and he

502
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:48,300
posted this picture of a system that was

00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,680

vulnerable and it's him running a ping

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,919
command against himself so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way he</font>

509
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,530
determined<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the system was</font>

510
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,810
vulnerable is he ran an arbitrary

00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:08,399
command yes when I talked to him<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

ping

516
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,700
that's what you're using you to not

517
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:20,920
understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it means right I a he's</font>

running commands on<font color="#E5E5E5"> people's servers yes</font>

519
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:27,180
I will acknowledge that running a ping

520
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:30,399
command is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to hurt anybody but</font>

00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:33,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">the guy who runs that system now has to</font>

respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> right because they don't know</font>

564
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">because it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was down</font>

565
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,460
we week and a half almost two weeks

566
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:26,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">right did not have access to it I know</font>

567
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,600
this because I was testing some iOS apps

568
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,889
during that time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't get to the</font>

569
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,469
documentation that i was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

570
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:34,960
research to help my client better

571
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:37,000
develop their software because the apple

572
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,150
developer network was down pissed me off

573
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,070
right this guy he's like I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

574
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,660
know you talked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> him when you talked</font>

575
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:46,480
him on Facebook or Twitter or wherever

576
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:48,640
his answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> was well my hero Apple</font>

577
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,710
shouldn't have been vulnerable<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

578
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,670
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> right that building shouldn't</font>

579
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:56,800
have been flammable<font color="#CCCCCC"> um and his answer</font>

580
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:58,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was okay well fine they should have</font>

581
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,879
been vulnerable I'll agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

582
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:03,580
why did you pull 100,000 records I had

583
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,220
to prove the vulnerability existent my

584
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:07,990
answer that is glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> you pen</font>

585
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,270
tense all the time and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't pull</font>

586
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,800
100,000 records to prove the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sites</font>

587
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:15,520
vulnerability co-injection I don't have

588
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:18,070
to i can run a count of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the records i</font>

589
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,240
would have pulled and tell my customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

590
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:22,149
could have pulled a hundred thousand

591
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,250
records right well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can show them look</font>

592
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:26,260
I do this this this this the error

593
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:28,660
message changes you're vulnerable now

594
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,700
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying that I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go and pull</font>

595
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,490
data if it's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rules of engagement</font>

596
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,710
and it's within scope I will pull data

597
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,960
I'll pivot through that sequel server

598
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:40,060
Microsoft's or whatever right to get

599
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the internal network if that's in</font>

600
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:44,080
the rules of engagement<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's</font>

601
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:47,169
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has a signature this is</font>

602
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:50,439
I'm not going to jail for doing this

603
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:52,750
it's a nice paper to have right this guy

604
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,700
didn't have it you didn't need to pull a

605
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,410
hundred thousand records to prove it he

606
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,300
had to pull 100,000 records so he could

607
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,880
do a cool blog post and get attention

608
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:05,980
that's why he pulled a hundred thousand

609
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:08,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">records right but don't worry he posted</font>

610
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:13,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">this on Twitter Apple this is definitely</font>

611
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:16,060
not an hack attack I am NOT an hacker I

612
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:19,810
do security research here's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> youtube</font>

613
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:21,520
video now couple problems with this will

614
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,780
ignore the grammar he's from Turkey I'm

615
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,460
assuming English is in his first

616
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:29,230
language right um but one problem I'm

617
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,900
not a hacker it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing last night I</font>

618
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,460
robbed a jewelry store I

619
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,730
gun on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy who said don't worry I'm</font>

620
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:41,120
not an armed robber he still gave me the

621
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:43,680
money you can't self-identify as safe

622
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,189
you say a hundred thousand records guess

623
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:50,130
what you are a hacker this is a hack

624
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:53,670
attack you may not be malicious you may

625
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:57,270
just be stupid right the other problem

626
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:59,580
with this is Apple is following this guy

627
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:02,129
least according this guy because he

628
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:05,580
didn't tag them in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tweet his</font>

629
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:10,350
assumption is he is so important that

630
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:12,179
Apple follows him right no they don't

631
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:14,760
they don't follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of us probably</font>

632
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:18,750
right except for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bill everybody follows</font>

633
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:21,330
bill<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah no Chris you know he had to</font>

634
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:23,850
prove it further<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google Play crashed</font>

635
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:26,699
right after that twice wasn't enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

636
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:31,520
crash at once he had to do it twice why

637
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:37,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">cuz he had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to prove it was real no again</font>

638
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:41,129
all you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is dick waving I mean</font>

639
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:43,500
all it is on bigger than you are hahaha

640
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:46,200
look what I was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do I'm sorry</font>

641
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,540
this is why we have a stereotype that we

642
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,880
live in our parents basement any pizza

643
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,830
and can't get dates and that's a

644
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,740
stereotype I'm not saying it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> true but</font>

645
00:27:52,830 --> 00:28:00,990
this is why because we do stupid

646
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:02,520
like this and we encourage<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right I'll</font>

647
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:04,260
guarantee you that there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> people up</font>

648
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,690
on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide their images up on this</font>

649
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,670
side that you look at and go asshole and

650
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:11,120
there are also people up there that you

651
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:15,270
look at and going<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah he's awesome</font>

652
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:18,689
right personally we've that's the first

653
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:20,220
one for me right is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> my opinion not</font>

654
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:23,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying it's yours right my opinion I</font>

655
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:26,090
immediately think<font color="#CCCCCC"> asshole the gesture i</font>

656
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:30,149
live in<font color="#CCCCCC"> coke</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah do it stay frosty</font>

657
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:31,439
right but the reality is there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

658
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,840
much difference between either of them

659
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,510
from a perspective of what they're

660
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,679
accomplishing right there different

661
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,540
people they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have different personalities</font>

662
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,420
and gesture of course is an entire

663
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:43,290
nation state in and of himself my

664
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,320
opinion

665
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:49,590
right but we look at these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

666
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,000
anonymous how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people here look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

667
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:53,970
naught amiss and go yeah that's a good

668
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,870
thing right the one that ideas came out

669
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,650
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came out with</font>

670
00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:00,719
writers are releasing KKK members I

671
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:03,360
don't know many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who can look at</font>

672
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,270
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that we're outing clan members</font>

673
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,659
that are in positions of power and think

674
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:12,960
to ourselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know those poor clan</font>

675
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:17,220
members that's so sad nobody says that

676
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:21,800
accept clan members right most of us I

677
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:25,020
hope look at and go yeah shoot<font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font>

678
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:28,590
racism shocks and I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a white</font>

679
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:31,020
guy right but the reality is most people

680
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:33,240
go yeah that's fine go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out out clan</font>

681
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,710
members that's a great idea well except

682
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,360
you know a week before they were

683
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,550
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to release it another asshole</font>

684
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,530
released a whole bunch of other names of

685
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:42,600
people and pretended to be anonymous

686
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:46,050
because you know how your anonymous you

687
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:51,330
say you are right who's in charge<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:37,419
I'm well aware that like I said anybody

707
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,639
can be a member of anonymous for awhile

708
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:42,370
they were releasing undercover police

709
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,980
members names addresses and phone

710
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:46,810
numbers and I don't care what your

711
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,240
opinion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the police are it's probably</font>

712
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:52,990
not a good idea I have a friend whose

713
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:55,810
husband was a cop it was a detective<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

714
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:57,690
name was released by anonymous there

715
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:59,820
were people showing up at her house

716
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:02,590
there were people banging on the door

717
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:05,110
throwing stuff at windows and she's

718
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:10,389
there alone right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he's on shift</font>

719
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:13,449
he's working so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question becomes is</font>

720
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:14,980
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay right and I don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

721
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:17,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">answer I really don't know the answer I</font>

722
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,090
can't sit here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I'm okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> without</font>

723
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:20,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">in clan members I'm not okay with outing</font>

724
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:23,860
police officers so some of the times

725
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:27,370
you're decent how does that work what's

726
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:31,000
the morality we've decided on what's the

727
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:33,909
ethics we've decided on right so what do

728
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,040
we do as people now I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very clear</font>

729
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:38,140
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to talk about what do we</font>

730
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:41,950
do as researchers<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

731
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:44,410
researcher title is most of us

732
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:47,350
who call ourselves research to

733
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:52,300
researchers are wrong we're not doing

734
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:54,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">the research most there is no research</font>

735
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,919
necessary to understand that putting a

736
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:59,320
single quote in that form field called a

737
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,180
sequel error that's not research we've

738
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:05,649
known about sequel injection for 90

739
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:09,760
years right again small exaggeration may

740
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:11,500
be right that's not research that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

741
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">how research works research is finding a</font>

00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:17,200

743
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:19,180
research is finding a brand new

744
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:23,070
classification of vulnerability that

745
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:25,960
nobody knew existed that's research

acunetix against it right

751
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:42,399
enjoy yourselves that's not giving you

00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:44,769
permission to do it you probably want to

00:32:55,629 --> 00:32:58,329
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about what to do as</font>

758
00:32:56,649 --> 00:33:01,508
researchers because in my opinion you're

759
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:02,739
not researchers I get it we want to find

760
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:05,319
vulnerabilities and I have no issue with

761
00:33:02,739 --> 00:33:07,119
that I have no issue with buying a piece

762
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:09,309
of software and testing it yourself in

763
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:11,829
your own lab I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have no issue with buying</font>

764
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:16,959
the car and testing it yourself in your

765
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:18,579
own lab your system<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what do we</font>

766
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:20,229
do is the people who have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to respond to</font>

767
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:22,269
this what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do is the people who</font>

768
00:33:20,229 --> 00:33:24,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to manage the systems that are</font>

769
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:28,089
under attack and how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine</font>

770
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:31,928
that the guy from turkey isn't a hack

771
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:34,149
attack as he put it how do we keep track

772
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:35,649
of that how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we possibly determine</font>

773
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:39,158
that and I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you that in most</font>

774
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:43,389
industries are saying that it's probably

775
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:46,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rob is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough when we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go to</font>

776
00:33:43,389 --> 00:33:49,718
management it's not enough when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go to</font>

777
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:53,529
the auditors it's not enough when the

778
00:33:49,719 --> 00:33:55,689
next breach happens and they say why

779
00:33:53,529 --> 00:33:59,019
didn't you respond to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous one I</font>

780
00:33:55,689 --> 00:34:03,159
assumed it was robbed why that's what he

781
00:33:59,019 --> 00:34:07,269
does right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know his IP address he's a</font>

782
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:09,490
127 dot five dot five dot six right it's

783
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:11,529
an evil hacker at that IP address so

784
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:13,839
what do we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's number of options</font>

785
00:34:11,529 --> 00:34:17,559
this of course is the first option I

786
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:20,500
don't recommend this one right panic run

787
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:23,440
around screaming yeah what attack shut

788
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:26,940
off the internet it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always my favorite</font>

789
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,940
don't worry we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the darknet I</font>

790
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:34,268
couldn't do it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this very face I</font>

791
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:36,730
Drive don't knit that's when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you browse</font>

792
00:34:34,268 --> 00:34:39,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet with the lights off</font>

793
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:40,179
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blind single injection its</font>

794
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,179
sequel injection but you keep your eyes

795
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:45,179
closed<font color="#E5E5E5"> but so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> panic right runaround</font>

796
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:47,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">threat this is what our management does</font>

797
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:49,418
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here have worked for an</font>

798
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:50,918
industry a company and had the owner of

799
00:34:49,418 --> 00:34:55,049
the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> or management come to you</font>

800
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:58,930
and say are we vulnerable to something

801
00:34:55,050 --> 00:35:00,250
right my old boss might<font color="#E5E5E5"> poor always</font>

802
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,379
tells<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story where he was there in</font>

803
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">this general walked in and the general</font>

804
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:08,740
said how many false positives did we see

805
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:11,410
today and he's like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten right</font>

806
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:17,520
whatever the number was good how many

807
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:20,500
false negatives did we see none good

808
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,390
right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you see the false</font>

809
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,270
negative it's not a false negative

810
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:26,560
anymore just<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it is it's like that</font>

811
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,880
vendor you guys remember the vendor that

812
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,470
used to advertise I don't know the name

813
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:34,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">of them- day protection here's know they</font>

814
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:36,790
had t-shirts they said negative did you

815
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:38,740
remember the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor who it was oh I mean</font>

816
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:40,270
we got to pick on them because i like i

817
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,950
love it right<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero day we all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agree that</font>

818
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:44,259
a zero-day is a vulnerability that

819
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:46,149
exists there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no patch for right</font>

820
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,310
that's a zero day but one definition of

821
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:51,850
a zero-day so a negative day would be a

822
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:54,220
vulnerability that doesn't exist pay me

823
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:56,730
money I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guarantee you I will protect you</font>

824
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:59,740
against all<font color="#E5E5E5"> non-existent vulnerabilities</font>

825
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:03,160
and the best part is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's agentless its</font>

826
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:05,290
cloud-based awesome right<font color="#CCCCCC"> done if you're</font>

827
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,690
not vulnerable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to attack I will protect</font>

828
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:09,100
you against<font color="#CCCCCC"> that attack right that's</font>

829
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:11,950
what the vendor was basically announcing

830
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:14,650
total different story right but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

831
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:19,060
panic not a good idea we could deny the

832
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:21,220
problem can anybody say<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco Rick fire</font>

833
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:22,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">OTT no it wasn't us we weren't hacked</font>

834
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,270
but picture for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people who don't</font>

835
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,980
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Barbra Streisand's house so it</font>

836
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:29,650
started the whole Streisand effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

837
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:31,510
actually didn't know what the story was

838
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:33,609
I've used the term Streisand effect

839
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,960
forever and never knew the story until I

840
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:37,299
was writing this talk I actually went

841
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,400
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and researched it turns out some guy</font>

842
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,980
got in a plane and he photographs the

843
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,859
entire coastline of California and he

844
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:47,109
posted it online right and Barbra

845
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:49,328
Streisand or parva Streisand people

846
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:51,578
right somebody associated with Barbra

847
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:53,829
Streisand said take that picture down

848
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:58,720
that's her house we don't want people

849
00:36:53,829 --> 00:37:00,789
seeing it on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beach boats see it</font>

865
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:36,190
could we tell people to stop talking

866
00:37:34,749 --> 00:37:38,470

1060
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:51,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to be aware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of how the business</font>

1062
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:57,700

1063
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:59,590
stuff and then finally bug bounties how

1064
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:02,500

1067
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,740

1068
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:07,900
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only person in the room raised your</font>

1069
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:09,220
hand let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me ask you a question how much</font>

1070
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:14,200
security testing do you do for your

1071
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:18,009

1073
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:22,300
program if you have a bug bounty program

1074
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:25,799
and I find cross-site scripting in the

1075
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:29,470
search box in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your website you fail a</font>

1076
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:34,420
bug bounty program should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

1077
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:37,060
built well done security process now

1078
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:39,010
let's go see what else we missed a bug

1079
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:41,950
bounty program should not be the first

1080
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:44,680
step right too many companies do it we

1081
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:46,439
have a bug bounty program really what

1082
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:49,859
other security do you do when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept</font>

1083
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:52,260
submissions no no other security right

1084
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:53,759
what's your sdlc what is your monitoring

1085
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:56,300
process do you have a handle on what

1086
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,740
systems are even on your network right

1087
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,180
start looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for real security before</font>

1088
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:03,540
you start doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of stuff and</font>

1089
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:04,950
then go do this kind of stuff right but

1090
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:07,529
if you're not doing security well at the

1091
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:09,569
beginning why bother with this hell

1092
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:11,069
let's be honest if you're not doing

1093
00:47:09,569 --> 00:47:14,130
security well in the beginning why even

1094
00:47:11,069 --> 00:47:16,319
hire a pen tester right if I come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1095
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:19,260
I find vulnerabilities if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find ms</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 08</font>

1096
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:22,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">06 7 on your network right you've wasted</font>

1097
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:24,089
your money and time hiring me right

1098
00:47:22,109 --> 00:47:26,160
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to find that</font>

1099
00:47:24,089 --> 00:47:29,670
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> you shouldn't need somebody</font>

1100

do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an industry find</font>

1105
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:47,730
vulnerabilities find out where the

1106
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:50,490
weaknesses are but do it in a way that

1107
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:52,980
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not screwing the entire world for</font>

1108
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:55,140
our own edification right that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I</font>
