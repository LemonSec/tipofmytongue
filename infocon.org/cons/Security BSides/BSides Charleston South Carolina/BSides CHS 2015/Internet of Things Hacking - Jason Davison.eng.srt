00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:30,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">a sexed up my talk a little bit they</font>

3
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:35,120
they gave me the title hacking the

4
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:37,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet of Things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I really really I</font>

5
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,199
think they basically gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> me the</font>

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:46,339
equivalent of clickbait for talk titles

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:51,320
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not quite that sexy but we'll</font>

good work and I mean twitter is cool so

16
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:19,069
hit me up on Twitter at Jason Davison

17
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:24,170
then we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get down to</font>

18
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:26,869
business here so so why are we<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

19
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,659
today well we're here to celebrate

20
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:31,219
information security<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I'm here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

21
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:34,579
about a little bit of research<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did in</font>

22
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:39,499
school and I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convey a</font>

23
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:42,048
message to the non-standard infosec

24
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:44,329
audience so if if you don't work in

25
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:47,929
infosec job for year 80 hours a week or

26
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:49,579
whatever we work this this kind of talk

27
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:52,700
is targeted a little bit towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and</font>

28
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:54,348
how you can take your first steps and

29
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">get started in information security</font>

30
00:01:54,349 --> 00:02:00,919
things like that so yeah for those of

31
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,709
you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in school for those of you if</font>

32
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:05,598
you you if you're not in school and

33
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:07,639
you're in infosec and you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

34
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:11,410
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun to do you know what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

35
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:11,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hack the planet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> man</font>

36
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:18,120
so here's here's a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at our agenda</font>

37
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:21,358
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the next 30 minutes to an hour</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,249
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't go till time I first</font>

39
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:26,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to introduce and formalize the</font>

40
00:02:23,249 --> 00:02:30,359
concept of the Internet of Things talk

41
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,950
about what it is what is becoming and

42
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:34,079
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a little bit about how</font>

43
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,328
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bluetooth fits in there and why</font>

44
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:39,989
bluetooth is a good fit and then we'll

45
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:41,780
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the Bluetooth protocol and how</font>

46
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:44,489
Bluetooth devices identify themselves

47
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:48,000
the pairing process bluetooth

48
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:50,549
communication things like that and then

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll step into my research which</font>

50
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:55,139
includes this lovely light bulb and I

51
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,480
hopefully will give you a working demo

52
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:59,909
and we can move forward with questions

53
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,569
and a wrap it up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a conclusion there</font>

54
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:05,159
at the end also I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to get</font>

55
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:07,589
this out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there this is this is my first</font>

56
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,599
presentation so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is much a learning</font>

57
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,139
experience for me as I hope it is for

58
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you so if you have constructive</font>

59
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:18,180
criticism or any criticism really feel

60
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:24,209
free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share that with me so I can</font>

61
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:26,879
become<font color="#E5E5E5"> better at this so formalizing the</font>

62
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet of Things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> such a flashy were</font>

63
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,370
used by the news and in other various

64
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,560
industries too well for clickbait things

65
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:39,509
like that so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the Internet of</font>

66
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:43,439
Things well the IOT can be thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> of I</font>

67
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:46,439
I think of the IOT as a world where

68
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:49,728
every physical device is connected to

69
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:53,698
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet you can imagine trash cans</font>

70
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:56,060
refrigerators toasters dishwashers

71
00:03:53,699 --> 00:04:00,090
laundry machines things of that nature

72
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:02,069
all connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet and you</font>

73
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,739
know you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine your fridge telling</font>

74
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:06,238
you you're out of milk or you need eggs

75
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:08,329
your washing<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine has the capability</font>

76
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,560
to tell you that your laundry<font color="#CCCCCC"> is done or</font>

77
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:12,389
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> your dishwasher telling you to</font>

78
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,370
empty empty<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dishwasher it's ready</font>

79
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:20,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">for ready for another cycle so 10</font>

80
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:23,010
billion wire wirelessly connected

81
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:26,520
devices existed in 2013

82
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:28,050
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forward the ABI research</font>

83
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">group predicted that there would be 30</font>

84
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:34,890
billion devices connected by 2020 so

85
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:38,550
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the IOT is really</font>

86
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:41,580
something that isn't isn't already here

87
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:44,760
we are already<font color="#E5E5E5"> experiencing it and I</font>

88
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">think as as the infosec community and as</font>

89
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,110
members<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information security</font>

90
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:54,210
researchers are just<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec</font>

91
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:56,670
professionals I think it's our our duty

92
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,219
to basically try to do our<font color="#E5E5E5"> best to bake</font>

93
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:02,850
security into the Internet of Things now

94
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,350
as opposed to where that where it's been

95
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:08,970
done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past where security is just</font>

96
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:11,600
kind of spread out<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a frosting so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

97
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,950
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to i would like to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

98
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,400
taking place here over the next several

99
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,719
years so now we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know where does</font>

100
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,090
blue to its really<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit into all this</font>

101
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:26,250
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> bluetooth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a nice short range</font>

102
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:32,369
protocol and it it has a niche kind of

103
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:34,950
in IOT as opposed to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> finds more of</font>

104
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:40,800
its niche in IOT<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think as I OT bros</font>

105
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bluetooth will also grow so a little bit</font>

106
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of background on Bluetooth Bluetooth</font>

107
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:48,120
protocol has been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> since 1994 and</font>

108
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:50,729
it offers us convenient use for everyday

109
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,370
technology things like your headsets

110
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:56,670
your your hardware on your computer like

111
00:05:53,370 --> 00:06:00,120
various wireless keyboards and mice this

112
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,950
light bulb so bluetooth bluetooth is all

113
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:07,140
around us already so that that's nice

114
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:09,060
and as I OT<font color="#E5E5E5"> grows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i sub</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I suspect that</font>

115
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:13,200
they will they will grow together as I

116
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:15,120
was previously saying the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

117
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bluetooth devices currently being</font>

118
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,070
shipped<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe bluetooth estimates</font>

119
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,630
that will be 3 billion devices being

120
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:25,200
shipped currently every year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

121
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:27,630
suspect by 2019 that there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be five</font>

122
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,320
billion bluetooth capable devices being

123
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:34,330
shipped every year and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty</font>

124
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,280
trivial point at the bottom but the more

125
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:41,500
popular something becomes whether it be

126
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:43,119
a protocol or as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT grows it's a</font>

127
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:48,069
high it becomes a higher value target

128
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:50,319
two attackers so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I like guys</font>

129
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:52,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">like i said i'd like to see security</font>

130
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">being baked in now as opposed to spread</font>

131
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,378
on top later before<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's too late and</font>

132
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:01,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people over at bluetooth do a good</font>

133
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:04,360
job they take they take security really

134
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,550
seriously and when they implement a new

135
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,509
new version kind of of the protocol or

136
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:16,240
they move on they make sure that they're

137
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:19,030
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in as well so bluetooth</font>

138
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,699
networks well how are they structured so

139
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:23,650
a Bluetooth Network basically is you can

140
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:27,120
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a piconet or a personal</font>

141
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:29,888
area network traditionally a piconet

142
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,520
consists of one master device where the

143
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:36,099
master device is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the smartest device in</font>

144
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:40,750
the piconet it can be thought of as the

145
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:43,449
defining device and here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see there's</font>

146
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:47,199
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> master and it connects to one slave</font>

147
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:51,400
device this can this can be represented

148
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:55,080
here by my ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect to the</font>

149
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,080
light bulb maybe

150
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:06,320
so we have our one master device which

151
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,120
is my cell phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we are able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

152
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:13,610
control our slave device in this case

153
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:15,980
the light bulb but you can also imagine

154
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:19,070
where we could have multiple devices in

155
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,870
a piconet one too many so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had seven</font>

156
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:24,280
in these typically one master can

157
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:26,360
connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to seven slave devices and</font>

158
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,400
well let's be honest seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

159
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:34,550
would be awesome your life would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

160
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:36,949
non-stop party so yeah that's that's

161
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:41,839
basically how<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth networks are</font>

162
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:44,680
generally structured so how did

163
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,150
Bluetooth devices identify themselves

164
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,550
well you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of a Bluetooth device</font>

165
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:52,640
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a unique 48-bit identifier</font>

166
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,290
similar to a mac address basically it's

167
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,510
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exact same thing except</font>

168
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's structured a little bit differently</font>

169
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,520
each<font color="#CCCCCC"> bluetooth address consists of three</font>

170
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:07,550
parts as can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be seen in my awesome</font>

171
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:10,970
diagram there the n AP<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first two</font>

172
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:14,000
bytes is the upper or<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-significant</font>

173
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:17,630
address part my apologies the next one

174
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,670
bite is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the upper address part and the</font>

175
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:23,900
last three bites are the lower address

176
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:26,240
part now together<font color="#E5E5E5"> the non-significant</font>

177
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,220
address part and the upper address part

178
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,270
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first three bytes make up the</font>

179
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:34,550
manufacturer ID and the last three bytes

180
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:36,319
make up the device ID which is assigned

181
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:40,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the device unique to the device</font>

182
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,560
assigned by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the manufacturer and and</font>

183
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:47,329
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Tau Bluetooth devices</font>

184
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,609
identify themselves moving forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

185
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,140
talk about the pairing process here so

186
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:54,620
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> two devices can be gang</font>

187
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:57,020
communicating with one another they must

188
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,840
first be paired and before they can

189
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:02,960
begin paring the master device has to be

190
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,430
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discover</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the slave and this</font>

191
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,890
pairing process is probably not the

192
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:09,979
pairing process that everybody's used to

193
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:12,860
you're probably used to just a user

194
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,470
interaction enter the passkey in pin

195
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,350
this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

196
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:19,780
dated but you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as user</font>

197
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,280
interaction so that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

198
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,939
generally is needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start the pairing</font>

199
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,890
process so before<font color="#E5E5E5"> before they can</font>

200
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,600
connect the master<font color="#E5E5E5"> must discover the</font>

201
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:31,600
slave or they must enter an inquiry

202
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,970
phase when you're in discovery mode

203
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,920
you're basically sending out requests

204
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:39,820
and waiting for other<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices to reply</font>

205
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you with with the address or with</font>

206
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:46,270
their address or what gets the pairing

207
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:49,420
process started and in some cases with

208
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:52,090
where Bluetooth devices require<font color="#E5E5E5"> UI that</font>

209
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:56,890
could be a passkey I believe it can be

210
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:59,940
anywhere between 44 and 16 digits<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

211
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:02,380
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> default on most devices is 0000</font>

212
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:06,190
that's the default pass key to start the

213
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:10,360
pairing process so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

214
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:12,670
see never are any of the authentication

215
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,070
or any of the keys created are never

216
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:19,150
sent in transit a random number is

217
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:22,510
always generated on both devices and in

218
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:24,670
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the first one the master</font>

219
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:27,610
device tries to sync up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slave</font>

220
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:31,660
their clock the master devices clock is

221
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:33,190
used to sync the slave device so they're

222
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,280
both generating these numbers off the

223
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,870
Masters clock and the pairing process is

224
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,540
complete<font color="#E5E5E5"> after it goes through all these</font>

225
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,730
steps all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps here and each time</font>

226
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">a random number is generated it's just</font>

227
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:48,040
to make sure that the slave device is

228
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:55,080
still on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same page as the master</font>

229
00:11:48,040 --> 00:12:00,060
device pairing process

230
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:02,220
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth does does this pretty</font>

231
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,250
interestingly so paired devices they

232
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:08,670
move between 79 channels 1,600 times per

233
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:11,910
second so what bluetooth device what

234
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:13,680
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> master device does is once</font>

235
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,800
everybody in the piconet is<font color="#CCCCCC"> synced up</font>

236
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,260
using the master devices clock it'll

237
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,510
develop a advanced frequency hopping map

238
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:25,020
where devices can move across channels

239
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:28,350
and this is generally this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is generally</font>

240
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,890
done to avoid a noisy noisy channel so

241
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:34,170
this is done the map has created so

242
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:36,240
devices the communication channel to

243
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:39,000
stay open<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bluetooth operates</font>

244
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:43,260
around 2.4 4 gigahertz and 2.4 gigahertz

245
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,720
is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much the garbage band so this</font>

246
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">afh map comes in handy when when devices</font>

247
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,310
are trying to talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other this</font>

248
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,640
also makes it really difficult to

249
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:55,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">passively sniff Bluetooth traffic that</font>

250
00:12:53,640 --> 00:13:00,720
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something that's done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tripoli</font>

251
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:03,390
fully<font color="#CCCCCC"> tripoli you generally have to get</font>

252
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,690
a special a special dongle<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go ahead</font>

253
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:09,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">and go ahead and try to passively sniff</font>

254
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:15,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bluetooth traffic which I'll talk about</font>

255
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:17,699
here in a little bit so my research if

256
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:20,569
anybody wants to take a nap<font color="#E5E5E5"> or anything</font>

257
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,570
just it's cool

258
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:27,000
well I was given so I was approached by

259
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,699
my professor at school and there were

260
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,090
three devices that we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> given our</font>

261
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:35,780
research topic was hacking IOT and I

262
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:38,850
ended up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth light bulb</font>

263
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:41,520
the other one was a drop cam and one was

264
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:43,620
a door lock that operated via bluetooth

265
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:47,930
which probably would be really really

266
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:51,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool to get my hands on one of those so</font>

267
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:54,089
when I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> my research I wanted to</font>

268
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,320
basically think about all right how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

269
00:13:54,090 --> 00:14:02,250
how can what<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential attack vectors</font>

270
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:04,170
does this light have and obviously there

271
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,720
was one main attack vector they

272
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:08,310
communicate via the application the

273
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,340
mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> application communicates to the</font>

274
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:12,930
light bulb the bluetooths basically so

275
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,820
there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth protocol I had to</font>

276
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:17,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at how to figure out all right how</font>

277
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,830
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this protocol work where does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

278
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:21,900
implement security well what potential

279
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:24,510
what potential attack vectors<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist</font>

280
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,130
there and the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that I wanted</font>

281
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,810
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at was how does the mobile</font>

282
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">application control the light bulb so</font>

283
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:32,609
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the mobile app using bluetooth to</font>

284
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:35,580
get the light bulb to change colors or

285
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:41,670
flash or whatever whatever functionality

286
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:44,160
you choose and that I didn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

287
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:46,170
attack the mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> application because at</font>

288
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,969
what point does attacking the mobile

289
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:51,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">application become attacking the phone</font>

290
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:54,600
and then if you if you have to root the

291
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:57,750
phone ahead have you really attacked the

292
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,580
light bulb it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a circum be kind</font>

293
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">of circumvent just attacking the light</font>

294
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:03,330
bulb through through that methodology so

295
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:08,459
I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay stay away from that as</font>

296
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:13,020
much as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could so this fantastic</font>

297
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:16,370
project uber tooth one Michael I believe

298
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:20,189
it's developed by Michael Osmond and

299
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:22,200
this allows you to passively detect

300
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:25,860
Bluetooth devices and follow them

301
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:29,040
through the afh map and follow them

302
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:32,199
through channel hopping things like that

303
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,689
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't I'm trying not to I'm trying to</font>

304
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:37,628
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> this at a little bit of a higher</font>

305
00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:39,099
level but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovery of the upper</font>

306
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:44,649
address part is what's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

307
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:46,899
with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth because you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

310
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:54,969
in in plain text so that's that's pretty

311
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:58,059
trivial to capture the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Li p the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uap</font>

312
00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:00,939
however the upper address part is much

313
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:03,759
more difficult and it is necessary to be

314
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:06,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the uap in order to</font>

315
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:12,610
follow a master device and slave devices

316
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:14,499
throughout throughout the afh map if

317
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:17,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody wants to talk about that after</font>

318
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:20,559

321
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:31,059
my in my talk here so ultimately as

322
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:33,129
awesome as uber tooth one was I had

323
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:36,059
little success sniffing traffic between

324
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:39,730
the mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> device and the light bulb and</font>

325
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:41,829
this was because the manufacturer of the

326
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,449
light bulb kind of tweaked the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth</font>

327
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:47,410
protocol and I think they did this via

328
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:49,779
the via the application so it's not it's

329
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a standard implementation of how</font>

330
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:55,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bluetooth would normally be I remember</font>

331
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing research in my apartment I netflix</font>

332
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:59,339
on in the background<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i got crazy</font>

333
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,329
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic when i was running a</font>

334
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,670
capture but it was from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my playstation</font>

335
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:09,789
controller I was like yeah I did

336
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:12,188
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> no so I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of bummed out</font>

337
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:13,779
there I was like all right well how<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

338
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:17,350
do I figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this traffic looks</font>

339
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:19,929
like exactly and then Android came to

340
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:22,230
the rescue so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically the</font>

341
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:24,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">equivalent of cheating in my mind</font>

342
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,829
developer mode on Android you just

343
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:28,960
enable developer mode and you have the

344
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:32,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to sniff Bluetooth traffic off</font>

345
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,380
the bluetooth interface on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Android</font>

346
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:37,539
device so it was as simple as enabling

347
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,250
developer mode clicking capture

348
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:41,470
Bluetooth traffic going back to the

349
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:44,200
application sending commands

350
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,610
kill the traffic capture and then spit

351
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">it back or pull it off the phone</font>

352
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:50,678
actually in this case using adb which is

353
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:53,260
a fantastic tool for<font color="#E5E5E5"> android developers</font>

354
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,669
the Android debug bridge just pulled

355
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that off the phone and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then I opened the</font>

356
00:17:54,669 --> 00:18:00,970
traffic in wireshark and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able to</font>

357
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:02,710
see exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was being sent to the</font>

358
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:08,559
light bulb and how the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices were</font>

359
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:11,500
communicating so the last piece of the

360
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:15,879
puzzle well was using<font color="#CCCCCC"> blues blues is the</font>

361
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:17,679
Bluetooth stack for linux and there's

362
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,919
kind of two two pieces to the puzzle

363
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,720
here HCI tool can be thought of as kind

364
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:26,799
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Swiss Army knife of the blues</font>

365
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,020
package it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> HCI tool allows</font>

366
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:32,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">you to communicate via the host</font>

367
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:34,929
controller port interface to two

368
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:36,520
different Bluetooth devices and then

369
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:39,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's gat tool which stands for</font>

370
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:42,879
generic<font color="#CCCCCC"> attribute tool which basically</font>

371
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:45,280
allows you to utilize terminal get tools

372
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,809
just to use the terminal to use your

373
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:53,168
Bluetooth interface on your linux

374
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:55,330
machine so without without any more

375
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:57,220
explanation we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at I guess</font>

376
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,559
we can look at the Wireshark traffic

377
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:02,860
quick so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys can understand how how</font>

378
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:04,658
easy it actually was and then we'll make

379
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:09,000
the light flicker a little bit and talk

380
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:11,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">about some some ramifications what what</font>

381
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,990
what could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done with that all right</font>

382
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">we got to increase that</font>

383
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,330
um

384
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,889
Oh

385
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:32,469


386
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:48,820
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit better so</font>

387
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:51,140
wireshark BTE what is it BTW cool

388
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i apologize for this being</font>

389
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:58,220
difficult to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll try to i'll do my</font>

390
00:19:53,240 --> 00:20:00,530
best to explain it so we can see our

391
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,090
local host being our machine or in this

392
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:04,340
case actually this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> android device</font>

393
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:08,300
and then our remote host being the light

394
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:11,840
bulb if we go down here to the

395
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:14,600
bluetooths a tribute protocol you can

396
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,300
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is it uses the right</font>

397
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:20,300
opcode so we're writing we're sending a

398
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:22,240
command to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> light bulb we have a</font>

399
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:25,010
handle the handle can be thought of as

400
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,550
identifier for which attribute you want

401
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:30,350
to modify<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i assume to e is</font>

402
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:32,750
basically a specifying that we're going

403
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:35,060
to change the color attribute something

404
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:38,870
of that nature and then you can specify

405
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:40,820
the value that you're going to value

406
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:45,110
you're sending to the light bulb in this

407
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:48,139
case I believe CC 2433 is off so that's

408
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:49,429
me turning the light bulb off will kill

409
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:57,020
Wireshark here and we'll play<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

410
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:59,810
light bulb a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so we'll</font>

411
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:05,629
do sudo actually yeah we'll just go

412
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:08,260
we'll go<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it so don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> HDI tool at</font>

413
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,260
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

414
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,870
I can't type in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

415
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright</font>

416
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:30,290
oh look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth devices so</font>

417
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,720
clearly one of them is the light bulb

418
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:35,000
out a couple of other people popping in

419
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,320
here so we have where this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:08,610
clearly have our light bulb now we're

the ability to char right under get

commands we can send char right which we

432
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:45,860
saw in our Wireshark our Wireshark

433
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:47,830
packet capture which are right we also

434
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the ability to char read which in</font>

435
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:52,639
future work I plan curious as to what

436
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,879
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> read from the light bulb or what</font>

437
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,990
what the light bulb has for you to read

438
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:01,190
read back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you we have char right and</font>

439
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,049
then we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go down here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

440
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:08,059
characteristics our value descriptor

441
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:11,658
read them right and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have our our tech</font>

442
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:16,190
a specifies our handle and tech and is

443
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:21,590
the value we're sending across so we can

444
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:22,820
go get tool actually def be for our

445
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:31,010
Bluetooth address that we're utilizing

446
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:34,908
here and dash dash<font color="#CCCCCC"> char-char right tech</font>

447
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:42,379
a four-hour handle value which was<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 X</font>

448
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:45,669
near 0 02 E and then I believe CC 2 333

449
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,669
should turn it on

450
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:51,230
bummer missing a tea

451
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:58,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">a value is required oh forgot the tech n</font>

452
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:12,740
oh let me get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out my do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have I do my</font>

453
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:14,180
list of fun commands so my last command

454
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put in if you have like any</font>

455
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:21,470
thoughts about epilepsy or anything like

456
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:23,840
that don't look at the light bulb so

457
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,010
yeah you can utilizing that we're able

458
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,949
to do fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you know what I mean</font>

459
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:37,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go through and we can change</font>

460
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:42,230
change colors 560 d 2 0 FF 0f good call

461
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:48,929
appreciate it now change it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and oak then</font>

462
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:51,720
change it<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 6 15 20</font>

463
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,710
so you know what instead of failing I'm

464
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,150
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to stick to the Simple</font>

465
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:58,890
commands will make it stroke right now

466
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:14,580
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go through and you can do</font>

467
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:19,430
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like modify</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3bb 3810 for for not</font>

468
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:19,429
changing huh turn right

469
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:25,189
there we go it just took<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a minute</font>

470
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:26,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting normally it's right away so</font>

471
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,869
you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do things like</font>

472
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:31,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">that now there's no reason that any</font>

473
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:33,379
person with epilepsy should probably

474
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:36,139
have these in their house let alone an

475
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:39,769
entire piconet of these but you could

476
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:41,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">imagine some some this is this is</font>

477
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:45,109
stretch but health ramifications of

478
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:47,299
Johnny black hat downstairs if your if

479
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:50,869
your device isn't paired with the

480
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:52,819
piconet of light bulbs he pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

481
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:55,069
has free<font color="#CCCCCC"> reign to right right to these</font>

482
00:25:52,819 --> 00:26:02,119
and and change their color and make them

483
00:25:55,069 --> 00:26:06,908
strobe and things of that nature 3600 to

484
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:06,908
440 that's too much

485
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:11,289
244

486
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:18,129
like that's intense you know that me but

487
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:23,200
everybody who wants this now is ready to

488
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:25,840
party exactly so that that's a that's

489
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,870
kind of where I had come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a standstill</font>

490
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:32,230
on my research amongst now now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

491
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:33,610
the capability to well I'm much busier

492
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:36,340
now that I'm working and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in school</font>

493
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:37,990
but now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the capability to fuzz</font>

494
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,760
commands to the light bulb you know what

495
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,470
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> see kind of test the boundaries</font>

496
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,980
test the waters of what works and what

497
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:49,240
doesn't and as I had said it'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

498
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:51,760
interesting to see what what is on the

499
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,350
light bulb that you can read back from

500
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:58,779
it for actually for all I know it may

501
00:26:53,350 --> 00:27:01,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">not be that interesting moving forward</font>

502
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:01,320
here

503
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:09,219
so wrapping this up here hopefully a

504
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:12,010
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> early much like that kitten</font>

505
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:14,780
snuggled in that blanket so awesomely

506
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:18,320
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT is here to stay it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

507
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:20,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">anywhere like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said it's already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

508
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,350
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and it's becoming more and</font>

509
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:30,850
more real as devices can connect

510
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:30,850
wirelessly to to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

511
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:43,399
and as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said our our job as members of</font>

512
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:46,099
the information security community is to

513
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:47,658
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that how is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security being</font>

514
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:50,749
implemented and is it being implemented

515
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:52,460
the right way so like I said the go out

516
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:54,739
and do research and if you find find

517
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,899
something interesting report it to the

518
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:59,269
people developing the product and make

519
00:27:56,899 --> 00:28:01,248
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's not not a cool</font>

520
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:05,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero-day in your fridge or something</font>

521
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:07,129
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so also I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bluetooth</font>

522
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:10,929
does a good job of implementing security

523
00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:13,879
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced frequency hopping and</font>

524
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:17,659

00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:19,369
interaction before devices pair with<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

526
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:21,769
another I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a</font>

527
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:24,559
good job over<font color="#CCCCCC"> there on the Bluetooth</font>

528
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:26,749
protocol and yeah the Internet of Things

529
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:31,339
is bringing new and exciting attack

530
00:28:26,749 --> 00:28:36,619
vectors to to our everyday<font color="#E5E5E5"> lives so to</font>

my target<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience go hack something all</font>

532
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:42,678
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things now exist thanks to Josh</font>

533
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:46,070
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth paper thanks Josh for</font>
