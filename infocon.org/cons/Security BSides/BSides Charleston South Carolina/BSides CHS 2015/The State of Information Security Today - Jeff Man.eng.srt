27
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,289
going to talk a little bit about Who I

want you to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the great things</font>

32
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,040
I've done in my career but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sort of</font>

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,539
the the premise of this talk is I've

34
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">been in the security business for quite</font>

35
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:52,450
a long time and especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> within with</font>

36
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:55,420
what we call<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security today sort</font>

37
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,490
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interweb and all that it's</font>

38
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,880
been going on for about 20-some years

39
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:03,880
and I got my<font color="#CCCCCC"> start as we'll see in a few</font>

40
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,100
slides about 20 years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a pen</font>

41
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:10,359
tester I was asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give a talk</font>

42
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,790
earlier this year and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk</font>

43
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,860
I've been giving it quite a bit

44
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,560
it was I<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave this talk in San Antonio</font>

45
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">back in February and it occurred to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

46
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,069
as I was putting this talk together it

47
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,560
had been 20 years since i first went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

48
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:24,238
San Antonio<font color="#E5E5E5"> to visit at the time an</font>

49
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,510
organization called the air force

50
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,530
information warfare center which which

51
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,810
at the time was sort of the premier

52
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,370
information security unit for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the for</font>

53
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,470
the Department of Defense so I went

54
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,629
there to learn but I'm getting ahead of

55
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,090
myself that's I've got slides and pretty

56
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:44,849
pictures stuff to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm</font>

57
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk about security today again</font>

58
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:50,760
i put this talk together mostly because

59
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,870
as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> old-timer security professional</font>

60
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,518
<font color="#E5E5E5">when looking at all the breaches that</font>

61
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,329
have been in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> news the last year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

62
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,669
two kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of got me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> soul-searching really</font>

63
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:01,200
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> chi are we really doing things</font>

64
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:04,439
right are we really doing anything

65
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,149
better today than we have been 20-some

66
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,799
years ago so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

67
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,389
bit about why we're failing i'm going to

68
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about the solution i will tell you</font>

69
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:14,310
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to do to do security right</font>

70
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:18,379
and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changes we need to</font>

71
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:20,909
make and hopefully that will spur some

72
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:24,569
some discussions we can have some QA

73
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:28,379
time towards the end so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been in the</font>

74
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:30,238
<font color="#E5E5E5">business a long time 30-some years spent</font>

75
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:33,929
sort of the first third of my career

76
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,760
within the DoD and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been out in the</font>

77
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,329
commercial sector for almost 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

78
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,548
now started out as a pen tester back in

79
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:44,010
the.com crazed and did vulnerability

80
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:45,750
assessments and security architecture

81
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,760
work basically I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a consultant hired</font>

82
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,739
gun to come in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> help companies figure</font>

83
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,649
out where their insecurities were where

84
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,599
their vulnerabilities were very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar</font>

85
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,979
if you went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the afternoon keynote the</font>

86
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:59,850
type of work that's still being done

87
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:02,790
today and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then somewhere along the line</font>

88
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:06,900
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> lifestyle caught up with me and I was</font>

89
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:09,329
sent to<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI purgatory PCI's the payment</font>

90
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,130
card industry and I've been I spent 10

91
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,010
years as a qualified security assessor

92
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:16,170
or q SI so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy that was called</font>

93
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:21,300
to come in and do the the PCI audits

94
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:24,150
compliance audits my DoD background I

95
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:27,990
actually got started at the National

96
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">Security Agency as a crypt analyst and I</font>

97
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,100
was in<font color="#CCCCCC"> what was called the manual</font>

98
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">cryptosystems shop the most secure</font>

99
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,730
crypto system in the world that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cannot</font>

100
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:40,140
be broken is a one-time pad started with

101
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,000
that i was in an office that was

102
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,760
producing one-time pads and other types

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,980
of paper manual type crypto systems

104
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,719
which came in handy years later when i

105
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,910
became a pen tester and wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

106
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,010
things like password cracking and stuff

107
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:58,560
like that so there was a tie in there

108
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:00,390
spent some time at NSA on what's called

109
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,250
the operations side of the house the

110
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:04,229
offensive side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the house what most</font>

111
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,550
people know NSA for intersected

112
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:11,040
intercepting the communications of other

113
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,560
adversarial countries and if you believe

114
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the news recently also our closest</font>

00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,090
desert storm which was that small

117
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,490
skirmish that we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years before</font>

118
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,590
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> longest war we've ever had which is</font>

119

120
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:31,890
now but then I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> into an intern</font>

121
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,690
program as a crypt analysts and ended up

122
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,610
back on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the defensive side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the house</font>

123
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,920
what we call it at the time information

00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,850
security or<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec which is now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

127
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:50,550
formed to do ethical hacking what we

128
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:56,070
called a red teaming and was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of in</font>

129
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:58,050
at the ground floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that for NSA this</font>

130
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,810
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a hacker techie crowd I</font>

131
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,419
wanted to

132
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">own a few extra slides at the very</font>

beginning of my career one of the first

pretty much my first project was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

approached by a customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

a traditional<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-time pad and they said</font>

00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,400
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got these computers on our desk</font>

isn't there some way<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

do this encryption decryption process

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,150
rather than spend hours writing it down

141
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:25,180
on paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> now these were case agents that</font>

142
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:27,090
were comfortably in allied territory but

143
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,710
they were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> with people that were</font>

144
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:32,979
what we would call spies or turned

145
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:35,289
agents that were back in those days in

146
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:37,539
the Soviet Union<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they would have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

147
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,400
one-time pad fit in the heel of their

148
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,410
shoe and they'd have to sneak their

149
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,960
messages in and out but the guy in the

150
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:46,479
office had a big tablet he had lots of

151
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,090
luxury to lots of space to<font color="#CCCCCC"> write but</font>

152
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">even then it took him hours to just</font>

153
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:53,888
create these messages or to decrypt

154
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,740
these messages so we came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

155
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:58,750
project<font color="#CCCCCC"> of turning a one-time pad into</font>

156
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we call it a one-time floppy we put</font>

157
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,280
the key and the digits and the

158
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,229
characters that are written<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

159
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,960
one-time pad or key just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you can</font>

160
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:09,909
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about key today the key is used to</font>

161
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,669
combine with plain text to produce a

162
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:14,410
code we put it on a floppy disk to my

163
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:16,450
knowledge it was the first computer

164
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,729
based crypto system that NSA ever

165
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,979
produced and they really didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like us</font>

166
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:24,820
doing it because NSA was<font color="#E5E5E5"> all about</font>

167
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:27,159
building little<font color="#E5E5E5"> black boxes and one of</font>

168
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,450
my first<font color="#E5E5E5"> advisors there said well you</font>

169
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,630
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there really is no such thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

170
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:34,270
software all we do is firmware so anyway

171
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:36,909
moved on one of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things I did</font>

172
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:40,030
was some similar type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> activity only</font>

173
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:43,030
this was for US Special Forces they also

174
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:45,309
used paper the one of the 18 members or

175
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,380
the Delta Force members would carry a

176
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,200
backpack<font color="#E5E5E5"> with about 40 pounds of paper</font>

177
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,760
they used a separate<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-time pad for</font>

178
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,500
sending message and they used a separate

179
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,300
one for receiving messages and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they</font>

180
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,539
had another set of paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> pads that gave</font>

181
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,620
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> the call signs the the</font>

182
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:01,568
authentication that they use to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

183
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,759
is a legitimate and

184
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:05,949
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the process of converting</font>

185
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,809
what they called their their base

186
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:13,559
stations their communications base

187
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:15,819
stations to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run on laptops and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

188
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:18,819
saving them a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of space a lot of</font>

189
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:20,979
performance upkeep but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again they needed</font>

190
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:22,659
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the the key that was essentially</font>

191
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:25,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">produced put on a floppy disk which is</font>

192
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:27,938
what we did for them the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

193
00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:30,039
Special Forces<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys used it was their</font>

194
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:31,539
algorithm algorithm if you will is

195
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:34,120
something called a Visionnaire square

196
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:37,179
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is simply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the 26 slides of the</font>

197
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,269
alphabet against itself and by doing

198
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:42,338
that you create unique three character

199
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:45,279
combinations or what we call try graphs

200
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:47,529
and it turns out that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do this</font>

201
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,509
there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 123 unique try</font>

202
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:51,370
graphs that are formed and the Special

203
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:52,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">Forces guys would memorize them so when</font>

204
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,120
they were encrypting and decrypting it

205
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,130
they're doing it all in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their head I was</font>

206
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,259
working with them drying to help help

207
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,730
them work on these systems and I didn't

208
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:02,529
have that memorized so I just came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

209
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">with this little I just been through the</font>

210
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:06,790
crypto 101 history classes and learned

211
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:08,470
about cipher wheels so I said there must

212
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:12,819
be a way to make a cipher wheel that

213
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:14,709
does the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> visioneer thing and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font>

214
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:17,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">it I came up with one first one I made</font>

215
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:19,989
was on graph paper right I rubber

216
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:21,880
cemented it today remember rubber cement

217
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,160
was the last time you saw rubber cement

218
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,199
do they still make it was thing about

219
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,089
that the other day I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on cardboard</font>

220
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:30,310
I put a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> acorn pin and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it cut it</font>

221
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:32,259
out so I took it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me the next time I</font>

222
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:35,050
went out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a special forces unit to</font>

223
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:37,240
talk to him and do some training i turn

224
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:39,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">my back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the people to write on a</font>

225
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,899
whiteboard turn around<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things gone</font>

226
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,459
they were stealing it from me<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I made</font>

227
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:44,589
some more bring them out they kept

228
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:46,209
stealing it from so we finally broke

229
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:47,829
down said would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like us to make some</font>

230
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:49,839
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things for you so we produced</font>

231
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:52,930
like 15,000 of them and sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> them out</font>

232
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:55,630
and you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was like in the late</font>

233
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,519
80s and up until the last couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

234
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:00,069
in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier this year I gave this</font>

235
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,839
talk and somebody afterwards came up to

236
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:04,089
me and says I didn't know you made that

237
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,850
thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got one of those so I always</font>

238
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:08,829
will run<font color="#E5E5E5"> into you former Special Forces</font>

239
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,510
guys or I think they used them a little

240
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:11,640
bit in the state

241
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,220
department but they came to call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

242
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">wizzy wheel so if ever if I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever meet a</font>

243
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,510
special forces guy asking if they've

244
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,690
heard of a whizzy wheel nine times out

245
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:23,250
of ten they have and I tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them that I</font>

246
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,840
invented<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and they either hit me at</font>

247
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,650
that point or they buy me a drink so

248
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:30,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's kind of cool anyway for a while I</font>

249
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,370
was a crypt analyst and I was really

250
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">excited two summers ago Wired magazine</font>

251
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:38,160
put out an article talking about some

252
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,890
guy at CIA headquarters it solves

253
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,930
cracked the code of this statue it

254
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,490
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really show up too well here has</font>

255
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,650
anybody heard that this is called the

256
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:50,220
crypto statue it's in the courtyard at

257
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:52,079
CIA headquarters so early in 2013 they

258
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,420
had an<font color="#E5E5E5"> article saying that this guy at</font>

259
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,370
CIA headquarters had broken it tediously

260
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,260
over like 10 years and then a few months

261
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:01,590
later this article that came out and

262
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,870
said a bunch of NSA interns had taken it

263
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,940
the code down and broke taking it back

264
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,650
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> headquarters and broken it years</font>

265
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,350
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> this guy from CIA headquarters</font>

266
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:12,630
had done it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happy to say I was</font>

267
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,070
actually one of those interns it's one

268
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">of my favorite stories that I never got</font>

269
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:20,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> until Wired magazine put it out</font>

270
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:22,680
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public realm but we were kind of</font>

271
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:26,060
offended that this statue was at CIA

272
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:29,459
because NSA is the crypto agency not CIA

273
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,900
so anyway we did take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it back and they</font>

274
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually in the article they had a copy</font>

275
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the memo I had forgotten it but there</font>

276
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,840
is a memo written by light the director

277
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,069
saying okay you guys can work on this

278
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,350
but don't do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on company time</font>

279
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:42,180
basically and don't use any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

280
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,190
company hardware you know all the super

281
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,410
mainframes that we have that do all the

282
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:50,970
statistical stuff so we basically had to

283
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:53,459
break it on all by hand so that statute

284
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,710
contains four separate messages three of

285
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,420
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> were broken rather quickly nobody</font>

286
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,700
has ever broken the fourth one it's not

287
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,949
very long so it's harder to break when

288
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have less traffic to work with so to</font>

289
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:06,240
this day the fourth message has never

290
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,940
been broken so the entire message that

291
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sculptor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the artist that created the</font>

292
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,900
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never had his entire</font>

293
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,449
solution reveal he'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably take it</font>

294
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:18,270
to his grave I don't know

295
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:19,890
anyway that's my days at NSA doing fun

296
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,650
stuff and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ended up getting into</font>

297
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:26,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">pentesting and vulnerability assessments</font>

298
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:28,470
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also fun stuff i mentioned that</font>

299
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,949
i went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a Frick 20 years ago and that</font>

300
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:34,350
was sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the genesis of this talk</font>

301
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:36,120
back then we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really call it red</font>

302
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,970
teaming<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that term came along a</font>

303
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,650
few years later but we do call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

304
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,720
penetration testing we talked to about

305
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:47,130
having penetration envy and it's all

306
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,240
sorts of fun stuff like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

307
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:52,080
the last things that happened while<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

308
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,640
was at NSA we were we were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

309
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,550
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> work for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Department of Justice</font>

310
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:59,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">in fact I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I just printed up some of</font>

311
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:01,380
these some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the letters in the</font>

312
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:05,880
correspondence between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Department of</font>

313
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:08,220
Justice an organization called DISA the

314
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:12,480
defense information systems agency and

315
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:14,430
NSA in this I'll share this just because

316
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,380
it sort of makes it sort of sounds like

317
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:21,239
the whole it's related to the whole

318
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:24,420
Snowden thing in that NSA is not

319
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,910
chartered to do what NSA does or at

320
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,579
least historically wasn't to u.s.

321
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:31,560
citizens us entities so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of</font>

322
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,930
ethical hacking or red teaming or pen

323
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,660
testing you know for all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

324
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:38,489
benefits for NSA to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

325
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,520
that was kind of not something that we

326
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:43,740
did so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had this month's long process</font>

327
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,930
of getting all sorts of special

328
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:49,730
permissions and everybody had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> review</font>

329
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:51,420
it and lawyers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the set the other and</font>

330
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,400
basically the Department of Justice

331
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,170
wanted us to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to do some pen</font>

332
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,550
testing of their networks to tell them

333
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,319
what their vulnerabilities were and it

334
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,819
we were about six months into<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

335
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,640
the authorizations and we were this

336
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,950
close to getting all the signatures and

337
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,360
all the permission when I got a call one

338
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,190
day of saying we've been hacked and

339
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,660
their website was defaces anybody even

340
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:13,620
remember this it was one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the early</font>

341
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:17,400
ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to say it was in August of</font>

342
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,810
1996 Janet Reno was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Attorney General</font>

343
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,779
they replaced her

00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:24,150
picture of the picture of Adolf Hitler

345
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:26,670
they had a link to the Playboy page

346
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:28,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">playboy.com was brand new everything was</font>

347
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:30,930
brand new back then of course they put

348
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,670
the swastika up I don't know if you can

349
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,199
read I don't even<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember what George</font>

350
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,939
Washington said I think he said

351
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,310
something about I'm rolling over my

352
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,970

353
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:44,400
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world today anyway so I was</font>

354
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,529
involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in early forensics exercises i</font>

355
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:53,329
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> Snowden because we actually</font>

356
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:55,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">got in trouble with our own lawyers</font>

357
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:58,020
general counsel because they were very

358
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,820
concerned about we were doing this thing

359
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,260
that NSA isn't allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do even though</font>

360
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,020
we thought we had all the permissions

361
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,819
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> paperwork and he mentioned you</font>

362
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had this thing called the church</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">act haven't you ever heard of the church</font>

364
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,670
act he might have violated it you could

365
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:13,920
get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> director thrown in jail and so</font>

366
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,510
on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth the only other time I've</font>

367
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,290
ever heard about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the church act in</font>

368
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:20,790
history is when Snowden did his thing

369
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:23,189
they cited<font color="#CCCCCC"> the church act and the church</font>

370
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:25,680
act was basically NSA did some things

371
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,600
during the Watergate hearings the time

372
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,060
of the Watergate break-in doing

373
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,250
surveillance on US citizens and some

374
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:35,609
congressman named church called him out

375
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:38,490
on it and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Crete you know created an</font>

376
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:41,600
act a law that said specifically NSA

377
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:43,800
don't do what NSA does to u.s. citizens

378
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,960
have I bored you yet because I haven't

379
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,819
even gotten to my talk yet anyway so I

380
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,440
got out<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the private sector I spent</font>

381
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first couple years doing consulting</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">tack and penetration testing which</font>

383
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,600
really turned into vulnerability

384
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,339
assessment which really turned into

385
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,080
security program architecture and

386
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:00,390
development because nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> was ready for</font>

387
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,360
a pen test back then as the gentleman

388
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:05,400
earlier was talking about and somehow I

435
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,940
in the news in the mid-2000s hopefully

436
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,500
you recognize some of those names not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

439
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,170
I've had kind of a unique experience

440
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,570
because there aren't a whole lot of

441
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:21,299
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the world that can say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well we</font>

00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:45,840
again I kind of started off writing this

you know 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> years into it what happens</font>

454
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,119
we got these<font color="#E5E5E5"> major breaches and you know</font>

455
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:56,158
I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to update this with the</font>

459
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:06,450
but what's working you know phishing

460
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:08,879
attacks are working we still have issues

461
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,799
with passwords not only weak passwords

462
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:13,949
but shared passwords and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only shared</font>

466
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:23,999
we're in the pen<font color="#CCCCCC"> testing business and</font>

467
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:26,639
then you know you know to add insult to

468
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:29,460
injury some of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

469
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:31,258
relied on for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 years as the building</font>

470
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,600
blocks and the tools we use things like

471
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:35,220
the bash shell turns out it has

472
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,359
vulnerabilities in it that are 20 years

473
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:41,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">old and what's what's different today</font>

474
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:43,649
technology is obviously a lot faster

475
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:46,590
we're not just looking at hard wired

476
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:48,299
networks anymore you know we're looking

477
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,340
at virtual networks we're looking at

478
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:52,109
everything's moving to the cloud now and

479
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:55,019
you know we're passing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the buck on to a</font>

480
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:56,609
cloud provider and trusting them to be

481
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:59,249
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure because that's the business</font>

482
00:19:56,609 --> 00:20:02,850
they're in so we're outsourcing a lot of

483
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:04,470
this it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> sit well with me I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

484
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:07,549
know how it sits with you guys but it

485
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:09,600
just kind of makes me a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> concerned</font>

486
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:11,399
you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

487
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,350
motivations of the bad guys what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

488
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:15,070
threats today whether you call them

489
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,699
hackers or not or

490
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:21,039
if you get hung up on the names but you

491
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,110
know obviously they figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a way to</font>

492
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,519
monetize the data that they're stealing

493
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:26,949
that's probably first and foremost

494
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:29,799
whether they're doing it for you know

495
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,630
political activism hacktivism or just

496
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:33,129
simply to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a buck you know the</font>

497
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:37,149
threat is real and it's certainly out

498
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:38,649
there and you as a pet as a former pen

499
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:40,508
tester and what I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to tell my</font>

500
00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:42,908
customers they've got infinitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

501
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:45,279
resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> and time to do what they do</font>

502
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:47,080
than what you're giving us in terms of

503
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:49,450
time to try to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's wrong</font>

504
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">and try to protect it so it's sort of</font>

505
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:54,039
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> deck is stacked in the favor of</font>

506
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:59,649
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad guy if you will so why are we</font>

507
00:20:54,039 --> 00:21:03,370
failing this is a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit my opinion</font>

508
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:04,809
but I think it's I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe in my opinion</font>

509
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:07,389
because I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business so</font>

510
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:10,450
long but I think overall in this

511
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:13,889
industry or in in in the business world

512
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:16,389
there's this over reliance on technology

513
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:18,580
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you know companies don't have</font>

514
00:21:16,389 --> 00:21:20,199
the skills and the training they don't

515
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,820
have the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one of the</font>

516
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">buzzwords around the industry these days</font>

517
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,210
the hacker community the security

518
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,070
community there's a labor shortage

519
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:29,620
there's not enough people out there that

520
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:32,049
know what they're doing so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

521
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:35,709
for for many reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a reliance</font>

522
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:37,269
on technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you might have heard</font>

523
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,919
it said that there's no such thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

524
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:41,289
silver bullet solution and I believe

525
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:43,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I ascribe to that but what</font>

526
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:45,700
companies have done too often is they've

527
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:47,199
gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and bought every silver bullet</font>

528
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,629
they can find so they end up with all

529
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,360
magazine full of silver bullets and so

530
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:54,459
they have all these things and they

531
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,168
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> makes them secure now this</font>

532
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,210
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit biased because it's</font>

533
00:21:56,169 --> 00:21:59,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">just strictly because I've had PCI on</font>

534
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:02,169
the brain for so long this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of a</font>

535
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,909
list of things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need for PCI</font>

536
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:06,309
compliance to cover all the different

537
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:08,409
security requirements but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20</font>

538
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:10,090
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago when people were starting to</font>

539
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:11,919
people companies were starting to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

540
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,928
the internet it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was we have to have a</font>

541
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,879
firewall and shortly after that is what

542
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:17,200
you need to have intrusion detection or

543
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:18,750
you need to have a pen test where you

544
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to have</font>

545
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,140
vulnerability scanning where you need to

546
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,760
have you know what is it today<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big</font>

547
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,500
one is a sim solution you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

548
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,210
encrypt your data you need to have two

549
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,040
factor authentication you need this<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

550
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,360
need that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need this and companies</font>

551
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,129
buy it they go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and buy all this</font>

552
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,139
stuff and that where does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that leave</font>

553
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,880
them I don't know but companies big

554
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:43,630
companies are still getting hacked and

555
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:45,190
still getting breached so what makes the

556
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:49,780
network's insecure to my way of thinking

557
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:52,600
is is sort of a combination of they've

558
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">got all this stuff but very often and</font>

559
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,949
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen this time and time again as</font>

560
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:59,559
I've gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> into customers and ask them</font>

561
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:03,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the strategy here they don't</font>

562
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:06,580
know they don't they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have a</font>

563
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:08,980
written information security policy and

564
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,678
by that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a plan</font>

565
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">they don't have a strategy very often</font>

566
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,410
companies they know they need to do

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they haven't really</font>

568
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought out what is it I'm trying to</font>

569
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:23,200
protect and where is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and to what</font>

00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:24,910
degree do I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect it you can</font>

571
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:29,200
argue whether compliance programs are

572
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:31,480
good or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the PCI again as an</font>

573
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,190
example has has done nothing if else

574
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,510
taken a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of companies that</font>

575
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,760
wouldn't ordinarily have done a whole

576
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:39,250
lot for security in general and they

577
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,230
breathe they forced them to become more

578
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,330
secure just because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've forced them</font>

579
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:46,270
to understand a little bit more what's

580
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:48,520
going on in their environment and that's

581
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:50,200
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the push of PCI these days you</font>

582
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:53,590
know so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a gimmick to get out of the</font>

583
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,270
business<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pci by d scoping things but</font>

584
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:57,129
to d scope things you have to know where

585
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:59,170
things are so there's sort of this

586
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:01,480
inverse relationship and there's this

587
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:03,910
hidden benefit whether it's intentional

588
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,250
or not of if you want to if you want to

589
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,960
remove the scrutiny of PCI you've got to

590
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:10,150
identify all the sensitive data in your

591
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,190
network and either remove it or isolate

592
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:14,050
it to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have to understand</font>

593
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:15,550
where it is so all these companies that

594
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:18,010
are trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the business of</font>

596
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:22,390
are cleaning up their network and ten

00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">years ago 11 years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when we first</font>

started<font color="#E5E5E5"> out doing PCI stuff the data was</font>

599
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:29,110
everywhere and it wasn't encrypted

600
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,570
and it was walking out<font color="#CCCCCC"> every day on</font>

601
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,760
laptops by conscientious people trying

602
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:35,560
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do work at home and they're plugging</font>

603
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,370
into their home networks and so on and

604
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:41,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">so forth I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about the lack of</font>

605
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:44,169
commitment<font color="#E5E5E5"> to security it's almost like</font>

606
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:45,820
a you know what's it's almost like

607
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:47,080
ignorance and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost like apathy</font>

608
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,450
and everybody knows the difference

609
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:53,050
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> ignorance and apathy I don't</font>

610
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:55,260
know what I don't care you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

611
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:58,300
depending on what industry you're in

612
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:00,460
yeah pci is an example they only do what

613
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,710
they have to do because pci tells him to

614
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,290
do and they try to limit it you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

615
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:06,880
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care community some of the</font>

616
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:08,740
big breaches this year were<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care</font>

617
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,630
companies if you read the articles about

00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,160
what was stolen it wasn't technically

619

<font color="#E5E5E5">health care information that was stolen</font>

doing all the right things doing

624
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:24,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything they had to do but somehow</font>

625
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,649
these companies collectively were

626
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,920
missing the ball on they still had

627
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:31,630
sensitive data and they weren't

628
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,040
protecting it in a way that needed to be

629
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,380
protected because they weren't looking

630
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">at it from a different perspective so</font>

631
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all ties back to you know what's</font>

632
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:40,750
your game plan what's your strategy what

633
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:43,120
is it you're trying to protect and why

634
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:45,130
and of course I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about</font>

635
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">decentralized administration I don't</font>

636
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,740
know if you guys work for commercial

637
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,690
companies or if you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

638
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:54,370
consulting companies advisory companies

639
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:57,280
but you've probably are familiar with

640
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:59,280
silos and how different groups are not

641
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,840
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one another within companies</font>

642
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:04,360
and it happens within our industry as

643
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,310
well I would very<font color="#CCCCCC"> often go in to do a</font>

644
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,050
PCI assessment and you have to talk

645
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:10,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the firewalls in the network so</font>

646
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,830
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to the network guys and you get</font>

647
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,510
the network architecture you get the

648
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:15,010
wire diagram and you find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

649
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything is and then you'd ask them</font>

650
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:18,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well we're all the sensitive</font>

651
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:19,660
servers and where's all the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

652
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they shrug their shoulders</font>

653
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:23,050
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know I just set up the</font>

654
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:25,120
network I don't know what the I don't

655
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,379
know where the sensitive zones are so

656
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,939
then you have to go to the server guys

657
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,440
to find out how the servers are being

658
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,070
built ins so you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to talk to the</font>

659
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,380
UNIX guys and

660
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:35,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah maybe it's the Linux guys or maybe</font>

661
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,639
it's the windows servers you know it was

662
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,320
a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of people and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

663
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,639
to them about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they're building the</font>

664
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,490
server is how they're hardened during

665
00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:45,379
the OS and you they talk about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

666
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:46,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">day and then you say we will kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

667
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,840
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> apps are running on the</font>

668
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:49,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">servers what kind of data is on the</font>

669
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,549
servers right there<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font>

670
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:55,340
just I just keep the OS run so on and so

671
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:56,809
forth down the line<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dbas they talk</font>

672
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,850
all day about the scheme is in the

673
00:26:56,809 --> 00:27:00,678
structures the databases that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there that</font>

674
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're in charge of that start asking</font>

675
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:04,399
them about what kind of data is in the

676
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:07,100
databases I don't know I just set up the

677
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:09,049
scheme so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of willful</font>

678
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,549
ignorance is what i like to call it I'm

679
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:12,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">just doing my job I'm just staying</font>

680
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:14,059
within my lanes I'm doing what I'm

681
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,740
supposed to do my light is green so I

682
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:18,470
don't have to worry about it I think

683
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,149
those those all contribute to why some

684
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,769
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these big companies are failing and</font>

685
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:25,219
by failing I mean they're getting

686
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:28,509
breached so on the flip side of that

687
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:31,220
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that mean we need to be doing</font>

688
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:33,710
you know we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sell the idea of</font>

689
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:39,200
security better both as an industry in

690
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:42,230
both within companies you know and some

691
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,240
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these ideas and this is sort of a you</font>

692
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:46,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">know this is collection</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thoughts</font>

693
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,360
and my my impression is more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

694
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:52,669
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you know selling and</font>

695
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,469
selling the company's on you know what

696
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:56,269
are the financial losses or what are the

697
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:58,759
financial inefficiencies because usually

698
00:27:56,269 --> 00:28:00,799
it comes down to dollars and cents you

699
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:05,029
know you can save money if you do this

700
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:06,860
or you can theoretically save money by

701
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:09,830
preventing this from happening those

702
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,779
types of things when you start talking

703
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:13,070
money that's usually when the management

704
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:15,019
and the executives start to pay

705
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:16,850
attention and certainly when they see it

706
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:18,710
in the news having happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> to another</font>

707
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:21,289
company that's just like them or just

708
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:23,090
like you or just like us that's when

709
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:26,240
they start to listen

710
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:28,280
so what do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do what really</font>

711
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,210

712
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:35,290
problem I am more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more convinced</font>

713
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:38,380
that what really<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes a difference</font>

714
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:41,540
holistically is education and awareness

715
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,340
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be aware of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

716
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,740
security is all about what it isn't

717
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:48,889
isn't within<font color="#E5E5E5"> an organization and that</font>

718
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:52,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">ties into understanding that security is</font>

719
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:54,260
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a state that you achieve it's</font>

720
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:57,370
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you do I like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that</font>

721
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,990
security is a verb it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a noun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

722
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:02,719
understanding that means you're involved

723
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:07,190
necessarily in an ongoing<font color="#E5E5E5"> life cycle or</font>

724
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:10,460
process you as a company are are engaged

725
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:12,230
in this and how you begin to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be get</font>

726
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,720
secure his first understand where you

727
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:18,200
are in the life cycle and and then

728
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:21,760
proceed<font color="#CCCCCC"> from there and this is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meant</font>

729

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a speech on security but you know</font>

730
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,690
traditionally it starts with an

731
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,790
assessment where are you establish a

732
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:30,440
baseline where is the sensitive data

733
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:33,170
what are our<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical business</font>

where what have<font color="#E5E5E5"> we out sourced what do</font>

738
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:45,110
we own who's responsible who's liable

739
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:47,000
and take all that information then build

740
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:49,250
your strategy build your plan and write

741
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,440
it down that's necessary the policy

742
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,270
aspect of things and then build your

743
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,590
solutions based on that based on having

744
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:57,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">an idea of what you're dealing with</font>

745
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:59,659
based on having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a plan implement it for</font>

a while run with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and then test it</font>

747
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:04,160
that's when that dirty word audit comes

748
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:07,040
up audit is measuring what you're doing

749
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:09,740
against some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of set of rules or</font>

750
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:12,200
guidelines or standards people always

00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,970
talk call pci<font color="#CCCCCC"> and audit it's not an</font>

752
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,070
audit it's an assessment because it's

753
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,930
designed to have be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

professional qsa coming in and just

755
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:22,310
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a baseline of where you are now</font>

756
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:24,800
you do that several times that it starts

757
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:28,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look more like an audit but the the</font>

758
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,990
audit aspect of<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI is you should have a</font>

759
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,120
configuration standard for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

760
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:35,180
servers but PCI doesn't stipulate what

761
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,520
the standards are it says use one

762
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:39,770
so you have to come in and find out what

763
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:43,430
one are you using<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then measure it</font>

764
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:45,110
against<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and its ongoing as soon as</font>

765
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:47,180
you're done to auditing and it kind of

766
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:49,310
blurs between auditing and assessing

767
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,500
your you're constantly refining and

768
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:53,540
updating and new vulnerabilities are

769
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,190
exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that feed all this this is</font>

770
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:59,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">really in some ways the definition of a</font>

771
00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:02,650
risk assessment I have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what I'm</font>

772
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:06,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing for time and what's the time check</font>

773
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:13,130
Oh plenty 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 minutes okay plenty of</font>

774
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:15,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">time so intent having a system having a</font>

775
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:17,510
systematic approach having intention of

776
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:19,310
designing and understanding where you

777
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,980
are that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the heart of what I'm</font>

778
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:23,389
trying to say is what's needed and that

779
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:25,070
necessarily needs to be written down in

780
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:28,310
the sense of you don't need to have this

781
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:31,700
you know shelf full of documents or you

782
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:34,340
know a<font color="#CCCCCC"> file system full of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know PDFs</font>

783
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:36,560
of what your policy is and I used to see

784
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:38,720
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time pcr requires your</font>

785
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:41,210
policies to be reviewed annually so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

786
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,360
would very often come on site<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the 50</font>

787
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:46,340
documents had been reviewed one day the

788
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,990
week before I got there now all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

789
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,879
are one day had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> date yeah I</font>

790
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,830
knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they weren't really reviewing</font>

791
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,090
critically what the thing said and

792
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,760
updating it they're just changing the

793
00:31:53,090 --> 00:32:00,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">date and sometimes I let that slide that</font>

794
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:01,490
sometimes I wouldn't but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

795
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,440
understanding that you need to have it

796
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:05,750
written down I need to have it<font color="#CCCCCC"> embraced</font>

797
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,180
by your entire company to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

798
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:09,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">appropriate level ownership having</font>

799
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,420
everybody understand what their role is

800
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:13,820
and how they fit into everything and

801
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:16,700
then understanding ultimately that's not

802
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:18,379
just what technology solution is what

803
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,360
security solutions do we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have in</font>

804
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:25,130
place and then we can sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and say</font>

805
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:26,570
okay we're done we're protected so blow

806
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,980
through this what is an information

807
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,720
security policy have kind of been

808
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,330
describing and it's your plan it's your

809
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,280
strategy it's a way to justify

810
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:35,899
expenditures it's the way to decide if

811
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,490
you're investing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this or that you</font>

812
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:40,360
need one of these or three of these or

813
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:42,730
who gets what it's a way to go before

814
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,919
you're you know whoever your budget

815
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:47,860
committee is within your company to

816
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,929
justify not only the investments<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

817
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,699
technology is necessary don't get me

818
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:53,860
wrong I'm not saying you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't do it</font>

819
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,260
without technology but understand what

820
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:58,090
the role of the technology is understand

821
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:00,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the technology is ultimately a tool</font>

822
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:02,799
but a well-informed workforce and staff

823
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,600
especially within your IT guru your

824
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,290
security group is ultimately what

825
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:10,120
changes things but a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

826
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:12,100
well so Garrity<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bozzio that's just</font>

827
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:14,469
writing I mean if you're a developer how

828
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,879
how much do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you love documenting the</font>

829
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,860
code<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you write nobody likes to</font>

830
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">write stuff down I think that's a</font>

831
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:24,879
universal truth you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the early</font>

832
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,350
dude we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about policies and you</font>

833
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,510
know the firewall rule set in the early

834
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:30,969
days was referred to<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the firewall</font>

835
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:31,929
policy you know the configuration well

836
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,090
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what we're talking about</font>

837
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:36,880
we're talking about that overall guide

838
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:38,379
that overall strategy that dictates how

839
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:43,870
everything is accomplished and how

840
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:46,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything is implemented as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I said it a</font>

841
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:49,510
policy helps you build a business case

842
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:51,220
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies are businesses most</font>

843
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,960
businesses are run by people that

844
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,720
understand business and business

845
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,240
processes so putting the the need for

846
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,010
security within your company in the

847
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,400
language that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business people</font>

848
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:05,230
understand is key again you know the

849
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,540
compliance requirements really<font color="#CCCCCC"> help I</font>

850
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:09,159
used to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and just whisper hey I</font>

851
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,899
know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you what's wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with your</font>

852
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:12,850
network more than I do what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font>

853
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:14,799
because if I slap PCI oh and I guess

854
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:16,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you're going to get it and they're</font>

855
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,300
like really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm I can't really test me</font>

856
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:20,679
on this and so we test it and they'd get

857
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,409
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're like oh you're my best friend</font>

858
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:25,690
because i had this magic cape that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

859
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:27,220
said they needed something the

860
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:29,918
management didn't understand but they

861
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:32,500
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> pci we wanted to go away blank</font>

862
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,000
check you can have whatever you want so

863
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,980
that's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> trick you can do</font>

864
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,850
hopefully internally as well as if

865
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:41,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're</font>

866
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:42,279
in a consulting rule you know when you

867
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,650
have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> written down when you have a</font>

868
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,580
strategy when you have a framework

869
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:48,100
everything kind of runs more efficiently

870
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:51,190
and everything works better and things

871
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:53,080
start to happen and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't</font>

872
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:57,370
emphasize<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough it's not all about just</font>

873
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:59,799
throwing technology at the problem why

874
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,759
policy efforts fail because nobody does

875
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,850
everything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've just been</font>

876
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:07,900
describing basically that's my synopsis

877
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:10,210
of that trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moving the keys</font>

878
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:12,310
to success changing the corporate

879
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,720
culture I was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a healthcare</font>

880
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,950
crowd a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks ago and they were</font>

881
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,600
saying that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number one problem</font>

882
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:18,549
within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the healthcare industry is</font>

883
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,950
convincing doctors that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

884
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:22,180
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> password and they need to use it</font>

885
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they need to change it because</font>

886
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,810
doctors are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not accustomed to being told</font>

887
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:28,000
what to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so they've got this</font>

888
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:29,350
incredible culture problem within the

889
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,120
whole industry that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

890
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:32,529
shift they know they want to do they

891
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,359
know they need to they don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

892
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,250
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> anthem of the world that</font>

00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:39,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're still faced with this corporate</font>

894
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:41,080
culture this cultural problem of and we

895
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:44,379
don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's too hard</font>

896
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:46,660
or it's too inconvenient so there needs

897
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:51,760
to be buying from the top down a pita

898
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:53,529
delay the line employee the regular

899
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,480
workers within a company they need to

900
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:58,360
see it being done by their bosses and

901
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,370
their executives because if they're not

902
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:03,460
walking the walk they know oh it doesn't

903
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:05,920
really matter and you know that means

904
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:07,840
the CEO can't turn over his password and

905
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,420
his<font color="#E5E5E5"> email accounts or these days it</font>

906
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:12,400
would be his mobile device or tablet to

907
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,440
his secretary or is an executive

908
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,420
assistant and let her have access to it

909
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:20,470
and let her<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it all over the place</font>

910
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:23,440
and rely on her to keep it secure so on

911
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,700
and so forth so you know the first

912
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,050
question asked yourselves if you're

913
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,910
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a company or if you're</font>

914
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:30,280
advising companies is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to identify</font>

915
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:31,920
where you are within this life cycle so

916
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:37,260
you can proceed from there

917
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:39,930
they offer my<font color="#E5E5E5"> punchline the heart of</font>

918
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:43,260
this presentation that you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> just seen</font>

919
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:44,790
is verbatim a presentation i gave when i

920
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:48,450
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> came out into the commercial world</font>

921
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:50,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">18 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago haven't changed a thing</font>

922
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:55,500
threats and motives nothing's changed

923
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:57,000
life cycle nothing's changed so now I

924
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,760
ask you and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where we hopefully</font>

925
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,250
get into a conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and dialogue if</font>

926
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,420
nothing's really changed what needs to

927
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:08,340
change if and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

928
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,260
cornering the market on thinking this is

929
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,300
where security needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be 20 years ago</font>

930
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:15,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">but the industry was saying all of this</font>

931
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,550
20 years ago security practitioners have

932
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:22,050
been saying this all along nothing has

933
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:23,760
ever changed so again this is my

934
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:25,890
opinions and trying to summer up a lot

935
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">of ideas and a lot of frustration of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zhi</font>

936
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:31,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">hao as an industry do we do better but i</font>

937
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,360
think if if you're in a consulting role

938
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,920
or if you're within your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> company you</font>

939
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,690
need to help try to understand and

940
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,640
identify first what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is and</font>

941
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:40,350
that sounds so basic but a lot of

942
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,850
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been to they don't</font>

943
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:44,040
understand what it is that they're

944
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:46,350
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect or what it is that</font>

945
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,910
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to protect against they</font>

946
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:50,130
know they need of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> they know they</font>

947
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:54,299
needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that why I don't know why I just</font>

948
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:56,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I need to check the box within</font>

949
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,050
our security industry I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

950
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,670
culpable because most of the security

951
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,380
industry is driven by vendors and

952
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,910
vendors are selling solutions and do I

953
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:06,450
say it on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide or the next slide</font>

954
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:09,060
but vendors lie i used to see that all

955
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:11,640
the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a consultant and then I</font>

956
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:13,470
became<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vendor and I realized well it's</font>

957
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,450
not always the vendors are lying some of

958
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:18,299
them are conscientious and well-meaning

959
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:21,779
but they're as ignorant and uneducated

960
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:23,160
and uninformed as everybody else so they

961
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">think they're saying the right thing</font>

962
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,690
they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right thing</font>

963
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:31,050
they're using the buzzwords or to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

964
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:32,820
in 2015 terms I've got the latest logo

965
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:35,760
of the latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerability so they</font>

966
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">think they're solving the problem we</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to break down the</font>

968
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:42,000
the we need to break down what the

problems are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the simple issues that can</font>

970
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,140
be that can be digested and security is

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">not really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that complicated it means you</font>

972
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,750
have to be paranoid and you have to

973
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,520
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that things are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going bad you</font>

975
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,820
to know everything that's going on so

976
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,650
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see when something weird is</font>

happening because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the something weird</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">probably means something bad is</font>

979
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:01,530
happening and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate</font>

00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:03,330
more with in the industry within

companies we need to break down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

silos and the stove pipes we need to

00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:10,560
stop thinking well my lights green and

984
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,509
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care whatever else is going</font>

985
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,390
on no you have to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> you play a</font>

00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:17,100
role in an ecosystem and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you maybe</font>

that's mostly predicated on buying and

bias but I think that's what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1000
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:50,790
more of we need more educated consumers

1001
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:52,830
making the smart purchases in the smart

1002
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:54,779
investments and also being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

1003
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:59,340
smartly use the technologies that they

1004
00:39:54,780 --> 00:40:01,590
necessarily have to buy so again to find

1005
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:03,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem education and awareness I</font>

1006
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:05,100
think those are at the top of the list

1007
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:07,590
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

1008
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:09,810
to talk we need to educate others you

1009
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:11,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">know you guys know more than I do I know</font>

1010
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:14,160
something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

1011
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:16,680
let's keep talking that's why b-sides

1012
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,330
things are so great but we're still sort

1013
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,370
of this one little silo within a

1014
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:22,350
community you know you need to go out

1015
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:24,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">and talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IT guy you need to talk</font>

1016
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:28,110
to the DBA you need to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1017
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:29,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">business person and we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font>

1018
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:31,740
calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody that doesn't</font>

1019
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:34,700
understand it the way we do stupid or

1020
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:36,899
ignorant or uninformed and educate them

1021
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,910
because there was a time when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't</font>

1022
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:41,740
know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

1023
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:43,270
so you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's a certain</font>

1024
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,620
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ownership that we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font>

1025
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:48,280
as an industry and take responsibility

1026
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:51,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">for our role of action or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inaction and</font>

1027
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,200
why we've gotten to this place so again

1028
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:57,160
the security is a verb it's it's a

1029
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,990
lifestyle that's something we do and it

1030
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:02,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">starts with you be the change that you</font>

1031
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:05,560
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see set aside</font>

1032
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:08,740
the there's not too much arrogance or

1033
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,779
anything like that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this industry that</font>

1034
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:12,720
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be humble and we need to</font>

1035
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,610
teach we need if somebody doesn't know

1036
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,580
explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to him and explain it to them</font>

1037
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:20,410
in a way that they can understand it in

1038
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:22,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the best way to learn to communicate is</font>

1039
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:26,109
the first shut up and listen I've

1040
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:29,890
learned people talk about this this

1041
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:31,660
whole industry being a game and gaming

1042
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:34,000
is certainly a huge part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> industry</font>

1043
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:36,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">I I tend to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it more of a puzzle</font>

1044
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,810
because puzzles have solutions<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1045
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,630
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than one solution there's</font>

1046
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:43,029
not always one just one size fits all

1047
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:45,520
solution but there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually a solution</font>

1048
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:47,260
out there to whatever the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is or</font>

1049
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,690
the puzzle and the puzzle is not just

1050
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:51,190
how do we fix a problem the<font color="#E5E5E5"> puzzle i'm</font>

1051
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:54,460
talking about is how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix this</font>

1052
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:55,840
industry there's ways to do it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

saying i have ideas of what i think is

1055

what do we need to be going good

1056
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:06,360
communication building trust it's going

<font color="#E5E5E5">to take time</font>

and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth questions</font>

1059
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:17,450
comments wake up

1060
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:30,240
yes sir you're saying this securely I

1061
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:32,590
was kind of thinking of a paradigm

1062
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,419
police academy movies and you know how

1063
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:38,320
lieutenant hooks was always the

1064
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:41,140
soft-spoken person until she got really

1065
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,210
upset and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then she started to beat voice</font>

1066
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:46,210
full and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I always think that security</font>

1067
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:48,790
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> was always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tactical character I'm</font>

1068
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:52,120
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be soft-spoken and security</font>

1069
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:54,220
security and he got<font color="#E5E5E5"> I made it like to</font>

1070
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,080
present the presentation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it yeah lets</font>

1073
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,600
jobs because a lot of people don't care

1074
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:07,750
about security it's all about dollars

1075
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:09,880
all about just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know wait yeah we</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the road you know you want to avoid</font>

month right what happens though right

I've been doing over the last year year

1088

go into a customer and I make a

1091
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:49,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because I come away there a</font>

1092
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,450
little bit more secure not that they're

1093
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:54,660
secure but they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

1094
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:56,700
hacked tomorrow knock on wood none of

the companies that I worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you</font>

00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:01,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">know over the last 10 12 years have been</font>

1097
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:03,810
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> news recently now unfortunately a</font>

1098
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:05,939
lot of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> were my customers because</font>

news you know far<font color="#E5E5E5"> and away too many</font>

1101
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:13,050
companies get it get it they get

1102
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:14,520
religion because they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> breached and</font>

1103
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:18,060
then they start<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing things you know</font>

1104
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,950
then the purse strings open up so I yeah

1105
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,509
I'm fighting this feeling of what you

1106
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:24,270
know why I even bothering what's it all

1107
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:26,220
worth but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't given up yet and I</font>

1108
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:27,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we truly need to do something</font>

1109
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:29,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">different because we've been talking as</font>

1110
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,590
an industry about we need to do

1111
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:35,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">something different for 20 years and</font>

1112
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:39,119
we're still doing the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing yes sir</font>

1113
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:44,279
do you think as if USA

1114
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:47,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">see ID SS doing we all know filia that</font>

1115
00:44:44,279 --> 00:44:49,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's basic security we've seen companies</font>

1116
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:54,690
that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that b/ci assessments before</font>

1117
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:56,549
and yet they've been breached and you

1118
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:58,289
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> so are they doing enough and you</font>

1119
00:44:56,549 --> 00:44:59,960
should they be doing more and you know

1120
00:44:58,289 --> 00:45:02,930
what is the value<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how</font>

1121
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:05,030
in ASB and not something along the lines

1122
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:07,250
of having some sort of certified and

1123
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:09,710
desperate because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we all get</font>

1124
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:12,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">into where head that means a lot of</font>

1125
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:18,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">different things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

1126
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:22,279
is happening with the check so let me

1127
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:26,750
rephrase the question for the four in

1128
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:29,540
per tua tea for preservation safe you

1129
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:32,119
know is the PCI DSS really doing

1130
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:34,369
anything good is it worth it or should

1131
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:36,560
companies be doing any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things more</font>

1132
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:41,240
it should be doing more<font color="#CCCCCC"> weren't there</font>

1133
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:44,240
but so I actually do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very strong</font>

1134
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:46,399
opinion on that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the the</font>

1135
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,529

1137

00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:58,220
keeping up with the changing and

1140
00:45:54,680 --> 00:46:02,779
technology not necessarily I'd say no

1141
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:07,910
but as a foundational security framework

1142
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:10,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">its covering all the bases what is what</font>

1143
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:13,848
has been done with PCI in terms of

1144
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:16,280
enforcement is where it becomes viewed

1145
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:17,390
as a bare minimum approach in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

getting ready to write a blog and

1147
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:24,200
probably make a few enemies the the new

1151
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,450
think that's a bunch of crap because if

1152
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:33,800
you're actually doing what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pci</font>

1153
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:35,720
standard says if you're actually

1154
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,940
compliant with it that means you're

1155
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,740
looking at logs on a daily basis on

1156
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:41,900
which necessarily means while you're

1157
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:43,729
using some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of technology solution</font>

1158
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:47,780
that's automating it for you you're

1159
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:50,210
doing patch installation within<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 days</font>

1160
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:52,430
of release of the patch you've got a

1161
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:53,750
vulnerability program that's looking for

1162
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:55,669
vulnerabilities nobody does that

1163
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:57,589
everybody relies on the scanners right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1164
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:59,480
work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a scanning technology company</font>

1165
00:46:57,589 --> 00:47:00,980
where you wait for the vendor to come

1166
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,589
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the patch and that's where the</font>

1167
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:05,570
fire drill starts but you know so you're

1168
00:47:03,589 --> 00:47:07,790
the second part of your question is

1169
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:09,650
vulnerability scanning or an ASV versus

1170
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:12,650
a pen test

1171
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:16,549
I would love to about a panel discussion

1172
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:18,020
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> keynote before him and I have a</font>

1173
00:47:16,549 --> 00:47:21,559
presentation that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pen</font>

1175
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:26,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">I can fill in and give it to him later</font>

1176
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:28,700
this afternoon in this day and age of

1177
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,589
pen testing nobody ever defines what it

1178
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,720
is what is a pen test what's the purpose

1179
00:47:30,589 --> 00:47:34,578
of the pen test what a pen test

1180
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,288
typically is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety-nine percent of the</font>

1181
00:47:34,579 --> 00:47:38,390
time is it's a vulnerability assessment

1182
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:40,760
I personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe because I used to</font>

1183
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:43,490
patent I used to be the guy that SAT uh

1184
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:47,180
you know I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same problem I did</font>

1185
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:49,129
the last time years before well that

1186
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:50,808
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could mean they're not doing</font>

1187
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:52,430
their job it could also mean you as a

1188
00:47:50,809 --> 00:47:54,049
pen tester aren't doing your job either

1189
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:55,910
because you're not educating and

1190
00:47:54,049 --> 00:47:59,059
providing the justification for making

1191
00:47:55,910 --> 00:48:01,788
the change but in today's age a pen test

1192
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:05,059
should really be not vulnerability based

1193
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:06,559
at all because take<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI is an example</font>

1194
00:48:05,059 --> 00:48:08,240
you've secured your network you've

1195
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,250
secured your systems you have patch

1196
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,259
management in place if you have

1197
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:14,150
vulnerability management in place you're

1198
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:16,460
doing an annual risk assessment you're

1199
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:18,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">scanning at least quarterly and they're</font>

1200
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:20,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying you get a clean result at least</font>

1201
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,859
quarterly which necessarily means you're

1202
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,839
scanning more often than that you're

1203
00:48:21,859 --> 00:48:27,078
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> an annual pen test you're doing</font>

1204
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:29,839
all these things where was I going with

1205
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:32,119
that like bling my head and so you get

1206
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:33,890
to the pen test the pen test shouldn't

1207
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:35,240
be finding a default password that

1208
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:36,200
should have been picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up already it</font>

1209
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,029
shouldn't be finding a Miss

1210
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,828
configuration that's have been picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

1211
00:48:38,029 --> 00:48:41,059
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> it shouldn't be finding the</font>

1212
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:42,859
missing patch that should have been

1213
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:45,020
picked up<font color="#CCCCCC"> already what a pen test is</font>

1214
00:48:42,859 --> 00:48:47,930
always supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been is you've</font>

1215
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:50,538
put the secure things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in place and then</font>

1216
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:52,368
the pen test is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is used to find out what</font>

1217
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:54,140
you're missing order to connect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dots</font>

1218
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:56,089
on things that are necessarily out there

1219
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,069
so essentially a pen test should be

1220
00:48:56,089 --> 00:48:59,960
threat based it should be emulating what

1221
00:48:58,069 --> 00:49:02,240
the bad guy is trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to break</font>

1222
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:04,430
into your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and can you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> detect</font>

1223
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,020
them and can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> catch them so it should</font>

1224
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:07,910
all be about the threat it shouldn't be

1225
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:09,230
vulnerability based at all if you're

1226
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:11,058
writing if you're a pen tester and

1227
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:13,099
you're writing report and your result is

1228
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:15,140
you're missing a patch I'm saying that's

1229
00:49:13,099 --> 00:49:17,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bad pen test your results should be</font>

1230
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:19,308
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a broken process that's</font>

1231
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:21,020
allowed a system to be out<font color="#CCCCCC"> here without</font>

1232
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:21,610
this patch being installed that's been

1233
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:24,800
out for

1234
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:26,360
750 days or whatever it is and what's

1235
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,670
wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your process for the last</font>

1236
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:31,280
three years that didn't detect that this

1237
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:34,790
patch was missing what is also

1238
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:38,300
fundamental<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem ok questions there's</font>

1239
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:40,550
a fundamental problem really<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you</font>

1240
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:43,070
know a client going out hired directly

00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:45,830
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentester when the client controls</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> losses engaged yep because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the pen</font>

1243
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:56,029
test should really show real business

1244
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:57,919
risk yes and if the client says you can

1245
00:49:56,030 --> 00:50:03,740
only look at this one aspect when you

1246
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:05,960
can't go further well and I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

1247
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:07,640
tested in a long time but as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a qsa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

1248
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,980
to review<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of pen test reports I</font>

1249
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:11,750
used to get into arguments with my own

1250
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:13,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">companies pen testers because one of</font>

1251
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:16,010
their favorite findings was and was a

1252
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:18,200
critical finding was they found an ftp

1253
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:19,850
server I'm like what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you exploit it</font>

1254
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,450
well no I just found it it was the

1255
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:26,390
nessus result and like okay I know that

1256
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:28,549
ftp is an open protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that</font>

1257
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:31,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's historically problems with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FTP</font>

1258
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:34,070
servers I used to exploit them but did

1259
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have you know they've kind of come a</font>

1260
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:41,560
long way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact in the early days</font>

1261
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:44,870
you know the ftp was a good target as a

1262
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:47,630
server because it contained all the

1263
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:49,460
users and passwords user IDs and

1264
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:51,260
passwords for the domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

1265
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:52,790
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could knock over the ftp</font>

1266
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:55,190
server which had lots of vulnerabilities

1267
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:58,490
and or if you could scan or sniff the

1268
00:50:55,190 --> 00:51:00,740
traffic the logins you were getting the

1269
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:01,939
credentials to get into the domain most

1270
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:05,180
companies don't run them like that

1271
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:08,240
anymore most<font color="#CCCCCC"> FTP servers are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sandbox you</font>

1272
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:10,879

1273
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,979
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you should know not to use</font>

1274
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,800
your same password on an ftp server as

1275
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:17,360
your domain password does doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

1276
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:20,000
people don't do it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> if that's a</font>

1277
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:21,320
finding if you've exploited that that's

1278
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,630
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and say</font>

00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:26,600
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a broken process because</font>

1280
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:28,040
you're not educating your users to keep

1281
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:32,299
them separate

1282
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:33,950
time's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let me move on are there</font>

1283
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:37,310
any other questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can take this up</font>

1284
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:41,089
at the later on yes sir so you had a

1285
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:43,070
slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you showed in 98 yes so with</font>

1286
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:44,930
that being said we're almost 20 years

1287
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:46,640
whatever the<font color="#E5E5E5"> events have you seen in 20</font>

1288
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:50,299
years like is the b-sides community and

1289
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:55,250
the community coming together is there

1290
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:58,220
more dialogue I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1291
00:51:55,250 --> 00:52:00,770
potentially good thing and the fact that

1292
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:03,319
a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of people that don't</font>

1293
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:05,660
usually have a voice or getting together

1294
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:10,370
and talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> things I think is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1295
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:12,259
good thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we need to learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

1296
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:14,509
about what the different is because all

1297
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:16,490
I keep hearing from the keynotes is the

1298
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:18,230
same old you know we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing things</font>

1299
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:19,729
poorly we need to do things differently

1300
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:22,940
but it's always from this sort of

1301
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:27,470
perspective that the be all end all is

1302
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:29,810
the pen test it's the hack and truly I

1303
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:32,240
mean if you've ever felt it the

1304
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:33,680
commercial<font color="#CCCCCC"> world the business world they</font>

1305
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,899
don't care what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're saying because</font>

1306
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,450
they're they're making money<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand over</font>

1307
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:40,940
fist and they're willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pay the</font>

1308
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:44,359
price<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the occasional pop here and</font>

1309
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:47,330
there I was at I was at a risk seminar

1310
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:49,550
last year where somebody from visa stood

1311
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:53,950
up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of his presentation was he</font>

1312
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:57,410
said it costs visa four and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half cents</font>

1313
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:59,419
in terms of fraud loss for every one

1314
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:00,890
hundred dollars that's transacted on a

1315
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:03,410
Visa card and I'm sitting there<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

1316
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:05,240
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay a nickel for every hundred</font>

1317
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:08,690
dollars i spent to not have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do all</font>

1318
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:10,459
this who wouldn't it's like why are we

1319
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:12,140
why are we even bothering of course you

1320
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:14,600
know visa spends gazillions of dollars

1321
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:17,450
on fraud prevention to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that number</font>

1322
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:19,790
down but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they've gotten it</font>

1323
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:21,710
down to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs them a nickel for every</font>

1324
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:24,320
hundred dollars that's transacted on a

1325
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:26,570
Visa card so there's a quick plug and

1326
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:28,910
we'll wrap it up my next talk that I'm

1327
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:31,220
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the evolution of my thoughts</font>

1328
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:34,879
and I hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it a couple b-sides</font>

1329
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:35,859
next year is an attempt to teach us this

1330
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,150
community

1331
00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:39,038
communicate and get our point across

1332
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:42,099
better because we're great at talking

1333
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:44,619
amongst ourselves but we don't typically

1334
00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:47,019
do too well talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what I've heard</font>

1335
00:53:44,619 --> 00:53:49,319
somebody refer to as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mughals which</font>

1336
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:51,549
again is something we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to stop doing</font>

1337
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:52,869
we need to learn how to speak the

1338
00:53:51,549 --> 00:53:55,119
language of business you've heard that

1339
00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:57,640
up front but I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the talk</font>

1340
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,230
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just based on my 20 years of going</font>

1341
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">into companies and having to talk to all</font>

1342
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:02,440
sorts of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of people and</font>

1343
00:54:00,789 --> 00:54:04,989
then ultimately I'm trying to put

1344
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:07,839
together a training course and you know

1345
00:54:04,989 --> 00:54:09,339
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> first experience at NSA that thing</font>

1346
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:12,519
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> building a</font>

1347
00:54:09,339 --> 00:54:14,470
computer based encryption system NSA had

1348
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:17,109
never done that before so I'm 25 years

1349
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:20,788
old having to pitch it to us essentially

1350
00:54:17,109 --> 00:54:22,839
the the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> of directors of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the of NSA</font>

1351
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:24,819
explain to them why it was a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

1352
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:26,589
to do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wow we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could do it securely</font>

1353
00:54:24,819 --> 00:54:29,529
and that was okay for us to proceed with

1354
00:54:26,589 --> 00:54:32,200
that I've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked back from that I</font>

1355
00:54:29,529 --> 00:54:35,079
can talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody any group because as</font>

1356
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:37,450
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 25-year old I was pissing my pants up</font>

1357
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:39,489
there in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all these suits gray</font>

1358
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:41,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">here you know much older of course</font>

1359
00:54:39,489 --> 00:54:43,660
they're my age now I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> the age of them</font>

1360
00:54:41,739 --> 00:54:47,799
at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point but you know that was</font>

1361
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:49,899
scary for a 25 year old to do how many

1362
00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:51,819
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the opportunity to get up and</font>

1363
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,380
speak in front of a group this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1364
00:54:51,819 --> 00:54:55,359
great place to start that's one of the

1365
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:57,039
reasons why b-sides exists is to give

1366
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:59,859
everybody an opportunity to just stand

1367
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:03,220
up and speak learn how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to a</font>

1368
00:54:59,859 --> 00:55:05,140
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> to individuals there's a lot of</font>

1369
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:07,988
really smart people around here with a

1370
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:11,618
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of great ideas that we and as a</font>

1371
00:55:07,989 --> 00:55:13,779
group<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't often get heard by others</font>

1372
00:55:11,619 --> 00:55:16,509
and there's reasons why that is that I

1373
00:55:13,779 --> 00:55:18,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we can get get beyond and again</font>

1374
00:55:16,509 --> 00:55:22,029
it's education that's awareness and it's

1375
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:24,160
training<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's opportunity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think</font>

1376
00:55:22,029 --> 00:55:27,239
I'm probably blown past the time so

1377
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,239
thank you guys and

1378
00:55:27,769 --> 00:55:33,140
hopefully we'll hang<font color="#E5E5E5"> out at dinner</font>

1379
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:33,140
tonight<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk more</font>
