1
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:21,850
the title of this presentation if you

2
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,710
read it probably little confused or

3
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">curious what it means hopefully I'll</font>

4
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,860
explain it here but just I want to

5
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:28,840
everyone to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get from this is this is not</font>

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna be a highly technical it's going</font>

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,320
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be something where it's just a</font>

8
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,900
situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think a lot of us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,900
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> placed in and sometimes creativity</font>

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,180
can be one of those things a backfire

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,860
let's start so one of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite quotes</font>

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,019
is absence of evidence is not evidence

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,090
of absence and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of you that</font>

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,430
work in security will kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

15
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,720
me the principle that you know just

16
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you don't see an entry door you</font>

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,269
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a flaw on the way you've</font>

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,379
configured your network or you don't see

19
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,780
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean that something like that</font>

20
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't exist if it didn't none of us</font>

21
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,050
would have jobs in here so it's one of

22
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,910
those things that I'd love so we try to

23
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,940
try to reiterate that with a lot of our

24
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:05,500
clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming through so Who am I my</font>

25
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,330
name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christopher i'm the founder and</font>

26
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">CEO of a local security company here in</font>

27
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,509
Charleston Phelps interior we've also

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,360
got offices in San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Francisco and</font>

29
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:16,450
Washington DC we handle Incident

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,400
Response security consulting pretty much

31
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,980
every gamut but our big<font color="#CCCCCC"> Forte's and kind</font>

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">of hunt team operations or tracking down</font>

33
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:26,080
nation-state threat actors we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't use</font>

34
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,640
the buzzwords like apt and cyber because

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,920
I may think everyone in here hates those

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,450
words but our forte is is simply

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,280
tracking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that down and there's a reason</font>

38
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">why I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe we're better than everyone</font>

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,380
else<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that and I'll explain that</font>

40
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,790
here little bit my background so

41
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,800
wherever I worked what have I done

42
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:44,020
apologize it looks like the texts in

43
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,479
black here so I was in the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font>

44
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,220
Army where I was the 35 year which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

45
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,720
signal collectors intelligence analyst

46
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,548
my job was to break microwave

47
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,220
frequencies break satellite

48
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:55,900
communications basically exploit

49
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,310
anything that could send a signal I

50
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,650
spent a little time there did field

51
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,960
operations all over northern Africa your

52
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,940
traditional fun places that we've been

53
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the past few years as well as Eastern</font>

54
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,049
Europe and in some Asian countries

55
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,220
through that I was attached<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

56
00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:11,709
University nine states army intelligence

57
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,150
security command which is basically the

58
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:14,050
intelligence component of the army I

59
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,760
know that's

60
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,560
US Army Intelligence or military

61
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,929
intelligence but believe it or not there

62
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,460
is some smart work that goes on there i

63
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,470
would say probably ten percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

64
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,330
work we did was smart but we do get a

65
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,770
chance to do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun things but</font>

66
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,900
through that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually got augmented</font>

67
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,890
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> National Security Agency that's</font>

68
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,960
the one that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you probably hate</font>

69
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,970
or you have your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinions on</font>

70
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,880
clothing by the National<font color="#CCCCCC"> Security Agency</font>

71
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,109
though is as an army component member of

72
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,000
the National<font color="#CCCCCC"> Security Agency I'm</font>

73
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,030
afforded the rights to do things like

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,400
computer network exploitation an attack

75
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,560
so essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get to be a hacker so</font>

76
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,300
as a company we use the slogan former

77
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,680
hackers fighting hackers we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

78
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,510
this in a hacker since that we've kind

79
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">of tweaked and tooled but we literally</font>

80
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,690
mean it that the vast majority of our

81
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">employees have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Awards sitting on their</font>

82
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,380
desk from any president two prime

83
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,940
ministers from foreign country saying

84
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,230
hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks for doing computer network</font>

85
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,960
attacked and exploitation on our behalf

86
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,010
so in the tourists have sense there's

87
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,160
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who legally say</font>

88
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,299
they're hackers and that's what we work

89
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,040
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to spend time with the Central</font>

90
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,840
Intelligence Agency that's the one I

91
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,880
probably will talk to least about skip

92
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,160
that I've also got a lot of word with

93
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">the FBI</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on tracking down internal and</font>

94
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,820
external threats I won't mention any

95
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:26,829
major projects but we did deal with kind

96
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,660
of homegrown cyber threats and

97
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:31,470
particularly criminal groups that were

98
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:34,030
using us resources to steal<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

99
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,770
another fun place I worked out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with GCHQ</font>

100
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,870
which is essentially the NSA equivalent

101
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:41,100
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UK</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spent a lot of time over in</font>

102
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:43,330
England working on some fun projects and

103
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,280
definitely would like to go back it's a

104
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,930
fun place to live while<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was working on</font>

105
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">the agency though I was getting the</font>

106
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,780
opportunity about a big retire and with

107
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,100
some friends we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are working on some</font>

108
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,260
software and then typical government

109
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,579
fashion was uh you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a lot of just</font>

110
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,829
build software you gotta let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me conveyed</font>

111
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,750
on it so our solution was to go back and

112
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">start a company so bunch of us got</font>

113
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,860
together and started a company called

114
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:05,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">426 building large-scale data analytics</font>

115
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,330
platforms so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hadoop based</font>

116
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,490
platform that was taking computer

117
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,290
network operations data so<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

118
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:13,390
attack traffic network exploitation

119
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,700
traffic and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> network defense stuff</font>

120
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:18,010
so taking in threat feeds vulnerability

121
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,779
scans and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of logs from different</font>

122
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,849
resources and looking for we're

123
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:23,619
relationships where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really made a</font>

124
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,240
breakthrough and that is the biggest

125
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,400
piece of security that's often

126
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,590
overlooked in the IT world<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

127
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,510
particular is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the human component from</font>

128
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,520
HR perspective the behavioral patterns

129
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,680
of the you as a user so one of the

130
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,390
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we looked at was let's not</font>

131
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,100
focus just on finding a specific

132
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,510
signature let's look for patterns of

133
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,640
behavior you know certain users<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

134
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,690
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> techniques and procedures so we</font>

135
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,890
spent time going through and

136
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,140
understanding that and trying to

137
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,820
correlate those patterns very

138
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,770
rudimentary at the time the works there

139
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:54,099
fortunately we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were required</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by CFC</font>

140
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,870
fairly fast didn't stay there that long

141
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,610
because I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big fan of big scale</font>

142
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,800
defense contractors I feel they kind of

143
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,500
skinny a little bit of research and I

144
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,640
decided it was time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move out so when</font>

145
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,919
I left<font color="#CCCCCC"> there actually went to work for</font>

146
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,510
another company called alienvault

147
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,640
alienvault makes awesome which is a free

148
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,010
platform available for system incident

149
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,719
event management<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much like four to</font>

150
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,849
six where I worked at a company we built

151
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,930
the products where we gathered gain and

152
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,570
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of correlated it and produce</font>

153
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,340
security threats alienvault was doing

154
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,380
the same thing essentially it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

155
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,719
network operations center or security

156
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,729
operations center in a box the premise

157
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,979
being that most firms whether you could

158
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:32,110
afford it<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not have a need for network</font>

159
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:33,219
operations and security operations but

160
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,370
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> simply can't afford to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put the</font>

161
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:38,110
staff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were necessary so it's a very</font>

162
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> background so it's giving me</font>

163
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,000
the experience of both working

164
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,240
operationally tactically offensively and

165
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,099
defensively

166
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,759
and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's helped out quite a</font>

167
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:50,900
bit with where we're at so<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font>

168
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,449
places that I've worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at and doing</font>

169
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,508
consulting and time I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done some</font>

170
00:05:53,449 --> 00:06:00,289
pretty big deals with linkedin google

171
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:02,120
facebook apple yahoo 18t<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft and</font>

172
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:03,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sony I think these are companies that</font>

173
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,669
everybody here knows and these are

174
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,659
companies that I can I can acknowledge

175
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:09,919
working on things I've done a lot of

176
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,090
random things for these different

177
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,219
companies everything from general

178
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,520
security consulting and kind of going

179
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,479
through situation room type planning of

180
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,310
hypothetically what could happen here or

181
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:21,258
what could<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen there all the way down</font>

182
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,270
to in the case of the lower right to

183
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:25,610
Microsoft and Sony working on how can i

184
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,049
exploit you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> platforms they were</font>

185
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,150
building at a time so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> prior to</font>

186
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,740
the Xbox coming out in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PlayStation</font>

187
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,169
coming out there's some very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

188
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,460
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I got to work on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that plus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

189
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:35,780
got some free hardware I'm at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

190
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,000
the day who doesn't like free games and

191
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,469
consoles so it's been a very very

192
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting exposure to the big</font>

193
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,960
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one thing that's been</font>

194
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,940
really cool to about working with

195
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,130
companies that this scale is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

196
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,449
everyone here will agree the government

197
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,070
you know you can have access to some

198
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:51,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty cool big large data sets but</font>

199
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:53,150
everything is trumped by the commercial

200
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:56,419
providers the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data that Yahoo</font>

201
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:58,340
Google Facebook Apple linkedin AT&T are

202
00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:01,609
capturing about every one of you right

203
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,349
now is insane so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whereas if I</font>

204
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,639
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create threat rules and</font>

205
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:06,530
correlation you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font>

206
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,360
generate on a good day a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple hundred</font>

207
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,469
gigabytes of data you go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

208
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,849
environments and you literally have

209
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:12,889
access to petabytes of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

210
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:15,169
spanning a globe which is which is

211
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:16,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">insane so it was part of the other</font>

212
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:18,539
reason why I was very happy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

213
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,250
work with these different teams

214
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:22,840
so the title of time you spent twenty

215
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,550
thousand dollars so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> my throwaway</font>

216
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,830
email account can have full recon on

217
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,389
your internal network<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-winded i know</font>

218
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:33,340
but i think the twenty-thousand-dollar

219
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:34,750
point is an interesting one so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

220
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:39,090
this talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this talk is</font>

221
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:42,250
essentially a real life example of a

222
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:44,979
creative deployment from one of our

223
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:47,190
clients that was kind of forced out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

224
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:49,330
necessity but it was also forced out of

225
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,310
misrepresentation by a sales sales

226
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,020
representative I mean someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

227
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">security selling security misrepresented</font>

228
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,599
their product<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> told her to do</font>

229
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,508
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong I mean who figured that</font>

230
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,009
would ever happen right so a culmination

231
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:03,159
of the two created a very unique

232
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:04,300
situation for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us that we were not even</font>

233
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:06,310
looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just happened to come</font>

234
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,560
across<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a normal</font>

235
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,819
investigation the big thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

236
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,560
everyone to remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that whenever</font>

237
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:13,449
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a decision for security or</font>

238
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,610
concerns there's always a secondary risk

239
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:17,349
right the evidence of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the absence of</font>

240
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,840
what you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the risk doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

241
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:21,520
that there isn't a risk you know so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

242
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">always good to have second eyes or kind</font>

243
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">of an outside perspective on a lot of</font>

244
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the big things</font>

245
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we face as as security</font>

246
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,699
professionals is a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times we have</font>

247
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,169
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about security not only from</font>

248
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:33,729
what we want to do but we got to think

249
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">of things like a budgetary constraints</font>

250
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,839
maybe we have technology deployment

251
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:40,570
constraints and and sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're just</font>

252
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,599
told look make it do something and think

253
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,980
outside of the box so I don't fault this

254
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,950
particular individual for how this this

255
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,959
kind of issue came up but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think as a</font>

256
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,610
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of systemic across our</font>

257
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:53,500
enterprise simply because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do have to</font>

258
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:56,840
patch things we do have to kind of make

259
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:59,850
things work as we go through

260
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,050
so a lot of time just sitting in the

261
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,730
boardroom or you're sitting in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

262
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,770
meetings and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first thing you hear is</font>

263
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,450
a hey guy you know IT guy we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

264
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,730
something because we've got some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

265
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:11,010
security audit coming up you know we got

266
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">some PCI audit or some HIPAA compliant</font>

267
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">something-something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business-wise is</font>

268
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,950
driving the need for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security to</font>

269
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:20,339
start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at things and deploying</font>

270
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:21,690
solutions within the enterprise one of

271
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things maybe security posturing you</font>

272
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,920
know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clients have been very</font>

273
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,170
reactive to some of the recent breaches

274
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,790
I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone here is heard</font>

275
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,279
you know everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> from Sonia to anthem</font>

276
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,300
to OPM and everything clients are

277
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,610
getting smarter and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> starting to</font>

278
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,170
ask questions so when the c-suite that

279
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,000
knows nothing about technology start and

280
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,560
ask you about security all of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden</font>

281
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,750
you have it I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start implementing</font>

282
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,520
it another one that we've actually seen

283
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,600
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been pretty consistent is people</font>

284
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,699
are starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to underwrite insurance</font>

285
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,040
policies they need as an IT firm they

286
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,270
need to have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of cybersecurity</font>

287
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">liability insurance and so part of that</font>

288
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,680
is is you have to come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say hey we</font>

289
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,689
meet the criteria of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a B and C to get</font>

290
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,040
the policy so that is underwritten and

291
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:03,240

00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,180

assessment what is the time in motion I

310
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,969
mean it takes time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rack equipment</font>

deploy it fix permissions and firewalls

312
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,480
picked fixed routing so that you prat

313
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,310
you know have<font color="#CCCCCC"> X access to what you need</font>

314
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,540
to maybe out of spans and caps off the

315
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,949
network ports and you gotta you know

316
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,110
route things for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I mean it takes</font>

317
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,760
time I think all of us agree that

318
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,529
nothing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug-and-play despite what</font>

they say in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box you know we're</font>

320
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:57,120
always having a tinker and tweak with it

321
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,140
a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is reporting you know what is</font>

the end result who are the stakeholders

323
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,339
that have some buy-in is the c-suite

324
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,230
need a special type of report does the

325
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:05,930
IT security staff need a special type of

assessments on existing servers needless

336
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,330
to say the point I'm trying to make is

337
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,920
that there's millions of questions you

338
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">can ask and every time you answer one</font>

339
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,529
there's going to be 10 more subsequent

340
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,439
questions that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come up from</font>

341
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:35,990
it so as a security analyst or security

342
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,660
auditor or as a secure employment ation

343
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,290
specialist<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever your title maybe</font>

344
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,819
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things you have to</font>

345
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,439
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> many times they overlooked</font>

346
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,180
or you try to find solutions that are

347
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,700
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix those or make them a little</font>

348
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:49,939
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> faster for us and that's where we're</font>

349
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,380
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> so all things considered firms tend</font>

350
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,870
to purchase ready-made solution so

351
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,430
that's where every<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of us can write</font>

352
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,540
you know python scripts we can come up

353
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">the creative way of doing something</font>

354
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">better but just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like the old adage of</font>

355
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,839
everybody can always develop software

356
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,339
better until you do it it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

357
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:07,070
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and given the time constraints</font>

358
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:08,779
most of us are facing working 60 80 120

359
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,010
hours a week it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like that we're</font>

360
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:12,620
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to build our own solutions</font>

361
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,150
to solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> this so what we do is we go out</font>

362
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,650
and we say I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy this magic</font>

363
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,120
box I'm going to buy this you know this

364
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,430
network appliance that does everything

365
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">or I'm going to buy this deployment</font>

366
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,969
endpoint monitor that's going to solve

367
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,979
this problem so so we look for buying

368
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,900
solutions and<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course sales loves it</font>

369
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,870
because you know you're selling stuff

370
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,800
and people r going to buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a lot of</font>

371
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,420
times these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are things that you start</font>

372
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,770
adding you know the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that we've</font>

373
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,779
seen it's been pretty consistent to is

374
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,339
there's now line items for security on

375
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:39,620
the budgets of a lot of firms and I

376
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,570
don't just mean in you know 10 million

377
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,580
hundred million you know 200 billion

378
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,170
dollar<font color="#E5E5E5"> firms I'm talking companies that</font>

379
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,190
are worth half a million dollars or a

380
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,360
quarter million dollars are thinking

381
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,310
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right well what kind of</font>

382
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,110
security appliance can we buy for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

383
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,880
grand<font color="#E5E5E5"> or five grand to secure us because</font>

384
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,900
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think at the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day consumers</font>

385
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,880
are smarter now and realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

386
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,260
everybody is a threat a good example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

387
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,850
that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be you know target getting</font>

388
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,200
breached not through target about

389
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">through a third party provider I</font>

390
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,510
guarantee<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heating air conditioning</font>

391
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:07,490
specialist company had no clue about

392
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,680
security and had no thought to buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

393
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,000
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> now companies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like that that</font>

394
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,510
generally don't have that exposure are

395
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,550
having to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about these questions</font>

396
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,990
so automated vulnerability scans is

397
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,449
where we're at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things</font>

398
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people love because I mean</font>

399
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,290
who doesn't love automation if I can

400
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,110
throw in a couple IPS or I can click a

401
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,550
button in a GUI that says hey scan it

402
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,800
all up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me it saves me time I don't</font>

403
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to write Python scripts there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

404
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways these technologies</font>

405

406
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:38,569
hosted deployed internally so you can

407
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,489
have a hardware appliance you buy that

408
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,570
that automates scans and and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

409
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,210
assessments inside of your network

410
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,790
you've got virtualization solutions so

411
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:48,380
if you deployed VMware vSphere or any

412
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,209
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the open source variants of that</font>

413
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,350
you can deploy it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

414
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,670
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have got some custom docker</font>

415
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,650
containers that you can throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> out some</font>

416
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:58,310
of these assessment tools that are out

417
00:13:54,650 --> 00:14:00,380
there you kind of have to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to families</font>

418
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,000
though of products<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> available it</font>

419
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,340
kind of the free side and then you've

420
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">got the paid to play so the benefit of</font>

421
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">the free side is obviously at is free</font>

422
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,270
the cost there is your time in motion

423
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:13,490
and experience so once again one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

424
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">problems trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solve is improving</font>

425
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,760
security with the least amount of time

426
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,080
and effort put into it so while open

427
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,670
source is great and most of us are

428
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,190
champions of it in smaller networks it's

429
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:23,599
just not feasible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> big deployments so</font>

430
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,850
that's where the paid kind of vendors

431
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,530
come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on the page side you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

432
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,360
some pretty cool products in the case of

433
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,670
automated assessments and vulnerability

434
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,140
scanning and I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of you will</font>

435
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,360
have tons of products<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you've used</font>

436
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,800
and prefer but some of the big tier

437
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,100
people that are out there providing

438
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,770
stuff are tenable provide solutions

439
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,360
obviously for the nessus line I've got

440
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything from cloud hosted internal</font>

441
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,960
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> qualis who's an event sponsor</font>

442
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,290
here provide solutions you know

443
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,790
web-hosted and also internal solutions

444
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,439
then you've got you know you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

445
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,360
custom third-party<font color="#CCCCCC"> roll-your-own</font>

446
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,430
distributions that people have written<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

447
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,260
mean there's a bunch of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are</font>

448
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:03,109
selling essentially Kali scripts and

449
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:04,970
ability sends you an ISO image of Kali

450
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,810
that customized with vulnerability scans

451
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:10,430
that run on run on a boot is that really

452
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,900
a paid solution I don't know you know

453
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of support and but</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">people are paying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for those things some</font>

456
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,250

459
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,340
the benefit of some of these things

460
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,510
though like GFI and retinas they

461
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,550
actually kind of cross over into other

462
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,960
needs so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only do we find</font>

463
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,520
vulnerabilities and do these assessments

464
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,050
and see if we're compliant you know

465
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,040
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure the systems are hardened but</font>

466
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,839
some of these actually at ability to go

467
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,640
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and force updates and deployments</font>

468
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,560
because once<font color="#E5E5E5"> again one thing that's not</font>

469
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,780
consistent across the board and most

470
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,130
networks is is the fact that while we

00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:50,950
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the growing use of Apple laptops</font>

and Linux based distributions in the

there's free tools or even paid tools

480
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,770
that can help an IT admin that doesn't

00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,470
these are great solutions each of the

00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:21,880
actually suffering from a breach doing

489
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,530
some open source threat intelligence we

490
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,450
had tracked down particular evidence

491
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,459
that a nation-state threat actor had had

492
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,140
breached can compromise the network and

493
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,430
over time we eventually built up enough

494
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,069
evidence to find out the origination

495

point including<font color="#E5E5E5"> administrator passwords</font>

and things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been leaked out to</font>

immediately start changing

<font color="#CCCCCC">low-tech</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and how they pop and networks</font>

522
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,740
to start with they tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look for</font>

523
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:28,990
vulnerabilities and PHP web

524
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,090
vulnerabilities and things like that to

525
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,230
pop and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they once they've got their</font>

526
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,820
stage one implant and they start

527
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,200
spreading the network and of course as

528
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone to hear that does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pentesting</font>

529
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,380
knows the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would target is</font>

530
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:40,120
if I can find a domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> controller I'm</font>

531
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,140
going to whack that because the domain

532
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,330
controllers gonna be key to the castle

533
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,529
so they've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty consistent tools</font>

534
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,620
technique and procedure that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow</font>

535
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:49,570
it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to read so we're very</font>

536
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:52,029
fortunate now we knew how they were kind

537
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,500
of propagating inside of the network the

538
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,880
one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do run into is many</font>

539
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,409
times once they get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that kind of</font>

540
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,789
stage 2 or stage 3 they start leveraging

541
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,529
existing credentials and it makes a

542
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:01,570
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit tougher but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing some of</font>

543
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:02,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">the patterns behaviors of the users and</font>

544
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,178
then combining<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with patterns behave</font>

545
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:07,630
as a threat actor makes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:10,390
easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of decipher so here we</font>

very valuable because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can save us</font>

575
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,168
time on kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our investigation so one</font>

576
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,630
thing I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> love to look at</font>

577
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:06,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">qualis free scans amongst a bunch of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">other ones in this particular instance</font>

579
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,149
we had asked the client for a bunch of

580
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:12,989
their internal kind of vulnerability

581
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:15,510
scans they had previous pin tests and

582
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,580
let me behold they didn't have them you

583
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,110
know at this day and age<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font>

584
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">people would have them but they don't so</font>

585
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have any documentation the ABS kind</font>

586
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,179
of some summary reports that they had

587
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,679
run from a previous scan and they

588
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,490
briefly mentioned that they'd use<font color="#E5E5E5"> koalas</font>

589
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,140
but they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have the</font>

590
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,540
credentials for it somebody wasn't in

591
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,429
the office and needless<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say there</font>

592
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,870
wasn't a whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of intelligence so as</font>

593
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:35,370
we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the internal network we</font>

594
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,389
were curious<font color="#E5E5E5"> as have potentially if</font>

595
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,830
there were any vulnerabilities or

596
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:40,320
breaches on the outside network so

597
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,490
working smarter not harder I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

598
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,530
why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just go ahead and leverage</font>

599
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:47,309
one of these free scanning utilities on

600
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:48,600
the outside so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

601
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:49,920
did if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually registered an</font>

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,230
account<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just a throwaway account</font>

603
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,570
with call us you can't use Google you

604
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:56,130
can't use yahoo but I mean a domain you

605
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get for two bucks sometimes on sale</font>

606
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,550
so if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,570

608
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,700

<font color="#CCCCCC">one-time uses and projects that you need</font>

610
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,179
so I went ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> used a an email</font>

611
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,860
address that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had set up for this</font>

612
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:10,320
engagement and created a<font color="#CCCCCC"> qualis free</font>

613
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,209

614
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,428
scan to throw in an IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're good</font>

615
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,230
to go so when we popped in<font color="#CCCCCC"> qualis</font>

616
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:18,240
offered us a free free opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,940
the vulnerability scan the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OWASP</font>

00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,000
obviously and scat compliance part of

620
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,220
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nist kind of framework of</font>

621
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,840
instruction when we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at it you</font>

622
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,429
know for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us really all we were concerned</font>

623
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,990
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately was the vulnerabilities</font>

624
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:32,700
to see if there are any gaping gaping

625
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,070
holes that we should look at first and

626
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,110
foremost because time is of the essence

627
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:38,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we gathered the information for the</font>

628
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,500
client we got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> front-facing IP of</font>

629
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">their router from from their provider it</font>

630
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:47,340
was a static IP it was great hadn't

631
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:49,050
changed so there we go so one of things

632
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,449
if it is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> drop their IP in and</font>

633
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:53,399
immediately got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a response right yay no</font>

634
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,730
high risks but all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a sudden there's</font>

635
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,140
24 vulnerabilities that's not too

636
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,490
uncommon I think most people here know a

637
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,620
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times the low</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> risk and even the</font>

638
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:03,420
medium risk of vulnerabilities they

639
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,678
could be very hypothetical only don't

640
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,110
necessarily mean they're actionable

641
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,309
there's no way to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero really at</font>

642
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,540
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the day and have a truly</font>

644
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:14,309
to be concerns but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of a</font>

645
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,420
red flag for us because the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

646
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:18,059
explained<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> existing</font>

647

SAT between everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the</font>

00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">Gateway and the end users and in that</font>

650
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,290
firewall there is only open act

651
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:29,710
s for<font color="#E5E5E5"> two to open VPN servers and to</font>

652
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:31,659
proxy servers so curiosity would say if

653
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:34,480
you've got open VPN<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers and proxy</font>

654
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,350
servers maybe one of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pop so</font>

655
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,150
let's see if there's a vulnerability

656
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:42,310
that we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> find on there nope it</font>

657
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:44,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't anything to do with openvpn or</font>

658
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:46,379
the proxy service what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found as you</font>

659
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,340
can see here is we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress</font>

660
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,410
vulnerabilities we found PHP

661
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,110
configuration vulnerabilities we had

662
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:56,530
some serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL issues internally as</font>

663
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:58,270
well and so the concern started kind of

664
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:59,560
shifting my perspective of hey wait a

665
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,730
second you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you guys told me you</font>

666
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have any of this equipment in here</font>

667
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,690
you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> running on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Gateway</font>

668
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,580
can you double check and make sure

669
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuffs not here meanwhile I'm going to</font>

670
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,330
run another scan just in case you know

671
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:12,580
heaven forbid somebody gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> me the wrong</font>

672
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:15,550
report and in the platform so we started

673
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,590
talking to the administrators and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

674
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:19,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of got a sense that even though</font>

675
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,040
their administrators running a

676
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:23,350
virtualized environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> affinity we've</font>

677
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,659
worked it with esxi or vSphere any of

678
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:29,709
those tools there was a large number of

679
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:31,270
systems that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were unaccounted for so the</font>

680
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,830
fact that we brought up that we found

681
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:35,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">WordPress and all these documents was</font>

682
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,060
immediately discredited so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ran the</font>

683
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,550
scan again and got the same results and

684
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,620
so in pushing back we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually found out</font>

685
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:43,180
that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was existing development</font>

686
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,159
machines so some of the developers had

687
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:47,140
just spun up their own instances so

688
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,030
where they gave rights to every user in

689
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,440
here as a user essentially could spin up

690
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,690
their own machines in the network they

691
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,460
can do whatever they want it that's the

692
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:56,020
security concern obviously if you're if

693
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,940
you know if you're a 200 million dollar

694
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,260
company or larger and you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

695
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,740
user can pretty much build whatever they

696
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,820
want on the network that's concerning in

697
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,740
the investigation we found some really

698
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,760
cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> things like reverse proxies where</font>

699
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,620
people were calling back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own</font>

700
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,480
homes because they wanted to bypass

701
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,919
security controls so who care did they

702
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,150
have their own proxies like I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

703
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,790
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> door myself that's how I</font>

704
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:17,680
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> argument was well we</font>

705
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:19,600
didn't know he's he's the you know that

706
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,950
this guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tease a senior VP or</font>

707
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,929
something you know he has the rights to

708
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,890
do that you know he's smart great if I

709
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:26,260
could tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you how many smart people</font>

710
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:29,680
I've convinced to click<font color="#E5E5E5"> a free ad email</font>

711
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:32,140
and fish them like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a smart smart and</font>

712
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,480
street smart or two different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font>

713
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,370
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found a bunch of boxes</font>

714
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,230
sitting around and interesting enough we

715
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,129

had spun up because they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test</font>

721
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,209
something like they were staging a

728
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,100
you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened to have a box running</font>

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,990
inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network this is a huge</font>

concern if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside of the network is</font>

731
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:04,679
secure no but if I can access<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

machines from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outside and they're</font>

733
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,610
vulnerable because people are not

00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:11,159
actively maintaining and monitoring them

735
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:15,149
it does open a big gaping hole for us

736
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:16,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so working with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the client we</font>

737
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,419
validated the firewall<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in place and</font>

738
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,129
functioning so we looked at looked at

739
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:21,780
everything was<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's there you're</font>

740
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,940
sure it's running like it it's good to

741
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">go she said all right let's run the</font>

742
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,120
other scan let's see what's you know see

743
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,280
what's popping up it got the same

744
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,659
results so even<font color="#E5E5E5"> went further and said</font>

745
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,240
okay well let me try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scan up the</font>

746
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,919
machine from a host<font color="#E5E5E5"> of VPS so I went on</font>

747
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,080
digitalocean paid five bucks threw up on

748
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:38,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">a booty machine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH to it and just said</font>

749
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay let me just start trying to scan it</font>

750
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:44,699
up remotely didn't get the same results

751
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,928
so now we're stuck in a dilemma is the

752
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,710
qualys free scan that's give me a bad

753
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:50,760
result or is it you know my tool that

754
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm running into solution give me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

755
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,240
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> result given that they're saying the</font>

756
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,650
environment is secure and then we've got

757
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,030
these firewalls in place you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

758
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:59,220
leaning to say well the chances of the

759
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:01,470
the Linux scan results being wrong are

760
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:03,090
probably a lot slimmer it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be</font>

761
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,770
a simple miss configuration maybe some

table<font color="#E5E5E5"> about cross them database and I'm</font>

765
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,049
equipment before but it's a headache and

766
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,730
you probably will touch<font color="#CCCCCC"> it once every</font>

767
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:16,320
six years of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and then you go back</font>

768
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:17,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">and look at it and you forget</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

769
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,379
and you have to read kind of process

770
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,928
through it so that's kind of what we get

771
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,220
so we went<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said oh so the</font>

772
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:25,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">snozberries don't actually taste like</font>

snozberries so will the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Walker reference</font>

774
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:28,559
fair if you don't get it we took the we

775
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,030
take the firewall configs and started

776
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,290
walking backwards and rebuilding it

777
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,700
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out what was going on</font>

778
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,020
it said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay something's something's in</font>

779
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,540
here something you know something just

780
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,220
doesn't make sense it was one of those

781
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,440
moments where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sit there and you kind</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of face palm and you're like there's no</font>

784
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,310
to be the case like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at there</font>

785
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:46,170
you see a rule for here will for their

786
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,850
they have the right rules in place for

787
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:51,300
the proxies they have the right rules in

place for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> openvpn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s they had one</font>

789
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,409
particular rule that really makes sense

790
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,240
we're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so why are you white</font>

00:25:55,410 --> 00:26:00,330
listing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one IP range to have access</font>

792
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">into the network so that kind of threw</font>

793
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,929
us off and that's when it kind of

794
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:06,929
started clicking wait a second you've

795
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:11,250
whitelisted you've whitelisted whole

796

799
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:18,030
bought on Craigslist I mean had actually

800
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,740
not wiped it they simply modified some

801
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,660
of the configurations on it so there was

802
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,550
remnants from the previous user so we

803
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,810
thought maybe just maybe it just

804
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,879
happened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be something left over from</font>

805

previous user but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody in</font>

806
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,970
here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does security work knows that</font>

807
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,160
one if you buy something I'm to

808
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,240
craigslist be very very cautious and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

809

what are the first thing you do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

reinstall the permit they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

here is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pin tester it's a great key to</font>

822
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,560
the castle you've added me to active

823
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,600
directory and now get a bot this is this

824
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,919
is perfect perfect scenario so see the

825
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,270
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a repeat pattern here we started</font>

826
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,280
saying okay well maybe the crazy stuff

827
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:07,500
isn't so crazy let's just really go

828
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,570
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> this Andrea race we had to the</font>

829
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,280
analyst and myself sat down and we kind

830
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,750
of went through these these logs and

831
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll be back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the server room and I</font>

832
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">was so I was doing some data capture and</font>

833
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,670
one of the guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in and he goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

834
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,629
right I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna show you this and don't</font>

835
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:21,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">laugh me because it's been a long time</font>

836
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:24,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">since I've live at juniper is this an</font>

837
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:26,250
allow all rule for this this range he

838
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,050
said yes it is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went back and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

839
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:30,720
okay this in fact isn't allowed all rule

840
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:32,310
so this this whitelisted rains that they

841
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,380
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically was allow any</font>

842
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:36,540
incoming and outcoming traffic into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

843
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,800
router without any authentication the

844
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,990
only authentication required was simply

845
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:43,760
that IP was the originating source

846
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:46,790
so everyone gets a trophy here if you

847
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:51,950
can guess where this is going it turns

848
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:55,810
out that the configuration was set up

849
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:59,180
for whitelisting<font color="#CCCCCC"> qualis of scam service</font>

850
00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:01,460
why would you whitelist the server's of

851
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,890
a scan tool in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your internal network so</font>

852
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,940
it really make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense to me and I started</font>

853
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking well no actually it makes</font>

854
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,930
absolute sense at some point somebody

855
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,729
had a budget constraint they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing</font>

856
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,170
to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a koala services but maybe</font>

857
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,760
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay for the internal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hosted</font>

858
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,140
because they didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the finance or</font>

859
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,180
maybe a creative sales guy in the other

00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">side said hey I've got this product here</font>

861
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,930
I know you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need internal scanning</font>

862
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,460
but check this out if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> open up and</font>

863
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:25,220
white list these IPS that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I give you</font>

864
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,480
I'll give you rather you'll be able to

865
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">do an internal scan with our external</font>

866
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,420
tool and I think in this particular

867
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,740
instance that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's happen so here I</font>

873
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:45,830
we run into here is that with<font color="#CCCCCC"> qualis a</font>

free scan and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> paid scan levers the</font>

nature is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong it's a fantastic</font>

877
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,260
product they have to have a barrage of

878

servers that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using to constantly</font>

879
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,770
do these vulnerability scans and do<font color="#E5E5E5"> 24-7</font>

880
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,470
checks there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font>

881
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:02,270
design in that architecture anybody can

882
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:03,500
sign up for screen free scan there's

883
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:05,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing wrong with that because at the</font>

884
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,230
end of the day a koala scan is no

885
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,850
different than<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything you can do from</font>

886
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:10,160
your own computer if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are touching</font>

887
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:11,899
the wide area network on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

888
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,040
you've got to expect you're getting skin

889
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,380
I mean how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are here probably</font>

890
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,270
get popped every 20 seconds looking for

891
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,220
random exploits my favorite or are the

892
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:20,780
guys in China that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are throwing you know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">non-stop not wondering why the not get</font>

00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,980
anywhere I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean you see the stuff all</font>

896
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,260
day like so<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's not uncommon</font>

897
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:30,170
scanning is there so once again no false

898
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:32,900
i'm flawless for doing that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

899
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:35,330
part anybody can scan any IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> once again</font>

900
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">why not an IP is you know into public</font>

901
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:38,600
information you can scan<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IP what does</font>

902
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:40,370
koalas have to do to stop you from

scanning sure they<font color="#CCCCCC"> may stop it our</font>

905
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,090
you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna get the full scan so</font>

906
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:49,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially what happens is in this</font>

907
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:54,408
particular instance because they had

908
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:56,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">white listed the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> qualys scans network</font>

909
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:58,940
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I went through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and created our fake</font>

910
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:03,289
throwie accounts and I scan their IP as

911
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:04,399
a free user I had full recon of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

912
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:06,200
whole network and I had the full

913
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,840
vulnerability ad network maps I had all

914
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,230
the topology<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I could generate from</font>

915
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,309
this simple scam because at some point a

916
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,570
security analyst said hey I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to save</font>

917
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:16,309
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> money I'm gonna open up this white</font>

918
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:18,168
list and because of that as an attacker

919
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:20,330
I know how this whole plethora of

920
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:22,850
information about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network for low</font>

921
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:25,490
low price of free it's pretty pretty big

922
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:27,529
concern so the moral the story is is

923
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,700
that we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to face security</font>

924
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:30,259
assessments we have to do with security

925
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,029
audits and we have to work through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

926
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:34,549
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things often times with no time</font>

927
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:36,049
no funding and no budget but I implore

928
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:37,759
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion and think</font>

929
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:40,129
about this because while this is a very

930
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:41,509
low tech talk in principle I think

931
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,799
everyone here once again<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

932
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:45,200
audit or an analyst is going to agree

933
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,759
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that here is a product</font>

934
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,470
that's actually being used the right way

935
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:50,210
can be leveraged maliciously is the

936
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:53,690
simple mindset of a hacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> to begin with</font>

937
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:55,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">so whitelisting hosted solution on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

938
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:58,779
outside to use it internally it is not

939
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,980
not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best solution so with that is</font>

940
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:03,350
any questions you may have about

941
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,480
security incident response consulting or

942
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:07,248
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our experiences this is a very</font>

943
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">short</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk like to keep it short and</font>

944
00:31:07,249 --> 00:31:11,299
sweet because I know how they go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

945
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:15,320
overwhelm us you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have questions</font>

946
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:16,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">hey so that's why it you brought in</font>

947
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,000
originally

948
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:20,790
they have been breached a music that's

949
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,790
correct was the thought that attacker

950
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:25,560
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can discover the quality posted</font>

951
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,060
through they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> using no not that had</font>

952
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,110
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> really to do with anything be at</font>

953
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:30,120
the other day it was simply just a

954
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,439
resource so you know incident responses

955
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,939
is interesting because everyone's gonna

956
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,530
have their own playbook everybody has

957
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,480
like an is standard to have a guideline

958
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:37,920
you can read a report from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mandy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

959
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,260
can report from us you can read a report

960
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,920
from just about any firm out there and

961
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,870
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably all gonna look</font>

962
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,850
different about the approach it it's all

963
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,290
tools techniques and procedures we all

964
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,730
have unique tradecraft we have unique

965
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,500
tools that we like to run through in

966
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:51,570
this particular instance we knew that

967
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was an internal compromise we had</font>

968
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to visibility to level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

969
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:57,419
exfiltration level<font color="#E5E5E5"> three kind of</font>

970
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,889
exfiltration<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac bones that were being</font>

971
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,450
leveraged by this thread actor we had

972
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,400
visibility into it and so because we

973
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">could see all this different traffic we</font>

974
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,430
didn't always<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the origination point</font>

975
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,320
because of staging so what I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

976
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:08,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is there was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always a middleman</font>

977
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,980
that we may not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

978
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:12,750
IP that exfiltrated data came from which

979
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,520
would potentially have logs of the

980
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:16,520
source we didn't have visibility into

981
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:19,379
that so all we actually had were

982
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,370
usernames credentials and domain names

983
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,330
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> things like that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of course</font>

984
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:23,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">through the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> power of open source</font>

985
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:25,199
intelligence we were able to eventually

986
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,720
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> who the client was notify</font>

987
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,400
them but given that we had no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of</font>

988
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">how they potentially got breached the</font>

989
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,870
most logical was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a site of fishing or</font>

990
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:35,669
vulnerabilities of popping it because

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat actor that we did find in</font>

992
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:40,380
there that we are monitoring they have a

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">very specific set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of skills a very</font>

995
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,270
could actually tell which level of

996
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:50,460
operator or exploit exploit for the team

997
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:52,139
is doing the engagement simply based

998
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,310
upon the way they move you can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

999
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,600
they're running scripts versus when

1000
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:56,610
they're kind of going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fly trying</font>

1001

to do sequel injection on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own and</font>

1002
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:59,879
find vulnerabilities so in this

1003
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,090
particular instance this was the very

1004
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,130
early stage evidence that we had of kind

1005
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:07,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like a spray</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and pray environment so</font>

1006
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:09,690
for us getting on site and having a very

limited access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> one there was</font>

1009
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,560

1011
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,159
understand the network we had legacy

hardware that have been inherited they

1013
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,169
had no clue<font color="#E5E5E5"> really about and then</font>

1014
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:25,360
had devices they had been behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> her</font>

1016
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,959
that we had to grasp but whatever

1017
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:30,909
intelligence we could find I think in

1018
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,380
Indian a response world a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it is</font>

00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:34,510
thrown a bunch of hypothesis is on the

00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:36,010
wall and<font color="#E5E5E5"> been working back and kind of</font>

1021
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:37,750
through deductive analysis saying okay

1022
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,950
we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that would destroy</font>

1023
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,120
this narrative and destroy this

narrative to help kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hone in</font>

1025
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,168
otherwise in an environment like this

00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can go in for instant response and</font>

1027
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:46,900
as a lot of a lot of our competitors

1028
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,370
would do they would go in and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1029
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,929
well you've got a corporate network we

1030
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:51,039
don't know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of breach we're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to immediately charged it you know</font>

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,658
5,000 hours and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take 48</font>

1033
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,880
hours per system well it does take 48

1034
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:59,950
hours per system I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5,000 hours work</font>

1035
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">upfront that's not needed as 5,000 hours</font>

1036
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,020
of work this time eating well

1037
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:04,149
importantly who's going to have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

1038
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do all that work most of us are on</font>

1039
00:34:04,149 --> 00:34:08,230
backlogs I the average instant response

1040
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:09,279
to be two to three<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks for some of the</font>

1041
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,659
firm's before they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out there</font>

1042
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,159
simply because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the amount of breaches</font>

1043
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:13,450
that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so we kind of do a</font>

1044
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,980
different methodical approach to where

1045
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:16,449
we go and we say we know it was attacked

1046
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:19,119
and we kind of build backwards to kind

1047
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:21,489
of map out the network particularly once

1048
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,750
again from our inherent knowledge of

1049
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:24,908
having works these threat actor groups

1050
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,980
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular group I've been</font>

1051
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:29,379
following iterations of it for 12 years

1052
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:30,969
all right I could and I won't but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1053
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:33,129
could name particular key individuals

1054
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:34,959
who've invested in the people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1055
00:34:33,129 --> 00:34:36,279
doing the attacks particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

1056
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,990
are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> complacent with allowing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1057
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,990
attacks to happen including the fact

1058
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:44,319
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the group</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is run by a</font>

1059
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:45,368
cousin of a local kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dignitary and</font>

1060
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,659
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why they're trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

1061
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:47,800
free<font color="#E5E5E5"> reign and ignis things so it's</font>

1062
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:49,750
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that information in that kind of</font>

1063
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,790
historic experiences to try to figure

1064
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:53,199
out what can we decipher and in this

1065
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,029
instance we said look we don't know

1066
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,279
anything about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the external gateway and</font>

1067
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:58,900
you can't provide it so simply using a

1068
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,339
free tool that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> there it did</font>

1069
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">something for me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I didn't have the</font>

1070
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:04,320
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do I gave me a little bit more</font>

1071
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,320
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font>

1072
00:35:05,779 --> 00:35:10,559
so when I say we're tracking

1073
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,690
nation-state threat actors we're not

1074
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,210
just tracking anybody in everybody we're

1075
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,650
tracking the highest of the high so when

1076
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,910
I work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the national security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agency</font>

1077
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:20,220
I worked in a division called tailored

1078
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:22,319
access operations I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

1079
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,788
into the elaborate of too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

1080
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:25,200
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> but basically that was the</font>

1081
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:27,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer network exploitation attack</font>

1082
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,069
division within their I focus

1083
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:32,460
specifically on counter computer network

1084
00:35:29,069 --> 00:35:34,349
exploitation so without getting too

1085
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,079
technical my job was to understand and

1086
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:38,519
hack the hackers right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not always</font>

1087
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:39,900
easy to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the victims but if you can</font>

1088
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:42,689
attack the attacker and figure out what

1089
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,430
they're doing you can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get an end</font>

1090
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,440
result<font color="#E5E5E5"> so going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through that a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1091
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:48,839
times we had to qualify and quantify

1092
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,039
what a threat level is from an attacker

1093
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:51,150
right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get your script kiddies I</font>

1094
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:52,289
think we've all seen that you've got

1095
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,940
some simple things that Norton is going

1096
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:55,319
to catch or whatever security gateway

1097
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,309
and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your persistent attackers</font>

1098
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,200
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get in they're going</font>

1099
00:35:56,309 --> 00:35:59,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">to drop one tool it's going to be memory</font>

00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,519
box which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys actually do</font>

1102
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,079
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to guess wants to get internal</font>

1103
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:05,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">access and then they're gonna use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1105
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,249
against you they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> recon they're</font>

1106
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:09,569
pulling down your historic orts that you

1107

shared in the documents and<font color="#E5E5E5"> drives and</font>

1108
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:13,349
they're building a network map so if you

1109
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,509
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> nation-state people like that</font>

1110
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:17,700
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the time the expertise and the</font>

1112
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:24,480
I'm tracking between 240 and 243

1113
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:26,308
different discernible groups and these

1114
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,869
are people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> well funded and have the</font>

1115
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,700
resources many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them are actually</font>

1116
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:30,839
next-door neighbors and competing what's

1117
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,399
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you can find in some of</font>

1118
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:34,349
the military kind of organizations that

1119
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">are fighting you've got one unit here</font>

1123
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:41,759
fight each other you can sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

each other's tools out you know and

1126
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:46,589
totally destroy restoring the access but

1127
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:48,180
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually doesn't sound all that</font>

1128
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:50,249
crazy because if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it here</font>

1129
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,049
even within the us as we stood up Cyber

competing so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually not that</font>

1136
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:05,339
crazy so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it I a 243</font>

1137
00:37:03,779 --> 00:37:06,450
sounds like a lot when you realize how

1138
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:07,980
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> countries are out there and how</font>

1139
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:10,169
cheap it is for anybody to buy an

1140
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,339
exploit toolkit I mean just call<font color="#E5E5E5"> Boop in</font>

1141
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,049
and say hey I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy a couple zero</font>

1142
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:14,330
days and here's hack team they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font>

00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,770
a couple hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand dollars but we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">tools why we have the intelligence on</font>

that we partner with other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who do</font>

we like to consider ourselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time operationally staging</font>

1160
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,439
rather than throwing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> honey pot you've</font>

gotta live network that's been breached

1162
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,290
let's mitigate it as best we can

1163
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,490
internally but the intelligence that

is going to be far greater than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the risk</font>

1166

1168
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,340
because at the end of the day everyone

1169
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,900
the operations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we work on benefits</font>

prior clients we have in current clients

1171
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:03,080
we have because the change of techniques

<font color="#E5E5E5">and procedures between each operation</font>

1173
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,590
gives us a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> mo to look at and so we</font>

this new briefs they use the new tool

1176
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,960
maybe we can find variants of it that we

hadn't realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> were there before so</font>

answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> another one that's a very tough</font>

1183
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,509
we've got a lot of relationships and

partners<font color="#CCCCCC"> in industry that we've worked</font>

1185
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:34,070
with I can count them on the hand the

1186
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,080
ones that I trust and I know that sounds

1187
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:37,820
bad but in the environment that I've

1188

worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two places i've been at you</font>

1190
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">know in the NSA it's a very close-knit</font>

1192
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,100
are now I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got security teams</font>

00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,660
you've got that trust relationship the

1196
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:52,040
one thing that we see that's consistent

1197
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,509
though is that is the vascular dreaded

1198
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,490
products simply don't work or people

1199

can't figure out how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use them so we</font>

companies and kind of share information

1202
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,220
obviously because there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,750
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out of it and more</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">importantly we tend to tend to pick up a</font>

bet you instead I would just you know

say do something cool with it or

1270
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:30,220
whatever or maybe no don't tell me so

1271
00:41:28,329 --> 00:41:32,020
that's kind of questions any other

00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,720
questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a super sponsors doesn't</font>

actually take the time to go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1280
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,170
lot of it to figure out why this<font color="#E5E5E5"> team</font>

1281
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,430
because at the other day I didn't have

1282
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:50,230
any issue with Wallace whether it was

1283
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:52,868
publicly available or not there was no

1284
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:55,240
fault on there in it doesn't impact

1285
00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:56,319
operations whatsoever it would make

00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense they would have that because</font>

1287
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:00,040
potentially somebody else scans your

1288
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,970
network because they use the free scan

1289
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,319
you're going to want to know who<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1291
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:07,300
go back to figure it out but but as a

1292
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,400
whole that's just an interesting

1293
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,630
situation to be and I you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I here we</font>

all know that like Lego bricks stacked

1299
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,269
together they build a bigger picture

skating equipment we've got partner

1329
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,979
since we're working on to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to</font>

1330
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:10,089
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if these are the kinds of things</font>

1332
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:12,999
knowledge the way that we improve things

1333
00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:14,799
and we mitigate a lot of these threats

1334
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:15,939
is by sharing that and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I think</font>

1335
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:17,710
we've got to get over this I'm the

1336
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:19,299
coolest guy in the office I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1337
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:20,529
to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> my experiences my exposure and</font>

1338
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:21,788
instead we have to start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1339
00:43:20,529 --> 00:43:23,470
it because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're going to</font>

1340
00:43:21,789 --> 00:43:25,029
find us as we talk more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more is that</font>

1341
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,618
we're all victims the same kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tools</font>

1342
00:43:25,029 --> 00:43:29,829
techniques and patterns and if we

1343
00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:32,499
collectively you know kind of solidify

1344
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:33,609
our techniques of detection will make a

1345
00:43:32,499 --> 00:43:36,218
little bit harder for the attackers and

1346
00:43:33,609 --> 00:43:38,560
make them move on to the next guy that's

1347
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:49,090
that's one last little plug there then

1348
