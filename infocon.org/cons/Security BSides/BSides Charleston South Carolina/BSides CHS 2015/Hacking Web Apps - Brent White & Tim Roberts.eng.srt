white<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i'm tim roberts and basically</font>

4
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,500
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to talk about today is</font>

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,849
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's getting into info sack or</font>

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,099
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're a developer and you want</font>

7
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,570
to figure out what to be kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

8
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,190
path to take to start running out of

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,500
secure your own applications and code

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,599
we're going to basically walk through

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,140
what happens all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way from client</font>

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,760
kickoff to report delivery and so it'll

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a lot of high-level information but</font>

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,079
definitely enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get you in the</font>

15
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,079
right direction to assessing web apps

16
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:57,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things when you guys</font>

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,460
do your<font color="#CCCCCC"> kick-off call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> usually this</font>

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,590
happens after a client everything

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,969
decided on your statement of work the

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,190
kickoff call kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bridges the gap</font>

21
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,979
from the actual penetration assessment

22
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,020
and and that statement of work so during

23
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,570
this call it's often<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're</font>

24
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,820
developing the rules of engagement

25
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:17,429
that's when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you discuss</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scoping you</font>

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,369
discuss limitations and your points of

27
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,759
contact so let's say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know for the</font>

28
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,830
scoping if it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI kind of assessment</font>

29
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,810
then some you know the sculpting<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be</font>

30
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,979
broader or bigger so these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind</font>

31
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,750
of questions you want to ask your client

32
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,490
is what are you guys looking at why<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

33
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,380
you doing this assessment is it just for

34
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,560
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> checkbox or you know do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

35
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">deep dive and also during this for the</font>

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,720
point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> contacts this is for both the</font>

37
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,700
client contacts and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,890
testers so if you were to knock<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a</font>

39
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,899
box<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the application who do you</font>

40
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,520
contact during that time or who do they

41
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,910
contact how do you get in touch with

42
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,429
each other and you'll also do the limits

43
00:01:53,910 --> 00:02:00,179
as far as when is the testing is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

44
00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:01,649
to do automated scanning 24<font color="#E5E5E5"> by 7 or is a</font>

45
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:03,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">production environment and they only</font>

46
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,300
want the heavier automated stuff done

47
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,880
after hours things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font>

48
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">also want to make sure to ask the client</font>

49
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,840
hey are there any pages or functions

50
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,060
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want is to avoid you know maybe</font>

51
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,860
there's a contact form that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

52
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,180
an automated scanner on it some poor

53
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,819
soul is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have thousands of</font>

54
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">emails in their inbox so you want to</font>

55
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,738
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask those things and get</font>

56
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,179
those details from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the start</font>

57
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,459
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to keep in mind is that</font>

58
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,099
at the end of every assessment a report

59
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:36,310
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be expected and I only</font>

60
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:39,160
mentioned this because when I started

61
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,709
the job I made the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mistake of not</font>

62
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,329
collecting enough evidence and so while

63
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,739
I was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write the report I</font>

64
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,160
realized there were several things that

65
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:51,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">I didn't document fully and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

66
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,440
know had to like a dog tucking its tail

67
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,809
had to go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client say hey I</font>

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,910
know the assessments over but it's not

69
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,340
really because I screwed<font color="#E5E5E5"> up can I have</font>

70
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:03,160
some more time can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide more</font>

71
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,079
access and so just to save you from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

72
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,590
embarrassment just keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

73
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:12,489
they will expect a report and document

74
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:15,489
as much stuff as possible and as far as

75
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:17,500
documentation goes as well Brent had

76
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:19,420
done a web application talk before<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

77
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">qsa approached him afterwards and said</font>

78
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,369
hey you know pci stuff something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

79
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,739
see a lot of is pen test report will

80
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,329
come in for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pci requirement and it</font>

81
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,069
doesn't mention anything about<font color="#E5E5E5"> pci</font>

82
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:31,720
doesn't have the olas checklist it

83
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:33,700
doesn't have anything like that in the

84
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,910
report so I've had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> decline those</font>

85
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,798
reports for<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI requirements so that</font>

86
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,910
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a mention for this</font>

87
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,970
and whenever you guys are doing these

88
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,829
reports again go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the scope why</font>

89
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,739
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing this what is the client</font>

90
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:49,060
wanting and try to tailor it to help

91
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:51,160
them when they're presenting for

92
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,440
auditors and things like that yeah and

93
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">you also make sure to mention see</font>

attempts at the OAuth top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 put on</font>

95
00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:01,209
there of the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 things what did they</font>

96
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:03,880
pass what did they fail mention when the

97
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:06,790
assessment took place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also mention</font>

98
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:09,459
what the whole the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole goal of the</font>

99
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,470
project was and what you look for so

100
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:15,910
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things will help your report from</font>

101
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:18,130
being rejected from USA as far as

102
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,709
evidence gathering again something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

103
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,860
I use will a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us use keep notes</font>

104
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:26,080
keep note as a nice built-in kind of

105
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,389
project manager put folders and

106
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,370
subfolders you can paste screenshots and

107
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:32,590
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a nice reference to</font>

108
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,289
keep going back to as you're performing

109
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,899
your assessment so you remember hey

110
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:39,300
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> request huh what was my HTTP request</font>

111
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:41,610
what was this or that screenshots things

112
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,219
and a great thing one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reasons i</font>

113
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,499
prefer keep note 2 is that if a client

114
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:48,659
wants to see all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your raw data you</font>

115
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:50,699
know outside of the report all you have

116
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:53,490
to do with this is just export it as

117
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,990
HTML and you can just give everything to

118
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,149
them so they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> having to install a</font>

119
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,610
new program to see all your<font color="#CCCCCC"> files</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

120
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:01,080
it's also available it comes

121
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,080
pre-installed in cali but it's also

122
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,839
available for<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OSX platform</font>

123
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,289
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and just to kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give you an</font>

124
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:14,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea of how I group things how I collect</font>

125
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:16,740
evidence is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see so if i</font>

126
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:19,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">have several hosts that i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

127
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,360
for for an assessment then i might group

128
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,180
it by the host so on the left side<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

129
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,879
can see each host has its own folder and

130
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:31,080
then each vulnerability<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> under</font>

131
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:32,939
that host or if it's just one or two or

132
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,818
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know easy enough to keep up with</font>

133
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:37,860
I'll just group it by vulnerability I've

134
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:39,419
changed how I've done this several times

135
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,459
over the years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this seems to be the</font>

136
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:43,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">method I've stuck with the longest so</font>

137
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:46,080
you'll just kind of figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you go</font>

138
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:48,419
what works best<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you and you can also</font>

139
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">see I've color coded them and this gives</font>

140
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:52,349
me just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick visual reference of kind</font>

141
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:54,990
of the state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the application or where</font>

142
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:57,870
I'm at so like the darker red would be

143
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,939
your high or criticals and then the red

144
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,809
would be your serious yellow would be

145
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:05,789
medium<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on the green I know the</font>

146
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:07,589
green isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vulnerability but it's</font>

147
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:09,808
just reference information for me so

148
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:11,219
this scope or credentials or something

149
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:14,189
that I might might need to click on

150
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:16,289
quickly again this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just personal</font>

151
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:17,639
preference so it's going to be you're

152
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:19,349
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what works best</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

153
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,860
you yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> because this is to help you</font>

154
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:25,050
stay on track you know also<font color="#E5E5E5"> with with</font>

155
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,839
this you can include checklist you can I

156
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,039
mean there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do keep note</font>

157
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,360
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Brent mentioned there's a</font>

158
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,699
lot of commercial stuff out there you

159
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,979
can get and there's freeware as well and

160
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:38,669
you might find out you like you're just

161
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:41,099
using Microsoft Word as well sorry so

162
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:44,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">evidence-gathering what do you document</font>

163
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:47,669
so make sure that you document all of

164
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:50,819
your get and post requests as well as

165
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:52,378
the full response and this will allow

166
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">the client whenever they're going</font>

167
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:56,729
through the remediation process they can

168
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:58,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically copy and paste and try to you</font>

169
00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:00,419
know get the same results that you got

170
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:04,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">and this just helps them to see</font>

171
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:07,049
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did to get and find that</font>

172
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,819
vulnerability also you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to document</font>

173
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,579
any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of unscheduled downtime so</font>

174
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,629
let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do knock over a system</font>

175
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:14,789
application or something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

176
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:16,050
you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client messes up and</font>

177
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:18,839
you're not unable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate with</font>

178
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">the application now you know you want to</font>

179
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:24,419
document that kind of stuff you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

180
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:25,558
also document any kind of changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

181
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:28,169
you've made so let's say you've made

182
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:29,879
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> accounts you uploaded this some</font>

183
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:32,308
sequel injection created some accounts

184
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:33,689
or modified some tables or something you

185
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:35,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's documented</font>

186
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:37,439
so that you can go back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> clean up any</font>

187
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,349
mess that you love yeah there have been

188
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,610
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> times where we've been able to put</font>

189
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:44,039
scripts and your shell scripts or

190
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,589
something on the the client on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the host</font>

191
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:48,719
but we weren't able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually remove</font>

192
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:50,279
those ourselves so you definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

193
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:52,558
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell the client if you've put a shell</font>

194
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:55,759
script on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the host and don't leave it</font>

195
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:58,019
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something bad happens so</font>

196
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,990
another thing I've actually seen people

197
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:02,729
get in trouble for this don't post any

198
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,860
pictures of any hacks that you do from

199
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:06,779
for a client website if you do want to

200
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it make sure you sanitize it so</font>

201
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:11,430
that it's not obvious where it came from

202
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,169
just to cover yourself and any

203
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:18,149
non-disclosure agreements that you might

204
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:19,649
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> under you also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font>

205
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:21,839
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting relevant legible</font>

206
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:24,240
screenshots of whatever vulnerabilities

207
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:27,899
are coming across so whether it's your

208
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,300
HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> request and in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> response headers or</font>

209
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:31,759
it's a

210
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,589
database or anything like that anything

211
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put in the report you want to make</font>

212
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:38,089
sure it helps the client to not only see

213
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:40,250
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> did but go back and be able to</font>

214
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:44,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">duplicate that once they've done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

215
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:46,220
remediation efforts so an example this

216
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a database dump that I did through</font>

217
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,420
sequel injection there were there's so

218
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,819
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> information that I knew okay no</font>

219
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter what I do I can't put all of this</font>

220
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,740
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I sanitize this enough to</font>

221
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:00,709
put in the report you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to consider</font>

222
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:03,620
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this image is going to be have to</font>

223
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:05,268
fit in a printable area for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a report so</font>

224
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,250
when you squeeze that down it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

225
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:09,649
be hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> black background</font>

226
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the green text so what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

227
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:14,240
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do in this case if there's a</font>

228
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,040
small area that you can zoom in on where

229
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,769
you can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of make it a bigger screen</font>

230
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:23,569
like a bigger area for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> report that's</font>

231
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:26,600
fine or copy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> paste this in the</font>

232
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:30,079
report and if so on the next slide you

233
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,760
can see for example any code or anything

234
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:35,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have that sexual code that we've</font>

235
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,790
sent it received or for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sequel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dump</font>

236
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,149
for instance I would copy and I would

237
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:43,370
paste that in the code area so the

238
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:44,630
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see it so you just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

239
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,120
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that whatever you're putting</font>

240
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,310
in there is easily readable for the

241
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,470
client you know if we go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

242
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,420
screenshot you'll see like there's 240

243
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,220
entries in this so obviously you don't

244
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to include everything that you find</font>

245
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,060
you can just include a snippet prove

246
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:01,220
your point you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to</font>

247
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:06,890
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire database in the report</font>

248
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:08,540
obviously you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to list all known</font>

249
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,610
affected pages and parameters for

250
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,779
vulnerabilities the reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you</font>

251
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,810
know sometimes you'll just put one

252
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:17,120
parameter on there let's say you ran a

253
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nessus something like that and you're</font>

254
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,839
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well that looks vulnerable you</font>

255
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,800
go and you test that parameter and now

256
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,750
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that parameter</font>

257
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">did you look at you know all the</font>

258
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,829
affected pages and all the parameters on

259
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,390
there do they know to look at that or

260
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:33,140
they just know to look at the username

261
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:35,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">filter or something right so again back</font>

262
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,790
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this screen user name is vulnerable</font>

263
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:40,430
to sequel injection make sure you also

264
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,360
test password<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that vulnerable sequel</font>

265
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:45,899
injection or any other parameters that

266
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,370
might be in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> as Tim mentioned so if</font>

267
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:49,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">username is vulnerable and it's a</font>

268
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,810
password happens to be vulnerable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

269
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,899
make sure the report<font color="#CCCCCC"> your listing all</font>

270
00:10:51,810 --> 00:11:01,859
parameters that are vulnerable to sequel

271
00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:03,540
injection for example so oh go ahead Tim

272
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,240
oh yeah so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> evidence gathering the</font>

273
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:08,189
methodology the checklist if you're new

274
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,610
to this stuff you know where do I start

275
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,410
what do I test there's there's a lot of

276
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,510
nice checklists out there you know we

277
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,949
mentioned earlier a lost you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you</font>

278
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,540
can if you don't have a methodology that

279
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,390
you follow within your organization if

280
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,310
you are pen tester you know just do look

281
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,709
online there's there's tons of stuff a

282
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:28,050
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of references out there something</font>

283
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:30,060
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps is obviously it helps</font>

284
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:32,760
you with your keeping track just like

285
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep note that helps with consistency</font>

286
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,610
with your recording with your testing

287
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:40,980
and also when you do this even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though it</font>

288
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,839
helps it can also limit you so whenever

289
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,579
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make these chocolates or you go</font>

290
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,170
by keep in mind to think outside of the

291
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,479
box don't just limit yourself to a

292
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,339
checklist security I think I can speak

293
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,990
to Brent as well but checklist security

294
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:53,459
is kind of a joke right it's like oh we

295
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">just want to check box to say we did</font>

296
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:57,060
this assessment or we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go</font>

297
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:00,120
through this list and you're like a

298
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,949
robot yours you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running a script it's</font>

299
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">not like that we're you know as hackers</font>

300
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:06,959
as pen testers<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were creative we think</font>

301
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:09,930
outside of the box we want to find new

302
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:14,310
ways of exploiting this stuff so make

303
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:15,689
sure you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> limit yourself above</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

304
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,359
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to start getting into</font>

305
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:20,970
more of the actual assessment part of

306
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,130
the talk so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

307
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:24,630
like to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> off with is looking at</font>

308
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:28,589
what's out there on the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> already</font>

309
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:30,269
so open source intelligence several

310
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:32,190
tools out there again this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's open</font>

311
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:34,529
source it's free it's amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you</font>

312
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:38,940
can find a bit keep in time it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

313
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:40,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">time consuming so there there have</font>

314
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,019
actually been several times where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

315
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,569
found through old development forums

316
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:47,760
user names like<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests user names and</font>

317
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,810
passwords that they gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people that</font>

318
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,810
they were wanting them to help

319
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,760
troubleshoot an issue they had and those

320
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,890
credentials were still valid and

321
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,680
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go and log into their</font>

322
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:02,060
database so there or it database schemas

323
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:04,920
or anything so look for those things and

324
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:07,709
developers it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's cool to get help</font>

325
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,270
you know with dev dev forms and things

326
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,580
like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure when you do post</font>

327
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:13,980
something for getting help that you

328
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:16,380
sanitize that and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> for whatever reason</font>

329
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,330
if you do provide access to someone that

330
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,130
can come in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at your code make</font>

331
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:23,970
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you disable that once they are</font>

332
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:25,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">finished so that guys like us don't find</font>

333
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:29,610
it and give you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> terrible report</font>

334
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:32,130
afterwards so also you know he was

335
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,780
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the developer forums a lot</font>

336
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the internal application assessments</font>

337
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:38,430
that we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come across</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

338
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:40,200
developer wiki and that wiki a lot of

339
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,699
times is there's a treasure trove of

340
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,070
information as<font color="#CCCCCC"> far as the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

341
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,920
applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're using like he said</font>

342
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:49,800
test accounts and things like that in

343
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,990
different table names and paths so don't

344
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,490
overlook that kind of stuff like all<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

345
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,590
developer<font color="#E5E5E5"> Winkies it's just the</font>

346
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,870
developer environment it's not

347
00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:00,270
production it's not relevant well the

348
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,400
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I personally come across</font>

349
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:04,020
accounts that are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

350
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,340
development environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> as they are in</font>

351
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,319
the production so when they rolled over

352
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,300
they forgot<font color="#E5E5E5"> about those a test</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accounts</font>

353
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,340
so this has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> count still exists so I</font>

354
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,229
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep that in mind yeah you know</font>

355
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,660
when finding those accounts to fruit

356
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,580
through google or archived email forums

357
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,310
or things those give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> usernames that</font>

358
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:23,730
you can go and<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to brute force</font>

359
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:24,900
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the app so again we</font>

360
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,330
like we just mentioned we found the

361
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:30,390
database types full schemas test

362
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:33,360
credentials and things in the wild that

363
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:35,189
were still relevant so just keep that in

364
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:41,010
mind and look for developers keep in

365
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:42,840
mind to clean that stuff up a few more

366
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,580
few more tools again there's so many

367
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,950
tools out there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a few that that</font>

368
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,560
we like to use on a regular basis we

369
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,870
really like discover by Lee Bayard as

370
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,939
you can see some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the options that are</font>

371
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:57,570
available to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you can quickly scan for</font>

372
00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:00,330
a domain active<font color="#CCCCCC"> passive searching you</font>

373
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:03,210
can put in the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> name and the</font>

374
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">domain as well or specific person and so</font>

375
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,120
on

376
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,880
as well as other cool tools if you need

377
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,200
to parse<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML start a listener several</font>

378
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">things just make it kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of quick and</font>

379
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,810
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you so you know he mentioned</font>

380
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:19,980
other tools there's a meta goof all

381
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:22,689
right there there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mouse a go</font>

382
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:26,320
harvester there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

383
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:27,610
tools out there 40 st. gathering so keep

384
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,130
that in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't limit yourself to</font>

385
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,510
just one tool either one tool may just

386
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,830
have a limited<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of features while</font>

387
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,500
another one may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

388
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:40,690
one this so try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use multiple tools</font>

389
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:43,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">what is going why do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run automated</font>

390
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:46,990
tools you're supposed to be a hacker

391
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:49,599
well one of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do is we</font>

392
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:52,900
run these tools for the sake of time so

393
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,500
unlike real life where a hacker may have

394
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:59,230
several months or years or whatever to

395
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,940
sit there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> upon this as pen</font>

396
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,040
testers often we're given a short amount

397
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:06,610
of testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> window so like a week on</font>

398
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,469
eighty two weeks so in that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> often run</font>

399
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,600
the automated tools then we'll go back

400
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:12,220
and we'll do some manual stuff and then

401
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,320
we'll start testing the false positives

402
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,810
from the automated tools so even though

403
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">nessus may tell you this is vulnerable</font>

404
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:21,729
to cross-site scripting well you go to

405
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,709
it you test the parameter nothing is put

406
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,870
happening well what's why is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

407
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:27,880
popping up did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> e pop-ups off is</font>

408
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:30,130
Java disabled and you're a script

409
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,890
disabled in your browser I look at that

410
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:34,780
stuff but also is a report<font color="#CCCCCC"> just throwing</font>

411
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:37,449
out a false positive saying this is

412
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:40,089
vulnerable in all it is it's tripping on

413
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,680
one of the the code or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tick or</font>

414
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:43,720
something yeah so automated scanning

415
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,160
really just a quick way to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wide</font>

416
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,170
range of tests<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find a lot of</font>

417
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">low-hanging fruit and kind of gives you</font>

418
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:53,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">a against a game plan if it's showing</font>

419
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:57,790
things of how you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to attack the</font>

420
00:16:53,230 --> 00:17:00,430
application after that so in something

421
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:02,500
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stress is that a bone</font>

422
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:05,050
scan is not a penetration assessment

423
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:09,040
everybody together yeah a bone scan is

424
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:11,079
not a penetration assessment and we we

425
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,438
see this a long time from larger firms

426
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:16,889
that will sell packages where it's

427
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:19,680
basically a vulnerability scan and they

428
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:21,420
off as pen test well it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's vuong</font>

429
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,310
scan a gun is going to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

430
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,720
false positives it's not going to have

431
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:27,208
that human interaction and it's not

432
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,760
going to go as deep as you could take it

433
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:32,160
for certain vulnerabilities so please

434
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,500
keep that in mind be good stewards and

435
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,220
spread the word to anybody that says

436
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:42,750
that otherwise and to those that say it

437
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:44,880
is I've no idea what I'm doing yeah so

438
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,710
if you guys are receiving 50-page

439
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,890
acunetix dumps or something like that

440
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:51,180
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is your pen test I hate to</font>

441
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:54,630
break the news to you but you're paying

442
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:58,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">for somebody to click go so yeah this is</font>

443
00:17:54,630 --> 00:18:00,780
not a penetration other automated

444
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,610
scanners there's several out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

445
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,639
some of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> quote the ones that we go to</font>

446
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,020
on a regular basis<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we like Nessus i</font>

447
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,120
like to use Nessus because it's you know

448
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:12,090
it does a lot of quick checks on the

449
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:16,110
host level so it'll look<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like CGI</font>

450
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:18,419
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at ssl/tls settings it'll</font>

451
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:21,840
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help find admin portals</font>

452
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:23,580
or backup pages things like that another

453
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing I like to use to get a deeper dive</font>

454
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,990
is ivy and maps can and again there

455
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,360
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> several others out there but</font>

456
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:34,140
just mentioning the ones that that we

457
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,469
use on a regular basis so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know a BM</font>

458
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,850
maps can you can see it it checks for

459
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:41,340
several several things it's a great

460
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:46,649
application and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got a nice web</font>

461
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:48,870
service test module in it too yeah and

462
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,010
then burp suite pro you're going to hear

463
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,530
us reference that quite a few times

464
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:58,070
because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a great tool does a</font>

465
00:18:52,530 --> 00:19:01,500
wide wide variety of testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and things</font>

Nick<font color="#CCCCCC"> too that's also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another built-in</font>

467
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,770
scanner and it comes pre-installed in

468
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:09,000
cali and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do quick scans</font>

469
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:13,889
again for hidden directories well known

admin portals or backup files<font color="#CCCCCC"> cgi</font>

range of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things too so if you if you've</font>

473
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,920
already sort of looked at the

through something quickly instead of

<font color="#E5E5E5">using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three is an automated scanner like</font>

00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,019
Nessus or IPM app

478
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,549
can or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something just run Nick too</font>

479
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:37,110
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty focused and it's</font>

480
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:40,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty quick tool also looking at this</font>

481
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:42,178
identify if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see like frameworks like</font>

482
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:45,809
wordpress or something like that and

00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:47,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">reward you rupal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> WordPress</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font>

485
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:51,480
like a blog management though it on

486
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:53,759
there and developers<font color="#E5E5E5"> here usually get</font>

487
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,580
quite often but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens is as soon</font>

488
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,559
as they hand it off it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> often not</font>

489
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:02,220
maintained so plugins aren't updated

490
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:05,490
they're not updating WordPress or Joomla

491
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,950
or Drupal and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this leaves</font>

492
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">vulnerabilities so make sure if you guys</font>

493
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,919
are our clients and developers are

494
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,529
developing this make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that you have</font>

495
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:16,830
this patch management even on stuff like

496
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:18,870
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us yep out of the box it's okay</font>

497
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:21,059
but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start adding plugins and</font>

498
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:23,070
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to learn techniques how</font>

499
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:25,289
to harden that I don't know as a pen

500
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,509
tester absolutely love<font color="#CCCCCC"> it when i see a</font>

501
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:29,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">client's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using wordpress whether it's on</font>

502
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:32,759
an internal assessment or a web app or

503
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:36,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">something it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good because you</font>

504
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:38,730
can find juicy stuff pretty easy and so

505
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:40,620
built in the cali you have a tools like

506
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:43,470
wordpress scan that specifically scan

507
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:45,719
wordpress for outdated plugins outed

508
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,000
versions you can even even enumerate

509
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">usernames which helps you for brute with</font>

510
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,179
brute forcing later and there's also

511
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:56,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">tools again for like drupal and joomla</font>

512
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:59,159
things like that so they're just focused

513
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:01,440
scanners for those frameworks<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's</font>

514
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:04,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioning some tools here's 10 los pass</font>

515
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,740
a few tools out there is app directory

516
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:10,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">buster this just brute force directories</font>

517
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,870
files etc so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> still not very</font>

518
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">familiar with command line there's some</font>

519
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:18,658
gooeys even for out there for<font color="#E5E5E5"> colleague</font>

520
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,450
yeah in just a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> on door</font>

521
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:23,519
buster sometimes if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hit a</font>

522
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,870
wall<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm kind of finding some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

523
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,779
finding a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> harder</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to find things</font>

524
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:30,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go after what I'll do is I'll run</font>

525
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:33,600
dirt Buster you can specify<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists like</font>

526
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,419
known directory names very large<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists</font>

527
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,330
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> also specify file extensions to</font>

528
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:41,580
look for so if it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> PHP website you can</font>

529
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:44,909
have it look for dot PHP or dot B

530
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:47,790
a pretty popular for people to change

531
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,960
the file extension<font color="#E5E5E5"> sadat bak or similar</font>

532
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,420
things like that and so it will go

533
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">through and it will look for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those and</font>

534
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:56,880
we'll do a numeration like you know air

535
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:58,830
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 response or error 404 and</font>

536
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,740
so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's how it knows if those</font>

537
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:03,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">things exist or not it takes time</font>

538
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,280
especially if you have a large list it's

539
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:07,290
running against but it can really pay

540
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:11,160
off you know also<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can look up like</font>

541
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:13,649
PDF files or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Word documents it's amazing</font>

542
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you'll see a lot of companies will</font>

543
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:18,420
upload their vulnerability scans online

544
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,160
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're externally facing so maybe</font>

545
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,560
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drop in some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dortch</font>

546
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,200
or something or use a tool like this to

547
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,940
start crawling outside for pds or these

548
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,410
documents and looking at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

549
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,940
vulnerabilities in the past there's a

550
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:35,850
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of as brim inch and there's a lot of</font>

551
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,650
stuff in Kali a lot of pre installs if

552
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,540
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it just go to</font>

553
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:41,370
the drop-down menu you'll see web

554
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:44,100
application web vulnerability scanners

555
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:46,770
and tons of things on there in addition

556
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to this you also see other commercially</font>

557
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:51,930
available scanners out there like necks

558
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:54,629
pose and st.<font color="#E5E5E5"> not genetics I mentioned</font>

559
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:56,040
that before there's several tools out

560
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:57,870
there and the ones we're just dropping

561
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,909
again is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools that we prefer</font>

562
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:02,189
that kind of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to but don't limit</font>

563
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:04,110
yourself to just these<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah and it's</font>

564
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:06,240
it's good to use multiple tools because

565
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,709
you'll get different results<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and so you'll get different results a</font>

569
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:17,550
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I continued talking</font>

570
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,380
about automated scanning a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> pro</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tips</font>

571
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:21,240
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want to throw in the URL</font>

00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">and hit go you want to look at the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not going to flood the host with</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">also not enabling denial service checks</font>

578
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:37,890
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've ever had a</font>

579
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,360

580
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:41,280
check for denial of service and knock

581
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,500
something over if you can most of them

582
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,480
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be bothered with that if</font>

583
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,990
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do have a scanner that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> checks for it</font>

584
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,970
then just let them know hey we this is

585
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,760
showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the potential for that is</font>

586
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:54,750
there check it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and some of them will</font>

587
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,150
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

588
00:23:54,750 --> 00:24:00,000
just let us<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if it's there but don't</font>

589
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:01,500
exploit it safe<font color="#CCCCCC"> mode is a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

590
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,780
you'll see safe mode for the denial of

591
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,910
service exploits<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the attempts to run</font>

592
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,100
so what that does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it just checks for</font>

593
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:13,860
the response it doesn't actually deliver

594

600
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,040
getting her inbox flooded by your

601
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,610
automated tools so make sure you exclude

602
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:34,200
that if you have to sign up<font color="#CCCCCC"> pages you</font>

603
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:37,590
know you might need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> specify page not</font>

604
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:41,240
found error to<font color="#E5E5E5"> for false positives so if</font>

605
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:43,980
this is a kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray box or white box</font>

606
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,780
approach to the assessment then you're

607
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,940
in this constant communication with the

608
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,160
client so it's okay to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask them these</font>

609
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,410
kinds of questions if it's a black box

610
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,050
and obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

611
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:57,270
keep testing it manually just to see hey

612
00:24:55,050 --> 00:25:01,200
why is this shooting this air whether

613
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:03,900
the headers look like yeah so anybody in

614
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">here that has done automated scanning</font>

615
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,600
against a website and every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

616
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:12,450
it sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get a response like a like</font>

617
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,090
a at 200 okay that everything it checks

618
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:19,170
for is there has anybody experienced

619
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:22,199
that it's a pain in the butt to clean up

620
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:23,940
and it's a waste of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time so several</font>

621
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,580
automated scanners allow you to go in

622
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,190
and specify<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even though this is</font>

623
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,860
saying 200 ok this is actually their

624
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,960
custom like their customer response to

625
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,909
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that isn't found a lot of</font>

626
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">sites where if you request something</font>

627
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,570
that's not there it will automatically

628
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,640
take you to a home page or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something and</font>

629
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,260
so when you have a scanner<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

630
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,510
sending thousands and thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

631
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,730
requests looking for files it's going to

632
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:49,170
say yeah we're all here but it's not

633
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:53,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">really there so you can actually go and</font>

634
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:55,380
specify a custom I guess you 200 ok but

635
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:58,229
you'd call it like the page not found or

636
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:02,130
whatever the that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scanner calls it</font>

637
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:04,080
so also<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this if you're doing again</font>

638
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,380
if you're doing kind of a disclosed

639
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,870
assessment with the claw

640
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:10,630
and they provide credentials for the

641
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:12,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">site oftentimes instead of just you know</font>

642
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,570
sitting there trying to crack the site

643
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,820
if it's not a black box assessment

644
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're testing windows limited they'll</font>

645
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,899
just provide you a normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> user or an</font>

646
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,340
administrator account and then you can

647
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:25,630
test it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that way they get</font>

648
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:27,520
a more robust view at their application

649
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:29,920
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> whenever you're doing that make sure</font>

650
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,510
that some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these tools</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have macros you</font>

651
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,420
can configure others and just dump

652
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:35,740
usernames and passwords into it but make

653
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,780
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when you're running these</font>

654
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,700
automated scans if you are doing an

655
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,440
authenticated scan that you're not

656
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,940
dumped off so let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're doing it</font>

657
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,040
in the session drops and it's still

658
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,600
running all these scripts well now it's

659
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,610
running and generating a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> errors</font>

660
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,199
because it's the session is no longer

661
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,909
available so make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that those</font>

662
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,370
sessions are still active whenever

663
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:56,650
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing authenticated web builder</font>

664
00:26:54,370 --> 00:27:00,189
builds games and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

665
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:02,170
about IBM the IBM<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps can is that it</font>

666
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:04,660
detects when the session has dropped and

667
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:07,120
it will actually pause itself until it

668
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:09,040
has learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it has authenticated</font>

669
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,790
again and then it will resume so that's

670
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,889
very handy so and then once you've

671
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:18,010
verified everything and you're ready to

672
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:20,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">go then obviously then when you're</font>

673
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:25,930
comfortable then click scan for<font color="#CCCCCC"> or go</font>

674
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:27,550
for it so so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start</font>

675
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:31,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into a little more manual</font>

676
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:33,730
testing so once the scanner is finished

677
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,800
again you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go through</font>

678
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,600
manually verify the results you can't

679
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">rely on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a scanner that everything is</font>

680
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,070
accurate so you want to go through and

681
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:44,740
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at you know the things that are</font>

682
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:46,810
legitimate document those so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

683
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,370
let's say you find cross-site scripting

684
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:51,669
or the scanner finds cross-site

685
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:55,810
scripting is it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's just</font>

686
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:57,370
the alert one or alert XSS see how how

687
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:59,679
much further you can take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you</font>

688
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:02,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">start including in JavaScript where you</font>

689
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:04,870
can activate<font color="#CCCCCC"> a keylogger or you know do</font>

690
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:06,639
some sort of file inclusion or what can

691
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:09,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do to take it further than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just the</font>

692
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,710
alert one and if you do the alert make

693
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,390
it worse the alert do like a document

694
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:14,110
cookie

695
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:16,330
document.cookie or something like that

696
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:18,309
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a session cookie out of it</font>

697
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,559
don't just have it says it's vulnerable

698
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:22,690
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able to make a cross-site</font>

699
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,120
scripting I can make a some pop up and

700
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:27,880
say hey look at me that's not I mean who

701
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,679
cares take it further push yourself

702
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,660
don't limit yourself on just that's what

703
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,820
a vulnerability scanner does don't limit

704
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:36,730
yourself on just that actually you know

705
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:39,010
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pin test it yeah and something to</font>

706
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:40,330
keep in mind to some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font>

707
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,670

708
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:44,919
are maybe sea level<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

709
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:46,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">fully understand what they're looking at</font>

710
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,280
so if they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a one they're going</font>

711
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:50,260
to think okay well why do I care about

712
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but if they see something popping</font>

713
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:54,910
up where it's like okay here is an

714
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:56,678
active keylogger that might you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know get</font>

715
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:58,059
their attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> bore where perhaps the</font>

716
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:01,150
department that's having you do the

717
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:03,850
assessment can get more funding or more

718
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:05,650
budget to actually have more time to fix

719
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,790
these vulnerabilities so just kind of

720
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:09,250
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in mind too when you're</font>

721
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:11,710
writing your report the more I opening

722
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:13,240
the exploit is the better chance that

723
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,800
you're getting executive buy-in to

724
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,260
remediate these issues to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

725
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">client so when you just bring a client a</font>

726
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,740
you know earlier I mentioned just

727
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">dumping a vulnerability scan and saying</font>

728
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:28,660
hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> now see CSO or CTO here's the report</font>

729
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay cool I'll see a chart with some</font>

730
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:33,790
highs and lows whatever fix the highest

731
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:35,440
that's not how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that should work and</font>

732
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:37,240
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these vulnerabilities are</font>

733
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,940
out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> tues because you know some</font>

734
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">people just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accept that always push it</font>

735
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:44,620
make it I opening I mean don't take down

736
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:46,419
their system but make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I opening make</font>

737
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:49,389
them say hey that's what these guys can

738
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:52,330
do imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the guys in Russia or</font>

739
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:54,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">China that have that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are funded it can</font>

740
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,960
do right

741
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:02,350
again back to burp seat bro<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to</font>

742
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:05,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">use this for manual like manual testing</font>

743
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:08,379
so it's a proxy app where everything I

744
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:10,629
request in the browser is stored in this

745
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:14,289
application so i can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at everything</font>

746
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:15,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that i sent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and all the responses so</font>

747
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:18,220
there's a cool tool that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

748
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,289
automated scanners have to spider the

749
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:23,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">spidering option so you load the</font>

750
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:25,029
application and anything that's linked

751
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:27,159
within the code it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go and</font>

752
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:28,539
spider that and start cashing it so that

753
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,919
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to take the time to try</font>

754
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:32,529
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure you click on every</font>

755
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,960
possible link or resource within the

756
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:37,269
application when you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing this</font>

757
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,799
to with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> spidering make sure you're</font>

758
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:42,010
paying attention to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scope so let's</font>

759
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">say example.com is your is the web</font>

760
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:45,519
application you're testing well

761
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:47,289
example.com may have a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other</font>

762
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,320
stuff on there like built into like

763
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:52,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">Facebook Connect or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google and Twitter</font>

764
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,779
things like that Akamai may be on there

765
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:57,880
whatever make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure your scope</font>

766
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:59,139
is still your scope that it didn't add

767
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,240
these things when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it started crawling</font>

768
00:30:59,139 --> 00:31:03,490
and now when it starts running the tests

769
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">and throwing fuzzing parameters and</font>

770
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,610
stuff like that at it that it's not

771
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:09,279
hitting something that's outside of

772
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:10,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">scope so always pay attention to that's</font>

773
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,549
why it's nice to have those proxies and

774
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:17,049
even your life headers and things like

775
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:18,940
that yep a few things you want to look

776
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:20,620
at review<font color="#CCCCCC"> the response that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

777
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:23,409
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of times it will tell you</font>

778
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:25,658
what's running so is it running iis or

779
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:26,919
patchy and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times even though it</font>

780
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:28,990
will go even further and tell you the

781
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,549
version that it's running so then you

782
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:32,950
can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and check and see are there any</font>

783
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:35,918
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know exploits in the wild that i can</font>

784
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:37,510
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and try and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leverage this this</font>

785
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,789
vulnerability maybe get shell or

786
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:42,220
something so bash bug is it you know is

787
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:44,769
it verbal to shell shock you can find

788
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:47,289
those things out simply use a lot of

789
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:50,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">times by finding out what's running on</font>

790
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:53,019
the server parameter fuzzing you know

791
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,029
its input sanitization on there is it

792
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:57,610
validating any input of foreign

793
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:59,740
characters how does the application

794
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:02,620
respond to that if you can generate a

795
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,570
sequel air then they will not be

796
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,178
vulnerable<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sequel injection because</font>

797
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:08,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">I put a tick in you're wanting</font>

798
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:09,600
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever so make sure that you're</font>

799
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:14,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at that that's what's nice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

800
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:16,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">this as well parameters can be found in</font>

801
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:18,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">the URL as well so don't just look at</font>

802
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:21,209
the tool look at the URL what's it doing

803
00:32:18,629 --> 00:32:22,730
try to understand the applications

804
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,710
functionality and how it's communicating

805
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:28,019
yep so you know it's Tim mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

806
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:31,769
let's say there's a zip code input on a

807
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:34,139
form and it's expecting a zip code well

808
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:35,809
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put you know alphanumeric can</font>

809
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:38,039
you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> special characters in there</font>

810
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:40,080
something that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not expecting so you</font>

811
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:42,509
want to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give these these</font>

812
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,970
input fields things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

813
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:46,860
aren't expecting just to see how you can

814
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:50,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">get it to act differently than what it's</font>

815
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:54,059
supposed to and then again kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

816
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:55,860
adding to if they are put there passing

817
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:58,980
sensitive information like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> user name</font>

818
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:00,899
or password through a get request that's

819
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,789
a vulnerability anything that's

820
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:05,699
sensitive like that is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sent over a</font>

821
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:07,259
post request again because if it's if

822
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,749
it's sent through a get request and it's

823
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:11,340
cached on the machine and someone goes

824
00:33:09,749 --> 00:33:13,499
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> does forensics or their machines</font>

825
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:15,980
compromised then all<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to do is go</font>

826
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:19,379
look and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay example.com</font>

827
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:21,749
ford / you know username equals and then

828
00:33:19,379 --> 00:33:24,209
password equals and so you've given us

829
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:25,769
the credentials right there so check and

830
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,019
see how they're actually passing these

831
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:30,509
sensitive<font color="#CCCCCC"> this sensitive information do</font>

832
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:32,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">they have you know file submissions on</font>

833
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:34,769
the application as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so how are those</font>

834
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,629
being past what kind of file types can

835
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:38,970
you upload to that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do remote</font>

836
00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:41,399
file inclusion can you upload a PHP

837
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:44,399
script on there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sanitizing is a</font>

838
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:46,860
specific so test for that see if you can

839
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:51,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">upload a malicious malicious script of</font>

840
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:55,168
payload<font color="#CCCCCC"> there burp suite has several</font>

841
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:58,259
list also for enumeration so in addition

842
00:33:55,169 --> 00:34:00,299
to the built-in functions and lists on a

843
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:02,240
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these automated tools there were</font>

844
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:04,408
several resources out there for

845
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,330
downloading and making your own or

846
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:08,099
adding to it so again<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't limit</font>

847
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:10,649
yourself to the out-of-the-box mentality

848
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:14,250
and again like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh awesome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font>

849
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:16,109
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge list of all these these</font>

850
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,239
strings that you can pass to test for

851
00:34:16,109 --> 00:34:19,379
cross-site scripting so you know go

852
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,328
download that list

853
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:22,949
and run it through against a parameter

854
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:25,139
through burp suite or something else

855
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:30,989
that allows you to throw a custom

856
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:34,019
dictionary edit so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to</font>

857
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:36,808
the next slide we can see so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

858
00:34:34,018 --> 00:34:40,859
just a screenshot of burp suite and you

859
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:44,009
can see when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you send something to the</font>

860
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:46,739
intruder function it will automatically

861
00:34:44,009 --> 00:34:48,359
pick up on each parameter so if you want

862
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:50,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at all the parameters at once I</font>

863
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:51,750
personally don't recommend doing them

864
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:54,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">all at once I kind of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to focus on</font>

865
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:56,460
on one at a time and so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> specify</font>

866
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:58,710
what parameter you want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at and</font>

867
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,480
then on another screen that's where you

868
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,460
load your your list so if you are

869
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,099
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for sequel injection or again</font>

870
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,980
cross-site scripting or trying to

871
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:09,750
discover file types or something that's

872
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,089
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of what the screen looks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

873
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:14,009
to specify those so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing</font>

874
00:35:12,089 --> 00:35:15,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">this as well make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you know</font>

875
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:17,789
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at these parameters so if</font>

876
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,380
you just automatically<font color="#CCCCCC"> do use intruder</font>

877
00:35:17,789 --> 00:35:21,059
or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and burp and you</font>

878
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,390
plug it in there it may just<font color="#E5E5E5"> find these</font>

879
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:25,859
the equal and then it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

880
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:27,690
attacking that so make sure that you

881
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:29,130
modify this to attack just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

882
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:31,769
parameters you want so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

883
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:34,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">want the session cookie to be fussed</font>

884
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:35,970
because you're authenticated right so

885
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:40,079
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at that</font>

886
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:41,848
and if you're against if you're new to

887
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,180
all of this and this sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

888
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:48,150
foreign this sounds kind of generic but

889
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,710
make sure you google on how to use burp

890
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:52,890
suite and things like that there are so

891
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:55,049
many free videos and tutorials and

892
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,759
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can download that will</font>

893
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:58,890
walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> you through and teach you exactly</font>

894
00:35:56,759 --> 00:36:03,569
how to do everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've</font>

895
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:05,819
mentioned already so an emmanuel scanner

896
00:36:03,569 --> 00:36:08,670
that I like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use from time to time is</font>

897
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:12,299
Zeno ticks by<font color="#E5E5E5"> owasp I think it's only</font>

898
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:13,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">available for Windows platform but it</font>

899
00:36:12,299 --> 00:36:16,240
will emulate three different browser

900
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:19,900
types at once and it will go through

901
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:22,209
and look at specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> parameters or every</font>

902
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,400
single parameter and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll fuzz and it</font>

903
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:27,400
will actually play it in real time<font color="#E5E5E5"> as if</font>

904
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's actual human doing it and that way</font>

905
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,440
you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real then actual pop up or</font>

906
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:34,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever it's sending instead of having</font>

907
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:38,620
to just look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it through code so it's</font>

908
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:41,770
it's pretty it's pretty useful save the

909
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:43,270
posts and get<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests sequel map if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

910
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:44,950
guys have<font color="#E5E5E5"> never used that it's a great</font>

911
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,570
tool for sequel injection so you're

912
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,669
putting those requesting to it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

913
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,990
kind of plug it in and again it finds

914
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:55,390
those parameters and a little start

915
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:57,040
attacking a sensitive information being

916
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:59,770
passed you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know he mentioned earlier is</font>

917
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,410
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> being passed through is it good or is</font>

918
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:04,570
it a post request the<font color="#E5E5E5"> password</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

919
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:06,129
session<font color="#E5E5E5"> ID user name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is cedrus so if</font>

920
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:08,440
somebody's sniffing on the network maybe

921
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:09,580
also maybe it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> running on port 80 so</font>

922
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,500
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't have a certificate</font>

923
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">authority on there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not SSL and</font>

924
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,230
you're able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just sniff those</font>

925
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:17,230
credentials as people are logging on to

926
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:19,350
it so keep that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind look for</font>

927
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:22,420
valuable comments in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the source code</font>

928
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:23,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">oftentimes if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you view source you just</font>

929
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,270
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the source code on there you'll</font>

930
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,220
see some comments made by developers

931
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:29,920
about the functionality of the

932
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:32,049
application but you also might find some

933
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,880
nice source code in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there too that will</font>

934
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,470
help you understand more about how the

935
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,480
application functions and passes

936
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:39,899
information yeah there's there's

937
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:42,370
actually several times where have

938
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,630
developer comments you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

939
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:45,880
of talking back and forth to each other

940
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:47,800
just to remind themselves this does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

941
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,170
and then it will do this but not if you

942
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:53,200
know and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've found again we</font>

943
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:55,800
found credentials we found admin

944
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:59,290
credentials and we've also found that

945
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:01,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">database username internal IP addresses</font>

946
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:04,900
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that have helped us Taylor</font>

947
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:07,540
air attacks so and now to kind of

948
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:14,220
prevent death by PowerPoint give you

949
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:14,220
this guy's is cute<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

950
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay a little bit more about manual</font>

951
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:24,640
testing some things you want to look at

952
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:26,049
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is when</font>

953
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,529
you're looking at these applications

954
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:31,720
look at it as an unauthenticated user

955
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:35,110
what can you see now look at it as an

956
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:37,750
authenticated user so during the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kickoff</font>

957
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:39,760
call you want to ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you're</font>

958
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:41,770
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me credentials I want</font>

959
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,110
admin level credentials and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

960
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:46,360
you know standard user credentials and

961
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,890
the reason you do that is so that you

962
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">can look at this application again is</font>

963
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:53,020
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an unauthenticated user see are</font>

964
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:54,940
there links in the source<font color="#CCCCCC"> code that</font>

965
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,950
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> hiding visually through</font>

966
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:59,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript but if I look in the source</font>

967
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:00,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">code I can still see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the admin links you</font>

968
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,870
know is that stuff in there and can i

969
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:07,750
access it as an unauthenticated user as

970
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:10,150
a non admin user am<font color="#CCCCCC"> I able to get to</font>

971
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:13,150
those admin level functions so these are

972
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:15,340
you know sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of basic privilege</font>

973
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,630
escalation things to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> but just</font>

974
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:19,570
keep in mind that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to look at</font>

975
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:21,820
this application from any any different

976
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:24,310
level of authentication or unauthentic a

977
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:25,930
shin that you can what's good about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

978
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:28,120
too is that if you have in a min account

979
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:29,919
or just any<font color="#E5E5E5"> you account really can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

980
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:32,049
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that account again can you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open up</font>

981
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,820
in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> vm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then pop it in another</font>

982
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:36,880
browser or<font color="#E5E5E5"> z no ticks or something like</font>

983
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:39,640
that and don't use the same session over

984
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,490
and over again so especially admins you

985
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,870
know get the admin password someone else

986
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:45,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">is on there doing what they're supposed</font>

987
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:49,359
to be doing but you log on as well so

988
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:50,950
now you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the same its handling</font>

989
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">multiple sessions for not saying users</font>

990
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:56,109
so that's something you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to test for</font>

991
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:59,560
as well in the password reuse if you did

992
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:01,510
find an old password can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use that</font>

993
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">same password again can you change it</font>

994
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:07,170
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old password how are they</font>

995
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:11,080
handling authentication user credentials

996
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:13,300
password expiration and such yeah so why

997
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,430
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a big deal if you can if the same</font>

998
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,440
user can log on at different locations

999
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:19,299
at the same time or you kind of have to

1000
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,480
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from use case so if this is a</font>

1001
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:24,820
bank and your login and someone else

1002
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,530
logs in and it kills your session then

1003
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,760
you know something's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay why did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1004
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:30,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">just get logged out of my account</font>

1005
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,840
something's going on here<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if they</font>

1006
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,759
don't terminate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> session and they</font>

1007
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:36,520
allow multiple sessions that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an</font>

1008
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,050
issue let's say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone does have</font>

1009
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,690
your credentials and they're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1010
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,800
your account<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same time you are</font>

1011
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:44,440
that's that's something that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1012
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,360
report log off features as well it does

1013
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,490
it automatically log you off after so

1014
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,840
much inactivity or does it just stay

1015
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:52,149
there are you on there you forget to log

1016
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,950
off and oh my gosh you walk away from

1017
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:55,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">your system and someone now has access</font>

1018
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:57,819
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your account on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your system you don't</font>

1019
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:59,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">lock your system perhaps so these are</font>

1020
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:01,590
things also especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you still a</font>

1021
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,760
session cookie so you get

1022
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:05,500
document.cookie to pop up let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1023
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,670
the cross-site scripting and then you

1024
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,960
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know hey this is a</font>

1025
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:10,360
legitimate session cookie and then

1026
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,890
you've used that again my<font color="#CCCCCC"> brent said it</font>

1027
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,660
doesn't knock them off and now you're

1028
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:16,029
kind of piggybacking on that session

1029
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:18,490
yeah there's actually been several

1030
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:20,620
assessments where I've sniffed traffic

1031
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:22,419
and had been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to get the session</font>

1032
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:25,480
cookies and you know see what site they

1033
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:27,850
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at one of them when I can't</font>

1034
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,890
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> the name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I was able to actually</font>

1035
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:31,960
go in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of throw in the</font>

1036
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:34,420
session cookie and had access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

1037
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,010
same account that they had and was able

1038
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:39,820
to get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty sensitive information</font>

1039
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:41,920
from that client so so don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just look</font>

1040
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:44,770
at the application as well you know

1041
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:48,370
depending on the scope maybe the host

1042
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:50,200
isn't within<font color="#CCCCCC"> the scope but if it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1043
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:52,600
least look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the services that are</font>

1044
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,700
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> version of apache is</font>

1045
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,529
running what version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my is etc are</font>

1046
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,390
they doing patch management are<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1047
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:00,430
vulnerable to summit exploit out there

1048
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:02,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can now gain an interpreter shell</font>

1049
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:04,180
or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so don't just</font>

1050
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,800
limit yourself to the application

1051
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:08,500
whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're looking at these look at</font>

1052
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,610
the host as well you know also<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

1053
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're doing the crawling and the</font>

1054
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:14,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">spidering is there an admin portal it's</font>

1055
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:17,320
not available<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a publicly facing you</font>

1056
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:19,899
know again cpanel is a good example yeah

1057
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:23,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">Apache yeah default we found default</font>

1058
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:24,880
creds on tomcat several times and we are

1059
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,950
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to go and deploy a</font>

1060
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,290
malicious like the laudanum script the

1061
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:32,700
war files and get shell on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the host just</font>

1062
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:36,009
because they had default creds on tomcat

1063
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:37,359
same with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> with cpanel can you brute</font>

1064
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:37,829
force that with the username that you

1065
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,869
found

1066
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:43,650
or you know known a known list like

1067
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:45,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">rocky you txt a good password list so</font>

1068
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:47,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">just you know just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think kind of think</font>

1069
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,589
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box like the guy Tim said</font>

1070
00:42:47,549 --> 00:42:51,809
don't just look at the application but

1071
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:53,190
look at the host as well because that

1072
00:42:51,809 --> 00:42:58,680
will a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can leverage</font>

1073
00:42:53,190 --> 00:43:01,249
that so again we're kind of starting to

1074
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:04,979
repeat herself a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit here but</font>

1075
00:43:01,249 --> 00:43:06,709
look for dangerous HTTP methods there

1076
00:43:04,979 --> 00:43:09,149
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been quite a few times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

1077
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:12,538
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> application was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

1078
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:16,019
up that they had put and delete enabled

1079
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:17,910
so we put our own script up there and it

1080
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:20,488
actually ran and so we as shell or we

1081
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:23,848
could we could browse directories on the

1082
00:43:20,489 --> 00:43:25,440
host and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so look at</font>

1083
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:27,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">those things make sure you document it</font>

1084
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,829
obviously let the client know if you're

1085
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:32,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">not familiar with like some of these</font>

1086
00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:35,190
HTTP methods in map there there's a NSE

1087
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:37,049
script on there for for testing these so

1088
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:38,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can see if it's got debug or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pull it</font>

1089
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:44,999
or anything like that in a man yeah it's

1090
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:47,880
pretty quick again we talked about

1091
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:50,578
earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the ssl/tls settings do</font>

1092
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:54,059
they still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have TLS one point or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL</font>

1093
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:57,329
three are they and do they have super

1094
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:58,979
like really weak ciphers enabled what's

1095
00:43:57,329 --> 00:44:01,229
their signing you know is it weak

1096
00:43:58,979 --> 00:44:03,538
signing so you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at all these</font>

1097
00:44:01,229 --> 00:44:08,149
things again all the all these tools are

1098
00:44:03,539 --> 00:44:12,420
built into cali to like test<font color="#E5E5E5"> ssl and</font>

1099
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:14,369
what's the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> ssl</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL check yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL</font>

1100
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,630
checkup am so there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are quite a</font>

1101
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:18,509
few that are on there as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I know</font>

1102
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:20,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">qualis has a website that you can throw</font>

1103
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:22,680
on there but be careful about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1104
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:24,390
because the client might not be happy

1105
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,848
about you running their website through

1106
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:30,019
this so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just check with them if you're</font>

1107
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:32,789
going to use a public tool like that

1108
00:44:30,019 --> 00:44:34,468
again look for file uploading features

1109
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:36,660
you know brim mentioned before where we

1110
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:39,599
were able to upload a malicious files

1111
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:42,089
PHP batch<font color="#CCCCCC"> Perl scripts or something like</font>

1112
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:45,209
that so a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1113
00:44:42,089 --> 00:44:46,890
about this oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> really can you you can do</font>

1114
00:44:45,209 --> 00:44:48,910
that well yeah you have an upload

1115
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:51,490
function on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your website so</font>

1116
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:53,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">i upload stuff yeah so let's say let's</font>

1117
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:55,060
say that the website<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can edit a</font>

1118
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:57,250
profile<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can add a profile</font>

1119
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:59,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture so obviously you have to upload</font>

1120
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:03,070
your profile<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture well if it says</font>

1121
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:05,200
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> jpg or something are they actually</font>

1122
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:06,910
sticking to that are they sanitizing

1123
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,359
that because there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been so many</font>

1124
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:13,899
times where we do let's say if it's PDF

1125
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:17,320
upload so we'll do<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be shell</font>

1126
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:19,840
dot PHP dot PDF and so all they're

1127
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:22,030
looking at at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end is got PDF but the</font>

1128
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:24,400
server ignores that so it actually runs

1129
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:26,110
the script and again that's another

1130
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,050
shell on that host because they weren't

1131
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:32,380
sanitizing that file upload so you know

1132
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:34,330
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to also</font>

1133
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:37,840
brim mentioned you know changing it from

1134
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:40,120
PHP<font color="#E5E5E5"> PDF so if you are doing let's say on</font>

1135
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:43,120
external assessment or black box assess

1136
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:44,589
where scenario-based whatever you know

1137
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:48,210
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure using measures to</font>

1138
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:50,860
evade the firewalls antivirus<font color="#CCCCCC"> ids IPS</font>

1139
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:53,140
you know any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of detection of</font>

1140
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:55,330
prevention mechanisms they may have in

1141
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:57,190
place and to do that you know one ways

1142
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:59,680
to change the file name for the file

1143
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:02,710
type another way any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of box keishon</font>

1144
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,540
polymorphic code file extension changing

1145
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:07,990
you can wrap you know malicious files

1146
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:10,720
and name it a PDF stuff like that so if

1147
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:13,270
you guys also are on the defensive side

1148
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:17,049
if you see a PDF in their net<font color="#CCCCCC"> pdfs like</font>

1149
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:20,110
one page and it's several Meg's why

1150
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:22,450
that's weird so make sure you know why

1151
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:24,820
is that that small file small<font color="#CCCCCC"> file so</font>

1152
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:27,600
big so that's a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of detect</font>

1153
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,600
that to go

1154
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:34,369
and again as we mentioned before

1155
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:38,329
methodologies especially if you're new

1156
00:46:34,369 --> 00:46:40,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">to this look at it see what all the best</font>

1157
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:43,880
practices<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you know for testing all</font>

1158
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:47,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">the areas to look at it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great way to</font>

1159
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:49,220
stay on<font color="#E5E5E5"> track don't ever use a tool that</font>

1160
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:50,390
you've never used before try something

1161
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:52,578
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tried before on a</font>

1162
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:54,200
client site especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if its production</font>

1163
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:56,900
server because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not exactly</font>

1164
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:59,480
sure what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and you break something</font>

1165
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:00,800
and they come you know call you<font color="#CCCCCC"> or panic</font>

1166
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,560
or come running into the room if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

1167
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,540
on site say oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> building's on</font>

1168
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:08,839
fire what did you do and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say</font>

1169
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:11,300
well I don't know that's never a good

1170
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:13,220
thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows it's got it twisted yeah</font>

1171
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:16,550
just something i just<font color="#E5E5E5"> downloaded from</font>

1172
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,899
anonymous they said it was cool so you

1173
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:20,030
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> always to always check it out make</font>

1174
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:23,420
sure that you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> your tool is</font>

1175
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:26,390
doing tests it in a lab don't test<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font>

1176
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:29,930
a client<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment and then when you</font>

1177
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:33,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">are all ready to go and then to go hack</font>

1178
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:36,410
some websites so also<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to add to</font>

1179
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:38,750
this the practice in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lab is like</font>

1180
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:40,250
that some people that aren't pen testers

1181
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:41,450
perhaps you have a lab at home and

1182
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:43,400
you're testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing your</font>

1183
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:46,069
own thing and you start downloading some

1184
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:49,160
stuff from some torrents and their crack

1185
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:51,710
software<font color="#CCCCCC"> cracked versions of cabbage or</font>

1186
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:53,149
a kinetics or something you start

1187
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:54,619
running that on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your system keep in mind</font>

1188
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:57,160
that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these crack versions of</font>

1189
00:47:54,619 --> 00:47:59,750
this applications also may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have built</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1190
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,160
X points in it too and so you may be

1191
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:03,079
thinking oh sweet i'm getting all these

1192
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:06,259
awesome hacker tools well you're now

1193
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:08,230
also infecting your own system so be

1194
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:11,480
very careful about using kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

1195
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:13,119
pirated solder their software you know

1196
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,890
something about Kali what's great about

1197
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,240
offensive security as if they have you

1198
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:18,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they put these tools in here and</font>

1199
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,140
it's they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty safe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use as far</font>

1200
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:23,000
as knowing that there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rat built</font>

1201
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:26,549
into it or something

1202
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,990
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we have a few minutes left we</font>

1203
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:30,390
want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure there's time for any</font>

1204
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:31,799
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you all might have if</font>

1205
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:35,339
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not comfortable asking us then</font>

1206
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,960

1210
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:47,310
Shin hacks with four decks because it's

1211
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:49,130
late any questions yeah you guys there's

1212
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:52,470
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of schools full several for</font>

1213
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:56,700
obviously by that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in testing some for</font>

1214
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:59,730
commercial some of the source do you

1215
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:04,100
have some that are free

1216
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:04,100
we can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> before let's go that next step</font>

1217
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:09,569
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely antsy in Kali</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Burt you</font>

1218
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:11,368
know burb has the commercial version

1219
00:49:09,569 --> 00:49:12,960
like a free version in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the commercial</font>

1220
00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:15,390
version so you can use the commercial

1221
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,930
version but<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh wasp you know he</font>

1222
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:20,940
mentioned a xeno tix but a while sap is

1223
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:24,180
free it's good it's got a lot of

1224
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:26,670
features to it so and yeah there is a

1225
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:27,990
free version of burp suite it<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

1226
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:30,720
it's limited and some of the things you

1227
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:32,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do but you can get the job</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done and</font>

1228
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,490
there's other tools to like different

1229
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:37,559
kind of confusions that will do what the

1230
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:39,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">commercial side does but it's it's it's</font>

1231
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:44,180
in cols yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I did just a</font>

1232
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:44,180
little more tedious to not as convenient

1233
00:49:55,279 --> 00:50:01,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so as far as like on the server</font>

1234
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:05,029
level I what I know is that in the

1235
00:50:01,819 --> 00:50:07,609
script it will look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for just that file</font>

1236
00:50:05,029 --> 00:50:10,219
extension like in life say a<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript</font>

1237
00:50:07,609 --> 00:50:11,749
or something and so then it passes that

1238
00:50:10,219 --> 00:50:14,779
and will<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually let it upload to the</font>

1239
00:50:11,749 --> 00:50:17,178
server level when it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that server level</font>

1240
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:19,909
a lot of times the server will read the

1241
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:22,009
file name and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the first like the</font>

1242
00:50:19,909 --> 00:50:24,259
first extension and it will still allow

1243
00:50:22,009 --> 00:50:25,880
it to execute so does that answer your

1244
00:50:24,259 --> 00:50:27,739
question also when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're using</font>

1245
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,819
polymorphic code or you're changing so

1246
00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:32,179
if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that it's not</font>

1247
00:50:28,819 --> 00:50:33,739
actually changing the previous file the

1248
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:34,999
core file right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want it to</font>

1249
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:37,219
change the algorithms or anything like

1250
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:39,348
that on on there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of it's</font>

1251
00:50:37,219 --> 00:50:41,179
a mask<font color="#E5E5E5"> so even with the file types</font>

1252
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:44,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">oftentimes you're able to evade it</font>

1253
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:45,799
because it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mask you're on a Mac</font>

1254
00:50:44,269 --> 00:50:48,308
for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you change the file</font>

1255
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:50,959
type<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll change the file type right so</font>

1256
00:50:48,309 --> 00:50:53,059
but some of this it'll it'll remain the

1257
00:50:50,959 --> 00:50:54,979
same as whatever that that root file

1258
00:50:53,059 --> 00:50:57,650
type is yeah kind of like converting it

1259
00:50:54,979 --> 00:50:59,928
from plain text<font color="#CCCCCC"> so like base64</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encoding</font>

1260
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:03,099
or something like that so still there

1261
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:06,099
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just in a different broken up what</font>

1262
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:06,099
so

1263
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:16,970
is so how do you how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find where</font>

1264
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:18,440
the file ended up going so when you do

1265
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:21,379
the upload you want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1266
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:24,619
all all that stuff is<font color="#E5E5E5"> running through a</font>

1267
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:27,559
proxy and so you can actually go and see

1268
00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:30,109
where it sent it to and follow that link

1269

can't upload it you don't have

1271
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:37,309
permissions to view it sometimes you do

1272
00:51:34,339 --> 00:51:38,960
but if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the response and</font>

1276
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,470
