57
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:55,799
Johnny's no tech hacking talk or read

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,860
made it beyond virtual qualifiers this

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,900
is what's known as public shaming so

62
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,560
we're hoping this year that they do

63
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,260
better one of my students<font color="#E5E5E5"> one captured a</font>

64
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,540
flag and a black badge secure WV this

65
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,070
year so I'm very<font color="#E5E5E5"> proud of him so the</font>

66
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,720
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I did was have him go back</font>

67
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:23,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">and tell the rest of the team how he did</font>

68
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:26,070
it I'm volunteer for hackers for charity

69
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,339
we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hackers for charity student</font>

70

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,320
the idea of service and service learning

they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> having a mario kart termina</font>

81
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,329
coming up next week where everyone's

82
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:04,530

over to Johnny they also there's a

84
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,790
membership fee five bucks a person so

85
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,690
every every semester they collect money

86
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:14,220
and send it to Johnny today is the 45th

87
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,519
anniversary of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Marshall University plane</font>

88
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,200
crash it was hard for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to fly</font>

89
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,469
yesterday for that reason which sounds

90
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:26,039
weird do one scene we are marshall it's

91
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:29,400
the worst sporting<font color="#CCCCCC"> of disaster in</font>

92
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,870
history but today is actually today we

93
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,330
turn off the fountain that Marshall

94
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,550
University so I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> co</font>

95
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">aside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would cited with this but this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

96
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,669
a very emotional time

97
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:43,289
if you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Leo Marshall it's a</font>

98
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:45,299
great movie I'm the host of reboot it is

99
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:46,378
the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> listen to reboot it that's</font>

100
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,659
why I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's like five</font>

101
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:52,469
people listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it anyway reboot at</font>

102
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:54,688
podcast.com it's also on<font color="#CCCCCC"> itunes last</font>

103
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:56,849
couple weeks we've talked in all threat

104
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:58,770
last week we talked about red teaming

105
00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:00,409
what's red teaming what's penetration

106
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,669
testing wants the vulnerability scan

107
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:04,438
people in our industry tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw</font>

108
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:08,520
those together and confuse them I think

109
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:11,639
we tried at least to define them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

110
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,568
really bad knees so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I start wavering</font>

111
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:19,379
up here it's not that I'm drunk not yet

112
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:20,639
but I my knees<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurt all the time so if</font>

113
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:22,889
you have to follow me up or down the

114
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,210
stairs I'm sorry so we're starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

115
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:29,669
I guess I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder too much right</font>

116
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,919
this is the security pin pyramid it

117
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:34,650
actually appears in the first book<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

118
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">first thing you need to do to build a</font>

119
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,688
mature security program is start with

120
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,300
policies and procedures the second would

121
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:43,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">be user training patch management and</font>

122
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,409
all on up i'm not going to read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

123
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:48,330
you but people are buying way too many

124
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:51,180
blinky light boxes putting it in their

125
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:54,779
environment in wanting it to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> magic</font>

126
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:59,069
for them there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of companies that</font>

127
00:05:54,779 --> 00:06:00,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">will sell you cyber apt protector but do</font>

128
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:03,839
you really know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that box is doing</font>

129
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:05,669
if you're if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the top of</font>

130
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,310
the pyramid without doing the things at

131
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:10,948
the bottom pyramid you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really doing</font>

132
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,249
yourself a disfavored when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this a</font>

133
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:17,909
lot and<font color="#E5E5E5"> small and medium-sized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> companies</font>

134
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:19,800
so what's a penetration test I think the

135
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:22,860
penetration testing execution standard

136
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:27,270
is really the best definition and if you

137
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,770
get check that out Dave Kennedy Chris

138
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nickerson some other people got together</font>

139
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,628
a few years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago but together a really</font>

140
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:35,998
nice website as well as defining the

141
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:37,560
terms they have the execution should

142
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:42,419
standard which talks about the tools

143
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:44,540
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need in order to do proper</font>

144
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:47,669
testing

145
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,890
so a pre-engagement the first thing you

146
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:51,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in someplace usually</font>

147
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,640
they think I'm there to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get everyone</font>

148
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,650
fired which is always fun because I

149
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,550
usually see clients after<font color="#E5E5E5"> a breach and I</font>

150
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:02,250
to this day say that nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> cares about</font>

151
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:04,350
security until they get breached so we

152
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">usually go in and say you know what do</font>

153
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,530
you want do you want a vulnerability

154
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,480
scan do you want a pin test and you have

155
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:12,840
to explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> client the difference</font>

156
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,240
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two scoping like Kevin</font>

157
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,940
Johnson said earlier in this keynote

158
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,220
that scoping document is very important

159
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:24,360
and you should never go beyond that

160
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,710
scoping document technically if you do

161
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,690
you're breaking the law<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

162
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:30,479
get-out-of-jail-free call the card only

163
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:34,230
applies the things that you agree to in

164
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,720
that first meeting scheduling I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

165
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,130
I'm pick and choose what I do which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

166
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,660
pretty cool but if you work at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a large</font>

167
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:43,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization you probably have people</font>

168
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:45,060
selling penetration test way way with

169
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:51,090
way way too much too little time to

170
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:54,650
actually do a proper job so that can be

171
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:57,330
an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> also pricing smaller</font>

172
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,849
organizations have different needs so

173
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:02,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">you tend to the price that differently</font>

174
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:06,979
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been going through a flat fee model</font>

175
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,979
for my smaller and mid-sized clients

176
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:13,620
then doing it hourly then there's

177
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:18,720
different kinds of penetration test

178
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:20,550
define I once had a contract<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

179
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,780
wireless penetration test which was

180
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,130
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the easiest thing I've ever done</font>

181
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:29,000
because I should up need it and have a

182
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:29,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">wireless network so whenever you have</font>

183
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:36,360
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> making the decisions that aren't</font>

184
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:39,390
technical be careful one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

185
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,010
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the thing in I didn't say</font>

186
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,838
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is my friend Dave Kennedy you came</font>

187
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,569
up and I'm sorry I'm name-dropping I

188
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,040
just want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give credit where credit</font>

189
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:52,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">and get hell on facebook for it's all</font>

190
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:54,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">over with your job as a network defender</font>

191
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,370
and this is a sort of a network defender

192
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,790
talk more as an offensive talk we'll

193
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,640
talk

194
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:02,819
blending those together later on used to

195
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:08,280
protect what makes your organization

00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:03,540
the drawings for all these products if

214
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:05,609
you're doing a you know drug interaction

215
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,560
defense somebody dies because they took

216
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">a specific kind of drug you're going to</font>

217
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,030
have all this information<font color="#E5E5E5"> setting in</font>

218
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,710
your network and the first part<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font>

219
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,430
to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> convince people that yes</font>

220
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,450
somebody wants it and usually that

221
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:20,099
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say the Chinese</font>

222
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,900
do everything but they love intellectual

223
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,160
property so they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the</font>

224
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,590
weakest link through and look at your

225
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,410
business associates your business

226
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:31,890
associates and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to target</font>

227
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:36,540
those people so whenever you're doing

228
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:38,310
testing make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your client who</font>

229
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,839
engages you to do that testing

230
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,969
understands what they're getting

231
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,260
themselves into and then try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

232
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">out if you know what you're getting</font>

233
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,360
yourself into anyone here work at a

234
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:51,150
small and medium-sized company<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay a</font>

235
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,860
couple who works at fortune thought

236
00:10:51,150 --> 00:11:00,240
fortune teens okay well fortune<font color="#E5E5E5"> 500</font>

fortune 1000 s<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay kudos penetration</font>

238
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:08,559
testing who buys penetration test

239
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:12,939
so we need to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to each other about</font>

240
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:16,379
what a penetration test is who thinks

241
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:18,910
the penetration test is injustice scan

242
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:21,670
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinks the penetration test isn't in</font>

243
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,410
maps can<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well you're pretty either</font>

244
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:28,719
you're lying to me or you're pretty

245
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:31,360
educated about this one of the things in

246
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,279
scoping you have to deal with is a lot

247
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,389
of small medium-sized companies don't

248
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,800
know what's on their network and so when

249
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:40,569
you show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they don't know what's</font>

250
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,729
on their network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to step back</font>

251
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:44,439
and say well we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not having a</font>

252
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,850
penetration test the first thing we're

253
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:48,399
going to do is figure out what's on your

254
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,899
network and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this sort of goes into what</font>

255
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,670
I'm going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming up which</font>

256
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:54,790
is purple team who's heard of the idea

257
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:57,579
purple team so purple team is Red Team

258
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,199
Blue team working together so if i show

259
00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:01,748
up the pone your network and your

260
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:04,300
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't even know what your</font>

261
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:10,029
network is for scoping how much most

262
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:11,769
opponent the other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

263
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:14,079
want to throw people to the Lions if

264
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:15,999
they're not ready to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fight in the</font>

265
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,609
gliding at our cage and most people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

266
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:20,639
the reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people buy things like</font>

267
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,350
penetration tests at this point are

268
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:27,339
there either dealing with some sort of

269
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:30,670
industry regulation or they bought

270
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:32,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">cybersecurity and the insurance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> company</font>

271
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:36,429
says we need you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show us that you're</font>

272
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,170
secure I can make a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of documents</font>

273
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:40,629
writing email saying yes you're secure

274
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,339
the problem is is that most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

275
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:44,589
companies who are engaging<font color="#E5E5E5"> for these</font>

276
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:47,170
sorts of activities never have done the

277
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:48,610
basics back to the security pyramid

278
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:54,279
they've never built policies and

279
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:56,829
procedures they are not patching so

280
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:59,019
definition of what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing and when</font>

281
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:01,329
you're doing it is very important to

282
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:03,790
identify your technical contact whenever

283
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:06,819
you break their network you know who to

284
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:10,480
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say I'm sorry I didn't mean to</font>

285
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:12,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">break your network because things do go</font>

286
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">along the other thing that you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

287
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">define is when can you do testing most</font>

288
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,370
people only want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> night</font>

289

essay planned for things going<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font>

293
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:36,349
because they will go wrong so what's

294
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,650
some of the tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use for small</font>

295
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,600
medium-sized networks we just start with

296
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">a harvester it's amazing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the</font>

297
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,710
website<font color="#E5E5E5"> and find a lot of things lawyers</font>

298
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,060
love to tell their life story on the

00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:53,029
website where<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were born a lot</font>

304
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,250
main target you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> always get their</font>

305
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:08,689
trusted person which is their secretary

306
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,190
you know harvester is a great tool but a

307
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,350
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times you don't have to go that</font>

308
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:16,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">far</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to gather information about</font>

309
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:20,120
an organization there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some really</font>

310
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:23,510
big challenges to social engineering in

311
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:26,170
a smaller organization you know inmate

312
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:28,130
in Andy Griffith Show when all the

313
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,529
strangers showed up from out of town

314
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,880
they were there<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong well when</font>

315
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:34,880
somebody walks into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network you</font>

316
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,589
don't know who the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hell they are you're</font>

317
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,200
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a lot of questions they</font>

318
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:42,790
know who to UPS guy is come in wearing a

319
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:48,500
UPS uniform it's not going to end well

320
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:51,290
even sending email I did spearfishing

321
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,959
campaign as the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> administrator in</font>

322
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,490
an organization to summer that didn't

323
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:58,239
end well because they all knew the

324
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:00,320
system administrator knew how he wrote

325
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,779
realized that that didn't sound like

326
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,740
Matt maybe they ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give somebody a</font>

327
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:08,089
call I think smaller organizations is

328
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,430
probably one of the toughest

329
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:12,650
environments for social engineering that

330
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,930
you could find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

331
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:18,050
old USB attack you know beep leave a

332
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:19,969
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> USBs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lying around right well at</font>

333
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,849
least in<font color="#CCCCCC"> West Virginia people return</font>

334
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,850
them

335
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:28,259
oh I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found this USB it's probably</font>

336
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:30,880
something important so also<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard</font>

337
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:34,060
need to be less they need to be a lot

338
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:39,459
less polite so one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did</font>

339
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:40,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">find is that people are busy and they</font>

340
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:43,300
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of attention to things</font>

341
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:44,949
like domain name so I bought a lot of

342
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:48,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">domain names that was one letter off</font>

343
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:51,729
this summer and that worked wonderfully

344
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:55,240
because they see that domain they don't

345
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:58,180
you know look that close at it and then

346
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:02,130
they end up actually clicking on links

347
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,130
and things there's an interesting

348
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:07,329
there's an interesting tool out there

349
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,250
called URL crazy it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you with</font>

350
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:10,689
this go through the permutations that

351
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,420
might be available but you're still

352
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have to do manual work looking</font>

353
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,290
to make sure that those domains are

354
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:21,339
available and go with a cheap domain

355
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:22,810
registrar you don't want to spend a ton

356
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:24,399
of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

357
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:26,380
charge it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the client so go out</font>

358
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:32,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">and find a six-dollar domain registrar</font>

359
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:32,040
so you're not running up your expenses

360
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:36,969
so technical challenges<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work at home</font>

361
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,579
from the summer guess who my internet

362
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,740
service provider is I don't know what

363
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:43,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hell they're doing with ports but it</font>

364
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:49,209
just did not work so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to move</font>

365
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:51,160
beyond comcast somehow and the way that

366
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:54,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because we've already talked</font>

367
00:16:51,160 --> 00:17:00,279
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other things in the slide is a</font>

368
00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:03,009
VPS SSH and pedia PTF does anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

369
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:05,709
what PTF is penetration tester testing

370
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:07,990
framework so in the olden days when you

371
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:09,520
rolled a cloud box you spend all of your

372
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,409
time trying to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you're</font>

373
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,629
going to install<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit this week</font>

374
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:16,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it seems to change every time</font>

375
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:18,909
you turn around in luton hunting down

376
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:22,449
tools the penetration testing framework

377
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:24,459
which is a trusted sec Dave kennedy

378
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:27,640
toole will basically install everything

379
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:30,100
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's brother for you but let me</font>

380
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,020
forewarn you it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will break things you</font>

381
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,649
actually recompile the kernel at one

382
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:37,780
point so if you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> Armitage for example</font>

383
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:41,110
it does not work if you use the specific

384
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:43,060
tool but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great for using on a VPS</font>

385
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:46,990
because you don't need a graphic user

386
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:49,270
interface and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 40 minutes the</font>

387
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:51,100
most even on a slow connection you have

388
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:54,580
a totally up and running penetration

389
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:58,149
testing box my personal favorite is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lin</font>

390
00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:03,580
node Sunni one<font color="#CCCCCC"> Uslan node Amazon's</font>

391
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:05,530
gotten weird about using their AWS for

392
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,570
testing they also have way too many

393
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:10,780
features for me i look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> going okay</font>

394
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:13,540
now how dare<font color="#CCCCCC"> we start this machine so</font>

395
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">i've moved away from amazon the other</font>

396
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:19,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">went a social engineering tool kit very</font>

397
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,560
simple ways to fish<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and if you</font>

398
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,830
don't know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the social engineering</font>

399
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:27,129
tool kit there are tons of videos out

400
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:29,470
there about it but basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the social</font>

401
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:34,210
engineering tool kit you can do browser

402
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:39,400
attacks you can clone websites then use

403
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:42,760
that one letter off domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> name so set</font>

404
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:49,000
set to the rescue how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

405
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:51,670
still clicking on shortened links we all

406
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,950
do these still work and phishing attacks

407
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:58,390
so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a test certainly</font>

408
00:18:53,950 --> 00:19:00,670
clinks still work we have basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

409
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:02,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">have trained users to click okay yes</font>

410
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:05,560
okay yes and click<font color="#E5E5E5"> shorten links because</font>

411
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:08,560
they're busy so shortened link still

412
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,540
work I heard interesting story about

413
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone factors anyone here using phone</font>

414
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:17,980
factor so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-factor</font>

415
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:22,360
authentication so it will either call or

416
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:24,210
text you I believe if whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

417
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,070
logging into something just clicked ok

418
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:29,470
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know someone who was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

419
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:31,840
penetration test and he says he's never

420
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:34,570
had problem getting around it that

421
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,340
basically the user will see something

422
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:39,250
pop up on their phone and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just click</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

423
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:42,939
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why they were doing it and</font>

424
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:45,130
they're like it had to be something

425
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,650
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> i login</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff all day I didn't</font>

426
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,629
know maybe maybe I'm miss logging into

427
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:53,779
something

428
00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:56,889
so if you're using phone factor you may

429
00:19:53,779 --> 00:20:00,730
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in your security</font>

430
00:19:56,889 --> 00:20:00,729
information security

431
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,330
um

my friends will troll me at the

435
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:23,850
strangest times and I'm like anyway so

<font color="#CCCCCC">what we talkin about who are you people</font>

437
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:35,070
this is the worse than teaching so VPS

00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:44,950
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you come in and you're a black</font>

00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:47,770
t-shirt wearing jackass and put<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

442
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,900
things and you write a report saying you

443
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:53,440
pwned all the things and your clients

444
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:57,460
stupid we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to move beyond</font>

445
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:00,340
that and that's the reason for blue team

446
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,530
I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to purple team purple team was</font>

447
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:06,879
originally i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think was an idea of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mick</font>

Douglas no Martin Bose Bose<font color="#CCCCCC"> bostic's</font>

gives me and Eric Milam have done toxin

450
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:14,050
as well as day counting on purple team

451
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:17,320
and the idea the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I use it with</font>

452
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:20,080
my clients is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say once</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you build</font>

453
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:22,300
all the ground level<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff so once you</font>

454
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,320
write the policies a procedure once you

455
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,980
help them figure out what's on their

456
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,540
network and you're still not<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready for a</font>

457
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,350
penetration test let's see if you can

458
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:37,360
detect specific things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say i'm</font>

459
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:39,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to send exploit x did it work you</font>

460
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,370
didn't work did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> detect it if they</font>

461
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:45,370
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm still waiting for it and you've</font>

462
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:48,000
got shells they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so then</font>

463
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:53,020
you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out how to fix that</font>

464
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
you know it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just saying you have a</font>

465
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:58,270
problem you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help them move</font>

466
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,720
beyond their problem and you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

467
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:07,090
in this sort of engagement I don't sell

468
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,670
security solutions I'm not going to sell

469
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,230
somebody like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> lightbox there are</font>

470
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,150
some things if you've got active

471
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,800
directory domain issues i am not going

472

<font color="#E5E5E5">to come in its fixture active directory</font>

473
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:22,590
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you test your security</font>

474
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,590
in this kinder more gentle way

475
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:27,070
most small works or even being

476
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,520
emphasized organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

477
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:32,320
mature security programs lack of

478
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">documentation lack of policies is a</font>

479
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,990
problem and in red teaming in a small or

480
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:41,080
medium-sized organization doesn't scale

481
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:46,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">scale well at all if you have your</font>

483
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,430
organization with resources and you have

484
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:54,190
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot to protect red teaming is for you</font>

485
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:57,370
it's sort of penetration plus plus but

486
00:22:54,190 --> 00:23:02,730
generally it doesn't scale well for

487
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:02,729
medium and small businesses reporting

488
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,710
I've seen some really bad reports out

489
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:11,709
there the most important<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

490
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:14,950
do is do a good succinct overview about

491
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,960
what the problem is right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and executive</font>

492
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,570
some summary that explains the business

493
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,090
impact because your job is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

494
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:25,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">what how they need to protect what makes</font>

495
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:26,290
them money and the technical findings

496
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,580
need to be in there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font>

497

something you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw up the</font>

498
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:34,689
top it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be at the bottom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

499
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:39,160
how do you figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out someone broke in</font>

500
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:41,350
your network I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually noticed that</font>

work monitor we're using Dave Kennedy's

508
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,610
artillery and then it has reporting

509
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,680
interface so basically you put one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:11,080
these in each logical a physical part of

want to in order to watch alerts but

00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:31,630
somebody clicks on a link or opens and

attachment social engineers you this

520

thing is going to tell you hey there's

00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,418
somebody trying to

522
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:42,029
pivot inside your network it's free it's

00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:44,440
open source<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-cost and it's on github</font>

524
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:46,690
best place to find if you look into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

525
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,869
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun to build they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did things</font>

526
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:52,360
like add an LED screen so it tells you

00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:53,559
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP dresses because you plug the</font>

528

same thing your network start scanning

529
00:24:53,559 --> 00:25:00,029
for it's just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ban you which is</font>

00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:02,590
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem but generally we've had good</font>

experience with networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cal is scaled</font>

532
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:08,918
well for bigger for bigger networks now

533
00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:11,499
use these a lot in my smaller client and

534
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:14,320
farming<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sub clients so the only in</font>

535
00:25:11,499 --> 00:25:17,759
questions I told you I could run through

536
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,759
this fast yes you and

537
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:37,000
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when we purple team</font>

538
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what we're doing is we're</font>

539
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,930
coming those red teamers and we're

540
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:42,730
saying hey how can we help you so it's a

541
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:46,900
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of skipping down the highway holding</font>

542
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:49,090
hands I don't know that people

543
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,400
understand what red teaming is sometimes

544
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:53,649
so you have to lift them understand what

545
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,920
red teaming is maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'd be ready for</font>

546
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:58,600
Red Team Red Team engagement of pure

547
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,760
penetration<font color="#CCCCCC"> test that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to help</font>

548
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:04,209
them become a mature organization first

549
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,490
and purple teaming is about helping an

550
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:08,830
organization grow their security program

551
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:12,250
to become educated on their security

552
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:15,340
program more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than anything else does it</font>

553
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:17,950
answer your question or not do as much

554
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:21,240
network defense as I do offensive stuff

555
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:24,160
I mean I spend as<font color="#E5E5E5"> much time defending</font>

556
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,800
defending networks to this day<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

557
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,810
someone got pwned or you know you're

560
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,780
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an event that's coming up in a</font>

561
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,970
couple months so I do a lot of that too

562
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:41,290
and I'll see it now I do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of for</font>

00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:56,800
really weird problem but you know I went
