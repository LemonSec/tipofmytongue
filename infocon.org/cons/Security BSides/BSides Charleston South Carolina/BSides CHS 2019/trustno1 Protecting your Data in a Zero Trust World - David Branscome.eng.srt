1
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,340
welcome everyone my name is Dave Brandt

2
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,640
skom title of this session is trust no

3
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,560
one protecting your data in a zero trust

4
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,890
world so this is me I am a partner

5
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,950
technical security architect for

6
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,230
Microsoft I'm based out of Raleigh North

7
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,300
Carolina I've been with Microsoft for

8
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,699
about 12 years about 20 years in the

9
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:50,440
industry I worked in Microsoft

10
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,140
consulting services in their premier

11
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,760
organization and now I work with the

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,129
partner organization helping Microsoft

13
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:00,339
partners understand how to implement and

14
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:04,360
secure Microsoft products so I've got a

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,390
couple certifications and I would always

16
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,610
rather be at the beach maybe not in the

17
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,010
water today but definitely would rather

18
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,990
be at the beach that's just kind of

19
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,240
where we're I'm happy how many of you

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,140
are running off the 365 Microsoft 365

21
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,640
EMS that sort of thing

22
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,619
whew ok all right so here's the part of

23
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:32,860
the session where I show you how very

24
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,600
very old I am ok so what do you guys

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,770
remember about 1998 anybody working back

26
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:47,260
in 1998 a couple people all right any of

27
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,460
you remember this guy doesn't that

28
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,280
doesn't Hillary look weird

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,700
that's not her

30
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,720
anybody have one of those still hold

31
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,810
discman this is what the ipods used to

32
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,919
look like kids anybody remember this

33
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,680
game where Michael Jordan was sick the

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,920
last game of the the championship and

35
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,450
still hit the game-winning shot and this

36
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,050
one is for Matty stone although she left

37
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,140
this was the year that Google started

38
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,870
1998 so a lot of things happen back in

39
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,300
1998 this is one of the things I

40
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,100
remember from 1998 and how many of you

41
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,150
remember Novell yeah so Novell and NT

42
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,150
for that was a big fight going on right

43
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,780
there and as you can see Novell look

44
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,080
pretty shiny and good and they were

45
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,850
beating the pants off of nt4 for a

46
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,030
little while but things changed very

47
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,690
quickly now the time that I was working

48
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,000
in 1998 I was working at the Pacific

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,070
Stock Exchange in San Francisco that was

50
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,900
when San Francisco had a stock exchange

51
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,810
they no longer do but one of the things

52
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,190
that was happening was they were

53
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,410
converting the trading floor for the

54
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,900
stock exchange from a mainframe based

55
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,540
system over to Windows 2000 and Active

56
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,120
Directory and they were using change and

57
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,250
sequel 2000 and all that everything

58
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,080
Microsoft that was bright and shiny and

59
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,780
new was going into the the trading

60
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,430
system that has nothing to do with why

61
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,080
there's no longer a stock exchange in

62
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,590
San Francisco but that was that was what

63
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,620
we were doing and at that point I became

64
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,550
the Windows 2000 admin for the stock

65
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,610
exchange and that was my absolutely

66
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,410
unguessable password

67
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,250
trust no one I was certain nobody would

68
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,060
guess that thing okay so it's fast

69
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,750
forward 15 years to 2013 so I'm working

70
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,760
at Microsoft by this point I've got a

71
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,510
little bit better grasp on what a secure

72
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,520
password looks like and I'm rummaging

73
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,340
around on pastebin

74
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,459
and what do I see number nine right so

75
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:15,299
so trust no one was slightly less

76
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,440
guessable than one two three four five

77
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,970
six seven so so I was doing somewhat

78
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:27,550
better right then we fast forward to

79
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,800
today and how many of you seen these

80
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,650
information is beautiful word clouds

81
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,080
anybody seen these so these are the the

82
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:46,510
most popular passwords right so the the

83
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,810
height determines the popularity of the

84
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,040
password and where it is on on the

85
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,880
horizontal axis determines the

86
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,250
complexity I believe what they were

87
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,479
doing so it was fairly non complex and

88
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,110
easily guessable so I was disappointing

89
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,609
let's fast forward to today

90
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,830
these are some pretty scary statistics

91
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,320
and these are statistics that I got out

92
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,160
of Microsoft's database of information

93
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,560
not too long ago a couple months ago

94
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,930
this one's pretty fascinating by 2021

95
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,480
just two years from now 25 percent of

96
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,820
the world's personal data will be

97
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,300
compromised and housed in a data Lake to

98
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,670
be analyzed and utilized by consortiums

99
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,600
of threat actors 25 percent of the

100
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,810
world's personal data so that tells us

101
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,400
two things right it tells us first of

102
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,000
all that our data is not as secure as we

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,980
would like it to be but secondly that

104
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,650
the threat actors are collaborating on

105
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,840
these things right if they're putting

106
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,360
together these data lakes that they all

107
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,510
share from that tells us that that

108
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:08,700
they've got a some kind of deal going on

109
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,150
there's been a 750 percent growth in the

110
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,860
number of ransomware families just since

111
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,590
2016 or in 2016 and that's been growing

112
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,930
incrementally over the last couple years

113
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:28,480
as well I actually submitted a session

114
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,150
to different b-sides dealing with

115
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,640
ransomware and they sent me a response

116
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,680
back saying no thanks we don't feel that

117
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,340
ransomware is a relevant issue anymore

118
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,590
with with Pecha and not Pecha being

119
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:47,380
being done I was like ok how many of you

120
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,080
think that's true that ransomware is

121
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,390
done not even close

122
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,290
yeah it's all over the place then this

123
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,900
last one by 2022 a third of successful

124
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,900
attacks experienced by enterprises will

125
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,990
be on their shadow IT resources so when

126
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,960
we fertilize resources we're talking

127
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,010
about implementations of software within

128
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,230
an organization that the IT department

129
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,150
doesn't know about or doesn't control

130
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,520
right so somebody doesn't want to use

131
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,990
you know Microsoft Office or whatever it

132
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,680
is and so they buy you know a

133
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,390
subscription to Google suite or to

134
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,810
whatever right it's just a software

135
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,910
that's controlled outside of the IT

136
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,220
organization we see this happening a lot

137
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,730
in education because typically

138
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,730
departments have their own budgets and

139
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,710
they'll buy things that they want or

140
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,200
that they're familiar with and those

141
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,170
don't fall under the control of the

142
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,060
central IT department how many of you

143
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,170
have to deal with that kind of situation

144
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:03,410
it's difficult right so so when we take

145
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,650
these these three ideas together you

146
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,130
know the the lack of control of identity

147
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,580
the the compromise of devices and the

148
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,720
compromise of data I wasn't so far off

149
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,400
right we can't trust anyone we have to

150
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,580
be in this mental model of trusting no

151
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,860
one on our network the fact is though

152
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,630
security used to be what we thought was

153
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,419
simple right it kind of looked like this

154
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:38,479
we had a gigantic firewall and we opened

155
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,640
some ports and everything was great

156
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,970
right but that's that's no longer the

157
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,620
way the world works today we have people

158
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,980
that have mobile devices they bring

159
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,460
their own devices there's many different

160
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:57,190
cloud providers and that that results in

161
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,170
significant challenges for the IT

162
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,450
department to me

163
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,830
so we have this concept called zero

164
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,890
trust and this isn't a new concept it's

165
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,080
not a concept that is exclusive to

166
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,570
Microsoft Google has their version of

167
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,100
zero trust called beyond Corp and if if

168
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,750
you want to see how Microsoft implement

169
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,510
zero trust go to that URL that's that's

170
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,360
our thinking on how to implement a zero

171
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,930
trust model but but if you if you narrow

172
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,940
it down there's there's really three

173
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,640
steps to implementing zero trust and

174
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,790
I'll show you how that can be done in

175
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,149
some demos here in just a few minutes

176
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,709
but at its root what does zero trust

177
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:44,040
mean it means basically that we take a

178
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,470
look at workloads that users are trying

179
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,410
to access whether it be exchange or an

180
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,430
HR application or Salesforce or Google

181
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,209
suite or box or Dropbox or whatever we

182
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:58,890
see who the user is that's trying to

183
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,070
access it what device they're trying to

184
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,649
access it from and we wrap some

185
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:07,560
intelligence around that and we grant

186
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,500
them access or deny access to that data

187
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,940
based on the sum total of those values

188
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,820
right if you think about the attack kill

189
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,190
chain and and most of you are probably

190
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,860
familiar with how the attack killed

191
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,279
chain works typically in a Microsoft

192
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,610
network mean this is applicable and in

193
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,399
most environments but since most

194
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,750
environments involve Microsoft networks

195
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,860
or Microsoft hosts and endpoints at some

196
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,160
level this is kind of how it works most

197
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,829
of the exploits and most of the

198
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:50,820
compromises of a an endpoint will happen

199
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,890
because the user goes to a website or

200
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:56,130
they click on a phishing email there are

201
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,810
statistics that say 4% of users will

202
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,820
always always click on an email that

203
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,610
they get they will always click on a

204
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,300
link in an email that's not that's not

205
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:12,870
good

206
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,839
right so so 4% of people will always

207
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,510
click on a URL that if you're an

208
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,329
attacker that's pretty decent odds right

209
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:23,640
if you send 100 emails four people are

210
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,230
gonna click on it and you've got

211
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,600
possible ownership of the box right

212
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,399
that's that's pretty decent odds so the

213
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,399
phishing email either they click on a

214
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,000
URL they open an attachment and the user

215
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,610
account has been exploited and maybe

216
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,730
they install some malware now within

217
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,040
Microsoft and I'm not I'm not going to

218
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,880
try to get into a lot of you know salesy

219
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,069
kind of thing I'm just illustrating if

220
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:55,020
you have a Microsoft network there are

221
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,290
controls in place that you can use to

222
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,180
mitigate some of these issues so office

223
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,720
ATP advanced email threat protection we

224
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,060
have the concept of safe attachments and

225
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,180
safe links so with safe attachments what

226
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,160
we do is if an attachment comes in and

227
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,970
we're unsure of it we we can disconnect

228
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,730
that attachment from the email open it

229
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,270
in a sandboxed virtual VM in our data

230
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,520
centers see what the behavior of that

231
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,560
attachment is whether it's you know

232
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,170
dropping some code if it's trying to

233
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,740
establish connection out to serve rather

234
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,449
the internet whatever it is and if we

235
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:35,370
determine that behavior to be malicious

236
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,569
then we won't deliver that attachment

237
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:42,750
similarly with the safe URLs what

238
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,540
happens is if an email gets sent we look

239
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,490
at the URL if the URL looks to be

240
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,010
malicious then of course we won't allow

241
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,319
people to click on it but the thing that

242
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:56,130
makes it unique is that it's always at

243
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,290
the point of time when the user clicks

244
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,569
on it so what we've seen in some cases

245
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:05,130
is a threat actor will send a link to a

246
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,350
bunch of users in an organization and

247
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,390
there will be nothing malicious behind

248
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,850
the link at the time that they deliver

249
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,670
it so it gets through gets to the

250
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,680
mailboxes everybody has access to this

251
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,839
thing and then once they're confident

252
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,660
that it's gotten to everybody's mailbox

253
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,130
then they'll activate something behind

254
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,280
the link

255
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,650
right so that then when you click on the

256
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,220
link it does something bad so safe links

257
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,680
will check it every time the user clicks

258
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,750
whether it's 20 minutes after they get

259
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,910
the email or 20 days after they get the

260
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,350
email whatever we're always gonna go

261
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,140
check and see what that URL is trying to

262
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,700
do so those are a couple things that we

263
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,550
do that help mitigate these two issues

264
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,280
there's also the possibility that an

265
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,680
attacker will try to brute force an

266
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,270
account or you stolen account

267
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,130
credentials and then we have things like

268
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,930
azure ad identity protection which I'll

269
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,840
show you in just a few minutes they

270
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,300
establish command and control they've

271
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,770
compromised the user account they

272
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,880
establish persistent persistence and

273
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,110
then from there then they can start

274
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,510
making lateral movements across the

275
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,430
network right so then they can start

276
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,230
doing past the hash attacks or golden

277
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,290
ticket or whatever it might be and until

278
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,940
they finally find a privileged account

279
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,670
compromised that account and can elevate

280
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,830
their privileges and start doing bad

281
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,820
stuff and one of the things that they

282
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,820
typically want to do is establish domain

283
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,510
persistence and with that we have this

284
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,260
Asher ATP or Azure advanced advanced

285
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,270
threat analytics is anybody use advanced

286
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,170
threat analytics in their environment

287
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,640
Azure advanced threat analytics oh so

288
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,220
the basic idea behind this is we look at

289
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,800
the traffic that's going from any

290
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,070
endpoint to a domain controller and if

291
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,580
we see behavior that for example is a

292
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,570
pass the hash attack or a golden ticket

293
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:11,260
attack or an RDP brute-force attack or

294
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,320
whatever it might be we understand what

295
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,900
that looks like and so we'll alert you

296
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,390
to that and we'll also give you a map of

297
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,430
how this attack has taken place

298
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,370
so as r8 a is a pretty pretty cool tool

299
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,950
as Raby privileged Identity Management

300
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,800
this is the the concept of just-in-time

301
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,770
access and just enough access so rather

302
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,570
than having standing global admin

303
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,780
privileges on something

304
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,760
we give you the access when you need it

305
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,190
for the time that you need it and only

306
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,470
the amount of privilege or the amount of

307
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,500
access that you need so those type of

308
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,860
things help to limit the the

309
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,750
opportunities for attackers to establish

310
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,480
this type of persistence on your network

311
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,760
and then of course one of the things

312
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,650
that the the attackers want to do is

313
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,450
access your data and exfiltrate your

314
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,410
data and one of the tools that we have

315
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,360
there is Microsoft cloud app security is

316
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,010
anybody using that you're using it one

317
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,830
person all right when when I show this

318
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,290
to you I hope that you'll change your

319
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,150
mind about that because it is one of the

320
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:23,160
best tools that we've got out there and

321
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,770
it's getting better so that's the attack

322
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,270
kill chain those are some of the tools

323
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,340
that Microsoft gives you to to to

324
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,190
mitigate these attacks but again getting

325
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,610
back to the idea of a zero trust network

326
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,950
what are the elements of this zero trust

327
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,500
network so the first is that identity

328
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,580
becomes the control plane so we used to

329
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:49,680
have things like Ackles on documentation

330
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,960
you know if you if you had a Windows

331
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,650
server and you had a file server and you

332
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,220
establish NTFS permissions on those

333
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,720
documents and so forth that was kind of

334
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,000
how you controlled access to that hmm

335
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,849
but let me ask you a question let's say

336
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:10,890
I build an NT or a Windows server and I

337
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,190
put NTFS permissions on a document and I

338
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,280
lock that document down so that I am the

339
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,640
only human on earth that has permissions

340
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,960
to that document so if I try to send

341
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,329
that to you within my network can you

342
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:32,250
open that document No within the network

343
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,080
you can't what if I send it to your

344
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,890
Gmail account can you open that document

345
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,920
sure can right so we have to have

346
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,210
something that where the identity is

347
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,970
linked to your permissions

348
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,450
mm-hmm and so that's where the idea of

349
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,850
Azure information protection comes in

350
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:57,470
where your identity is majeure and

351
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,080
whether I sent it to you in Gmail or

352
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,380
whatever it's gonna validate whether you

353
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,360
have permissions to open that document

354
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,880
to do things with that document and if

355
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,460
you're not validated then you simply

356
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,980
have no no permissions to that document

357
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,320
assume every resource is on the open

358
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,070
Internet this is not a misspelling that

359
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,440
is not supposed to say Internet it is

360
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,240
actually supposed to say intent right so

361
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,309
so what we're doing is we're taking the

362
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:32,480
sum total of the behaviors here on the

363
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,830
right-hand side from from your

364
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,070
perspective we're looking at the

365
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,299
identity we're looking at the device

366
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:40,010
we're looking at the location that

367
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,539
they're logging in from what workload

368
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:43,309
are they trying to get to and then we do

369
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:46,580
some risk scoring and then that's going

370
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,030
to add that all up and it's going to

371
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,460
equal what we believe to be the intent

372
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,070
of the user and if we think that the

373
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,860
intent of the user is malicious then

374
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,130
we'll look it so that's what's going on

375
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:05,960
there so this is true even within

376
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,250
Microsoft so if I am trying to access

377
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,450
our HR system and I'm inside Microsoft's

378
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,659
corporate network I still have to be

379
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:20,890
authenticated I still have to sometimes

380
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:26,299
verify my identity by by doing a

381
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:27,860
multi-factor authentication things like

382
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,530
that but when I come here and I log into

383
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,780
the network here I'm absolutely going to

384
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,289
be prompted for MFA if I'm at home and

385
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:38,720
it knows that that's an established

386
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,900
trusted location for me that I log in

387
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,090
there from on a regular basis

388
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,100
then it might only prompt me every 30

389
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,840
day is there every 60 days for

390
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,270
multi-factor authentication but we're

391
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,720
assuming that everything is the wide

392
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,440
open Internet

393
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,830
and then this idea of never trusting

394
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,730
always verifying so prove to me who you

395
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,270
are

396
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,450
show me that you are who you claim to be

397
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,170
whether that be with a password or some

398
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:17,990
kind of a token or a password or a code

399
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,030
that's sent to Microsoft Authenticator

400
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,660
app or to your text via text to your

401
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,360
phone whatever it is you have to verify

402
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,120
who you are so again we come back to

403
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,800
this idea of never trust so again trust

404
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,570
no one

405
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:39,800
so I'm still on track right all right

406
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,820
let's take a look at some of these

407
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:50,450
things incidentally how many of you have

408
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:55,160
seen this feature in PowerPoint right

409
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,920
now it's translating live into Danish

410
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,680
anybody speak Danish so I speak Danish

411
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,270
and that is a pretty good translation of

412
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,900
English into Danish and there's a whole

413
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,010
bunch of different languages that you

414
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,900
can you can translate into so if you go

415
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,080
here to slide show always use subtitles

416
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,980
subtitle settings you can define come on

417
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,300
click well eventually it'll click and

418
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,340
it'll show me the different languages

419
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,620
that it can translate into as well as

420
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,270
what it what it believes to be the

421
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:35,060
spoken language or what it's expecting

422
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:40,000
the spoken language to be locked up here

423
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,070
come on

424
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,410
try this real quick

425
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:19,389
sure why it's locked up on me

426
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,490
try again

427
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,280
all right Murray start real quick so how

428
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,710
many of you have some form of a zero

429
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,870
trust network established in your

430
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:45,560
environment okay

431
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,650
what's what's the the the mechanism that

432
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:52,660
you're using to us to create that that

433
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,200
cool cool

434
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:46,460
how do you manage mobile devices like

435
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,160
our users allowed to bring mobile

436
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,620
devices from home or they manage by the

437
00:23:52,620 --> 00:24:38,540
corporate okay got a managed browser yep

438
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,190
well oh there we go looks like I got

439
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:46,490
connection now okay let's try this again

440
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:55,850
so login to my demo tenant nice

441
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,310
it only gets better

442
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,419
that's not trust no one the password by

443
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:17,700
the way okay so it's prompted me career

444
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,280
all right mm-hmm sorry about the delay

445
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,360
there okay so if I go to my admin portal

446
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,300
in office 365 and this is actually an M

447
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,540
365 tenant so MVC everybody better

448
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,610
understand that ever between office 365

449
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:46,600
and Microsoft 365 so office 365 is your

450
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,110
outlook Word PowerPoint you know teams

451
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,280
that kind of stuff

452
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,020
Microsoft 365 is office 365 plus Windows

453
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,340
10 plus enterprise mobility and security

454
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:09,370
ok let's open up the admin portal and if

455
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:14,590
I go to Azure Active Directory this a

456
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,159
little bit bigger

457
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,460
anybody following the the announcements

458
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:25,690
from ignite this week there's some

459
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,790
pretty cool stuff that came out from

460
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,220
Microsoft this week one of the the big

461
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,620
ones that's getting a lot of buzz is

462
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,920
Azure Ark where we can manage multiple

463
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,559
cloud environments so your AWS

464
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,510
environment your Google environment and

465
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:44,070
all that stuff from from one location

466
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,178
all right go to Azure Active Directory

467
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,609
all right hmm so I'm here my azure

468
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:07,169
active directory and if I go to the

469
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:12,690
conditional access area I'll show you

470
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:15,619
how easy it is to set up a zero trust

471
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:21,629
network policy in an environment okay so

472
00:27:21,629 --> 00:27:23,129
one of the first things that I want to

473
00:27:23,129 --> 00:27:25,950
do is established a named location so a

474
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,440
named location is a set of IP addresses

475
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,299
that I trust

476
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:33,299
so maybe my internal network or maybe

477
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:34,769
not that I trust but that I have a

478
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:36,839
higher level of confidence in that

479
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:39,899
subnet for example so I go here to named

480
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:43,139
locations and I've created one here

481
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:44,909
called Charleston b-sides but I'll show

482
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:47,099
you how easy it is all right so I can

483
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:52,950
call it Charleston besides - and what it

484
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,669
is is it's looking at IP ranges or

485
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:58,649
countries or regions so maybe I don't

486
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:00,960
trust North Korea maybe I don't trust

487
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,029
Iran right so I can establish you know

488
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:09,359
network blocks for for those IP ranges

489
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,879
but let's say I want to mark one of

490
00:28:11,879 --> 00:28:15,629
these as a trusted location and then I

491
00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:17,339
just say when I - one sixty eight dot

492
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:22,200
zero dot 0 slash 24 I think that's how

493
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,889
it wants it yep I know

494
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,100
and I misspelled Charleston but anyway

495
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,320
you get the idea so so now I've

496
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,720
established that that is a trusted

497
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,290
location I can establish custom controls

498
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,900
- this is something that is relatively

499
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,120
new but what this requires is you have

500
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,700
to edit this JSON file that's gonna pop

501
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,600
up here and your you can add things like

502
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,420
duo and you know other third-party

503
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,800
authentication providers in here as

504
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,400
being a requirement for the conditional

505
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,660
access setup you can require Terms of

506
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,640
Use to be accepted when people log in

507
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,200
that kind of thing

508
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,150
VPN connectivity if you're still using

509
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:14,660
VPN Microsoft used to use a VPN we don't

510
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,470
use it anymore

511
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:18,440
because the the concept of zero trust

512
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,230
means there's there's nobody that you

513
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:24,320
trust even if they VPN in so we just

514
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,600
don't use it and then there's some

515
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,460
classic policies here that you can use

516
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,590
but let's go ahead and create a policy

517
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,980
so I'll call this Charleston and I'll

518
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:45,500
spell it right trust box okay so what

519
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,020
I'm going to do here is say that if a

520
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,560
user is logging in from the Charleston

521
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,020
'besides subnet which is a 192 168

522
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,780
subnet and they're a member of a certain

523
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,030
group and they're trying to access box

524
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,190
then I'm going to require multi-factor

525
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,400
authentication okay so let's say that

526
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,460
the group of users let's say all users

527
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,870
oh wait

528
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:12,050
even better let's say all guests and

529
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:15,350
external users okay so so what this

530
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,720
means is if you have partners or

531
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,090
organizations that you work with you can

532
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,310
say sure you can access my network

533
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,590
you're going to be subject to a set of

534
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,290
policies that may be different than what

535
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,300
my internal people have so you may

536
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,130
require your external vendors or

537
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,560
external partners to always use

538
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,200
multi-factor authentication you may

539
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,330
require that those devices are never

540
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,910
jailbroken you may require that those

541
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:41,900
devices

542
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,690
are always encrypted whereas you don't

543
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,520
require the same thing of your internal

544
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,000
users let's go ahead and do this so

545
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,310
we're saying all guest users now it's

546
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,140
gonna look at the cloud apps that I've

547
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:59,030
got defined mm-hmm and notice this isn't

548
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,820
just Microsoft applications right so I

549
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:06,170
got box so I can control access to box a

550
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,600
corporate and installation a box I can

551
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,910
establish the same thing for Salesforce

552
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,430
right whatever applications I'm

553
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:17,390
integrating my Adger ad logins with so I

554
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,940
can use Azure ad to log into Salesforce

555
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,450
I can use Azure ad to login to box when

556
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,880
I establish that as the authentication

557
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,680
mechanism member identity is the control

558
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,600
plane if I establish that as the the

559
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,460
authentication mechanism then I'm able

560
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:39,650
to use that as I'm allowed to control

561
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,860
the applications that use that alright

562
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:47,900
so I'm using box and then what are the

563
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,900
conditions under which a user will be

564
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,320
granted access so as your ad identity

565
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,460
protection looks at different factors of

566
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,910
a user's login where they logging in

567
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:04,310
from when was the last time they logged

568
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,510
in from this place

569
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,610
are they logging in with a browser or

570
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:10,100
they log in with an application what

571
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,650
kind of browser are they logging in with

572
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,630
are they using Chrome is that their

573
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,870
typical browser right so if I all of a

574
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,090
sudden start logging in with a browser

575
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:22,220
that Microsoft has never seen me logging

576
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,740
in with that's gonna raise my risk it's

577
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,540
gonna say this isn't typically how he

578
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,590
logs in so maybe this is a problem it's

579
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,690
not gonna stop me but it's it's gonna

580
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:35,750
raise the list of the risk factor so I'm

581
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:40,000
gonna say yes if I'm at a medium risk

582
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,950
device platform so which applicator

583
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,560
which devices are am I allowed to login

584
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,840
with so I've got external users I'm

585
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,980
gonna say they're gonna login with

586
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,040
Android devices iOS devices

587
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,780
nobody has Windows Phone any more

588
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,280
windows and

589
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:01,820
os locations and I'm gonna say not

590
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,100
trusted locations because external users

591
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,330
not going to be in my trusted locations

592
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:13,340
so I will exclude trusted locations and

593
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,660
then depending on what application

594
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,670
they're using so if they're logging with

595
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:20,530
a browser or a mobile app or whatever

596
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,180
and then what's the state of the device

597
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:27,590
is the device as radiant is it marked as

598
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,650
compliant so have ID marked that devices

599
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,620
as complying with the policies so if

600
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,540
this is an external user a guest user I

601
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,010
probably don't have the ability to

602
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,560
control whether the device is compliant

603
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,040
so I'm not going to configure that okay

604
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,350
and now so I've established the

605
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:48,320
conditions for the access now I'm gonna

606
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,610
stablish the access so I can say if they

607
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:55,790
meet all these conditions then I'm going

608
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,820
to require multi-factor authentication

609
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,230
and I can require more than one right

610
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:03,290
but for for an external user I think

611
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:07,310
that's a reasonable amount and I can

612
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:10,159
also establish session control so

613
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,820
session control means a browser session

614
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,739
how am I going to control the browser

615
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:19,040
session all right so I'm not gonna

616
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,980
change anything there and then I create

617
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:26,719
the policy and just like that what's

618
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,730
gonna happen now is if an external user

619
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,340
tries to login to my corporate

620
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,010
installation of box right I want to

621
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,469
grant them access to box they're going

622
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:38,239
to have to provide multi-factor

623
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,820
authentication in order to get that

624
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,969
access so that's the concept of zero

625
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:46,460
trust right now I can establish the same

626
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,570
policies for my internal people right I

627
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:53,630
can say as it does you know that one of

628
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,830
the baseline policies that we've

629
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,080
established here is require MFA for

630
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,530
admins require MFA for end users block

631
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,600
legacy authentication so it's blocking

632
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,700
some of the older protocols that are

633
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,290
usually compromised

634
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:07,850
these are going to be defaults by the

635
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:08,950
way

636
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,690
starting I think this month or next

637
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:14,230
month I can remember what the what the

638
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:17,230
the timing on that was but for all new

639
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:20,350
tenants it's going to turn on with those

640
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,950
policies activated because people just

641
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:28,600
don't turn them on so in this case for

642
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,150
example I've got a policy setup for

643
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,210
Salesforce and what I've done is say if

644
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,530
you're a member of the sales and

645
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,480
marketing group and you want to access

646
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,430
Salesforce then I am going to use a

647
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:45,150
conditional access application control

648
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,980
okay so so let's let's look at this what

649
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,710
this is saying is if you're inside my

650
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,000
network and you're trying to get to

651
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,020
Salesforce I'm going to establish a set

652
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,110
of controls on your browser session okay

653
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,300
now let's find out where that actually

654
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,800
gets implemented if I go to cloud app

655
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,140
security which I think you were the only

656
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,580
one that said that you're using cloud

657
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,910
app security but if we go to cloud app

658
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:15,370
security what this is is a cloud app

659
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:18,370
security broker right so any cloud

660
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,050
applications that you're trying to

661
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,840
access from inside my corporate network

662
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,660
I'm going to watch your access to that

663
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,990
and I'm going to allow disallow based on

664
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:33,340
the criteria that you have there are

665
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:37,660
more resources cloud app this is one of

666
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,020
the one of the best tools that we have

667
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,650
in my opinion because it just makes so

668
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,660
much sense when you look at it it's a

669
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,690
it's a very logical tool and it does a

670
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,510
whole lot let me make this a little bit

671
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,720
bigger

672
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,910
all right so what this is showing me

673
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,310
here is these are the applications that

674
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:02,069
I am controlling with cloud app security

675
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:05,900
so notice I'm managing ServiceNow

676
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:10,650
Salesforce a corporate installation of

677
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:13,530
box which we knew already right and what

678
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,050
it's doing is its watching the the

679
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:17,579
traffic who it's coming from what IP

680
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:20,369
address is coming from what the behavior

681
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:22,920
is what is it you're trying to do when

682
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,319
you get there so we have api's that

683
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:28,859
connect to for example g suite right so

684
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:31,970
if i see a user moving a file from

685
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:35,790
sharepoint to a corporate installation

686
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:39,450
of g drive right Google Drive and and

687
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,890
I'm managing it with cloud app security

688
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:44,099
I watch as that file gets moved over

689
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:47,160
there and if I look in that file alright

690
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,780
I can establish up a policy that says

691
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,660
look in that file and if you see PII

692
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,410
data if you see credit cards if you see

693
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:58,650
a bank routing number whatever then

694
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,940
encrypt that file and and go ahead and

695
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,010
store it on Google Drive so even though

696
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,040
it's stored outside of Microsoft's you

697
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,740
know or our services we can still

698
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:15,510
establish control over that data so

699
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:23,760
let's take a look go to connected apps

700
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,819
so this is the the set of connectors

701
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:28,349
that I've got right now

702
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:31,380
the this one just my instance of

703
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,450
ServiceNow just spun down it's a virtual

704
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,819
machine so there's no connection but you

705
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:38,010
see I'm established I've established

706
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,920
connections to box and Salesforce but I

707
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,400
can also make connections to these other

708
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,040
services so cisco webex Amazon Web

709
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,800
Services so if you want to monitor what

710
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,339
people are doing in AWS if you want to

711
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:55,800
see who spun up a machine who deleted a

712
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,930
virtual machine who created a certain

713
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:02,660
service in AWS we have the api's or we

714
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:06,200
use the API is that AWS it exposes

715
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,060
and we can tell you this is what's

716
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:12,279
happening so this is what it looks like

717
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:15,619
they go into the alerts mm-hmm here's an

718
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:19,280
example a file containing PCI was

719
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,140
detected in the cloud okay so what this

720
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:30,920
shows me is let's see there so it tells

721
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,140
me the exact file right where it's

722
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:38,450
located who the user was right so this

723
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,160
is you know bad guy is the name of the

724
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,000
the directory that I created tells me

725
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,920
who was opening it when they opened it

726
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,680
why it triggered a policy any kind of

727
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,829
information about you know who else has

728
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:58,790
access to this file so collaborators so

729
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,589
I get information there one of the the

730
00:40:00,589 --> 00:40:04,220
great tools that's available here is we

731
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:08,599
track breaches of cloud applications so

732
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:11,270
here for example a discovered app

733
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:15,680
security breach so in this case the

734
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,650
breach was for sprint nextel they were

735
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:23,119
breached on July 15th 2019 it asked me

736
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,839
you know if if users on my network we're

737
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:28,700
going to sprint nextel they could

738
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,859
potentially be subject to this breach or

739
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:33,650
have been compromised in this breach so

740
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,450
I can go back and look and see which

741
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:38,900
users went to sprint nextel and then

742
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,030
tell them you know did you know that

743
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:43,099
this data was compromised

744
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:44,750
maybe reset your password or do whatever

745
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,890
kind of remediation we need to do I can

746
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,690
also see things like activity from an

747
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,849
infrequent country now this is where it

748
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:55,550
gets interesting so I haven't been to

749
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:58,339
any external countries recently right

750
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:00,500
I've been logging in from the United

751
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,619
States as this user on a regular basis

752
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:06,619
but notice how granular it's looking at

753
00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:09,079
my behavior it's saying this is the

754
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:11,660
first time that office 365 was accessed

755
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:15,230
in 83 days by this user the first time

756
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,359
they accessed it in 40 days from the

757
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:18,720
United States

758
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,550
the United States was visited for the

759
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:23,760
first time in 90 days by this user this

760
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,920
is the first time a double device was

761
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,430
used in 135 days this is the first time

762
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:33,320
this IP address was accessed in 135 days

763
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,230
first time 18 T wireless was used to

764
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:40,170
access this so I mean these are all the

765
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:42,420
things that go into that risk scoring

766
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,120
that we talked about right so if it's

767
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,330
been

768
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,830
manectric its gonna say this has never

769
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,820
happened before something's different

770
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,920
right tells me that I was logging with

771
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,560
an Android device that I was logging in

772
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,900
with Chrome and that this was the first

773
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,630
time I used Chrome in 90 days mm-hmm

774
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:19,940
so all this type of stuff gives me

775
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:24,240
visibility into who's accessing the data

776
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,360
and what they what they're trying to do

777
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,530
with it if I go also to my Asscher ad

778
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,090
identity protection which is one of the

779
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,670
things I talked about how many of you

780
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:38,310
are familiar with the secure score tool

781
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:43,080
that we have in office 365 so how do you

782
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,279
like it and and be honest

783
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,730
yeah yeah and I think part of the

784
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:01,040
problem is that the scoring doesn't

785
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,140
change until it's like overnight or a

786
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,150
couple days after sometimes so so it's

787
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:08,120
not immediate but one of the things that

788
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,250
Microsoft is doing is going to the score

789
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:15,500
based security so we know or we feel we

790
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:20,210
know what what constitutes good security

791
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:23,840
controls in office 365 in Azure ad in

792
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,890
Azure and so we're saying if you

793
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:30,920
implement NFA that's good so here's 50

794
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,730
points if you are protecting your files

795
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:37,220
using onedrive and SharePoint we feel

796
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,260
that's good here's 20 points so so the

797
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:42,230
higher your score goes that's a way of

798
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:45,260
measuring the level of security you've

799
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,790
got for your data for your identities

800
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:52,220
and so on so as we look at as rady

801
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,590
Identity Protection one of the things

802
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,090
that I had mentioned was this idea of

803
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:01,700
risky sign ins right so these are the

804
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,880
users that have been tagged as being at

805
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,960
risk so an Rico Captain EO is considered

806
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,180
at risk so let's take a look at why

807
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:17,840
potentially that's the case not easy to

808
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,700
see it with let me just scrunch it down

809
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,930
a little bit okay so hopefully you can

810
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:27,190
see this what it's looking at here is

811
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:30,440
you know when they logged in what the

812
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:36,560
office location was no risky sign ins no

813
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,070
problems their risk history though

814
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:42,170
anonymous IP address so maybe somebody

815
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:46,040
logged in with a tor browser okay

816
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,220
so a tor browser from our perspective if

817
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,540
you're logging in with the tor browser

818
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:55,600
that by itself is a little sketchy

819
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,960
there's there's no legitimate reason why

820
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,040
somebody would need to be logging in

821
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,620
with the tor browser other than to hide

822
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:07,670
themselves which is kind of silly when

823
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,510
you think about it because

824
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:12,870
it's pretty well known like the CIA and

825
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:16,290
FBI and NSA put nodes all across the Tor

826
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:19,080
network so that they can watch what's

827
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,430
going on on the Tor network it's not

828
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,740
it's not as secure as you think it is

829
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,910
right

830
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:27,720
anyway so so we can look at this type of

831
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,030
behavior and then we can say things like

832
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:33,240
if this type of behavior happens force

833
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,760
him to change his password or force him

834
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,700
next time to login with that with MFA

835
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,510
right so these are types of things that

836
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:46,440
that we can put controls around one last

837
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,050
thing and and then then I'll be just

838
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:51,660
about done here's the the secure score

839
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,270
thing that I was telling you about

840
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:57,060
so in this case my secure score is 28%

841
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,250
which is pretty abysmal because I don't

842
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,460
really do a whole lot in this tenant to

843
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,330
lock it down

844
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:06,660
but you notice I can control things if

845
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:11,010
you can read it I can control things by

846
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:14,060
identity by the data protection

847
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,350
mechanisms that I'm using the devices

848
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:19,290
how I'm protecting the devices the

849
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,930
applications on my network and then even

850
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:24,060
the infrastructure so you can put

851
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,470
controls around your azure

852
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,740
infrastructure and say I see that the

853
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:33,060
azure virtual machine the the the drives

854
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,590
are not BitLocker

855
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:37,670
there's no endpoint protection on these

856
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:41,190
virtual machines or they aren't being

857
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:43,290
backed up or there's no redundancy

858
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:47,820
things like that that would would secure

859
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,180
your environment and there's also now a

860
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:54,360
compliance score okay so if you're

861
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,000
subject to compliance regulations in

862
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
your environment there's a compliance

863
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,980
score that allows you to measure how

864
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,650
you're doing against various compliance

865
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:07,590
regulations so that's something that was

866
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:12,800
announced this week all right so let's

867
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:18,060
kind of wrap things up here to open up

868
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,010
my

869
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:24,090
PowerPoint Hubble will crash again

870
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:35,819
just speak English alright yeah I'm not

871
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:39,319
sure what would cause that

872
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:49,880
so there it is see if it speaks Danish

873
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,559
there it is

874
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,700
okay so protecting your data in your

875
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,039
corporate environment requires that you

876
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:00,900
have to you have to protect your

877
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,170
identities right we have to secure the

878
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:06,869
identity first and that's the control

879
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:08,940
plane that we talked about that's going

880
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:10,529
to grant access to all these other

881
00:48:10,529 --> 00:48:13,950
things so we come back to the original

882
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:16,640
point trust no one

883
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,109
so if you have any questions about the

884
00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:21,900
zero trust network that's again

885
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,059
Microsoft's implementation of zero trust

886
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:27,150
that's my blog cloudy happy people who

887
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,890
gets that and it's gonna be the old

888
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:30,900
people raising their hand anybody get

889
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,749
the reference cloudy happy people that's

890
00:48:33,749 --> 00:48:36,809
REM they were shiny happy people feel

891
00:48:36,809 --> 00:48:41,960
free to email me I'll I'll be happy to

892
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,740
connect with you on LinkedIn and

893
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:51,049
whatever so any questions yes sir

894
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:00,690
yes

895
00:49:13,539 --> 00:49:18,359
for for which which control

896
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:29,869
so okay I'm just doing me dead am I done

897
00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:32,780
oh well sorry

898
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:35,950
yeah so the question was how do we

899
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:38,720
secure score doesn't necessarily tell

900
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,260
you what licensing level you need to get

901
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:46,700
to a certain control so I'm not sure

902
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,440
that that's entirely true because the

903
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,770
the way it's set up is that it's

904
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:55,000
supposed to look at the applications and

905
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,910
licensing that you have and provide

906
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:00,980
recommendations based on that so if

907
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:02,810
there's if there's a specific control

908
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:06,260
that you're seeing maybe like for

909
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,470
example MFA you can implement MFA

910
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:12,680
without having like an azure ad premium

911
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:16,130
SKU there's there's other ways to do MFA

912
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:21,230
it's not you know the the most flexible

913
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:24,050
way to do MFA but but you can't do it

914
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:31,430
with other SKUs so I if mundane that by

915
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:36,650
any chance cuz because the idea is we're

916
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,240
only going to score you against what

917
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,390
you're licensed for and and what you've

918
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:44,240
enabled I mean we're not going to score

919
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,910
you negatively if you're you know

920
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,500
because you have zero in Azure

921
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,960
infrastructure but you have no no

922
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,830
virtual machines right but I mean it's

923
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:56,990
worth feel free to email me if you have

924
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:01,240
a question any other questions

925
00:51:03,299 --> 00:51:07,260
all right trust knowing everybody

926
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:10,919
[Applause]
