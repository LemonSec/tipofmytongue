1
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,870
welcome to Maddy stove

2
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:38,590
[Applause]

3
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,540
let's see if I can figure out how to

4
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,640
turn a microphone on there it goes so hi

5
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,130
thank y'all all for showing up early

6
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,990
morning on a Saturday a little chilly

7
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,880
and thank you to Paul and the rest of

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,070
the besides Charleston crew for having

9
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,980
me here I'm really excited and it's my

10
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,870
first time in Charleston and walking

11
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,640
around yesterday it's gorgeous and so

12
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,770
much good food so thanks for having me

13
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,900
but this morning I want to talk about

14
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,060
switching sides and sharing the

15
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,920
practical benefits that I've seen in

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,260
switching from red to blue to purple

17
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,070
so first Who am I my name is Maddie

18
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,680
stone my pronouns are she and her and as

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,440
Paul said I am a security researcher on

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,900
Google's project zero team and have been

21
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,509
in the InfoSec community for about seven

22
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:34,030
years now which has predominantly been

23
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,850
all reverse engineering but on a lot of

24
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,160
different sides which is sort of what I

25
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,160
want to talk about today I also like to

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,910
speak at things and do some other stuff

27
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,970
my twitter handle is Maddie stone really

28
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,650
great at OPSEC you know and everything

29
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,200
like that but that tends to be the

30
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,870
easiest way to get in touch with me and

31
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,820
I'd love to continue talking and

32
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,760
chatting with y'all after even today in

33
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,300
this conference but getting into this

34
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,880
what is my goal for this talk what am i

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,310
hoping to take advantage of this chance

36
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,100
but y'all are giving me you know an hour

37
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,489
of your time which you know Wow thank

38
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:19,540
you um is I want to encourage all of us

39
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,489
to continue to consider switching

40
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:24,700
between both the offensive and the

41
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,120
defensive security roles be willing to

42
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,970
try the other side even if we feel

43
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,370
really proud and really tied to the

44
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,900
current side we've been working on and

45
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,989
also talk about how together not just as

46
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:40,540
individuals I do believe it benefits all

47
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,630
of us to become more purple instead of

48
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,360
just starkly red or

49
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,770
is blue but first I'm gonna share this

50
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,770
in my points of view from my experiences

51
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,810
I can't really speak to each and

52
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,270
everyone else's so I want to share why I

53
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,160
believe it's important to switch from

54
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,320
red to blue why I think it can benefit

55
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,680
you from my experiences doing it and

56
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,780
really getting into sort of the tactical

57
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,180
practical benefits but sort of surprised

58
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,380
me and that I saw so yeah disclaimer my

59
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,690
opinions so just to level set what do we

60
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,420
mean by red and blue and purple what are

61
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,730
these different sides if you go ahead

62
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,100
and try to start googling looking for an

63
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,780
exact definition of what does it mean to

64
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,700
be red security what does it mean to be

65
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,860
blue you're gonna find a lot of

66
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,989
different opinions so before we get into

67
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:35,880
the rest of this I just wanted to talk

68
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,410
to you about where I'm coming from and

69
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,630
what I mean when I say those two so we

70
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,790
can sort of level-set so first red so to

71
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,180
me the red side of InfoSec is where

72
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,670
you're adopting the adversaries TTP's

73
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,120
meaning techniques tactics and

74
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,430
procedures as well as their point of

75
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,930
view in how to test an organization so

76
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,880
you're still doing this to make things

77
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,720
more secure but you're doing it from the

78
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,730
offensive point of view and you're

79
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,070
really trying to emulate and push that

80
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,030
device that enterprise that organization

81
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,640
in showing this is what the bad folks

82
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,640
are the bad actors could do to us so how

83
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,040
do we get better and securing against

84
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,010
that and here are some of the roles or

85
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,830
actions that to me clearly into red

86
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,470
and it's obviously not comprehensive but

87
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,690
first we have penetration testing which

88
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,270
is sort of the most broad you are trying

89
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,090
to break something that could be in the

90
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,550
hole into an organization it could be

91
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,320
trying to bring one specific piece of

92
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,050
software could be trying to get into and

93
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,419
steal information from a device but you

94
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,100
are trying to penetrate the security

95
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,050
boundaries as an attacker would the next

96
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,060
one instead of focusing more on this a

97
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,650
lot of the technical control

98
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,780
maybe physical controls you're focusing

99
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,360
on the human element of security so

100
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,699
that's social engineering and so those

101
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,070
might be included in pen tests in terms

102
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,800
of you know fishing exercises where

103
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,570
you're trying to craft fishing emails to

104
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,759
see how many people in our organization

105
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,310
is still didn't respond or fall for it

106
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,669
as well as trying to solicit people

107
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:22,530
information from the different

108
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,509
organization the next one getting more

109
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:30,240
into less of the human Enterprise

110
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,070
section more into just the technical

111
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,070
aspects is vulnerability research and so

112
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,560
that is where software device you are

113
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,440
looking for specific vulnerabilities but

114
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,270
then often through coordinated

115
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,169
disclosure or other things you are

116
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:48,630
trying to get patched and fixed so that

117
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,729
is the more targeted let's find that

118
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:53,910
vulnerability and get it fixed adversary

119
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,440
simulation being a sort of type of

120
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,720
penetration test in a lot of ways but in

121
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,789
an adversary simulation you are

122
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:06,180
specifically trying to use the exact

123
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,789
sort of modeling your behavior and

124
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:11,940
actions after a specific adversary so

125
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,639
sometimes that is for you know the

126
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,400
state-sponsored actors of they want to

127
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,979
do a really intensive penetration test

128
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,289
knowing this state-sponsored actor

129
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:24,150
usually has access to this type of

130
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,250
scientific equipment they usually have

131
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,590
this much skill this much money and so

132
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,789
we are going to do that much more

133
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,030
sophisticated or it could be our threat

134
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,840
is script kitties so we want to do an

135
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,180
adversary simulation of how far can

136
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,389
someone get by just using what you can

137
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:44,580
generally find on github or things like

138
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,500
that and then another form of read is

139
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,159
exploit development so you are maybe

140
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,380
doing vulnerability research maybe you

141
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,099
are trying to craft a patch so not just

142
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:01,500
using a zero-day but an IND a meaning it

143
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,229
should have been patched a few weeks a

144
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:06,599
few months a few years ago you go ahead

145
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:08,789
and weaponize it into an exploit to then

146
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:11,550
test against what your network or your

147
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,889
device or your corporation

148
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:17,009
and so these for me are all examples of

149
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,800
what read so it's a lot bigger than just

150
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,590
when we talk about a red team in an

151
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:27,270
exercise or a red cell within a security

152
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,729
team it's much more broad in all of

153
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:32,280
these actions that is doing security are

154
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,830
trying to do offense for the sake of

155
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,830
defense and on the other side of the

156
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,949
coin we have blue so the blue team's are

157
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:43,099
trying to protect though and

158
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:45,090
organization's infrastructures and

159
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,889
devices from the attack and so they're

160
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:48,780
also the ones building and maintaining

161
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,699
all of the defense's a.k doing the

162
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,469
defense for the sake of defense rather

163
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:57,930
than offense and just like red there are

164
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,150
a lot more than just the blue team on an

165
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,190
exercise or the blue cell they're doing

166
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,729
a whole lot of defensive defensive

167
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:08,310
actions I'm often using the same

168
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,560
technical techniques as the red side but

169
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,009
for a different purpose so security ops

170
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:16,560
centers socks and all everything that

171
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,659
goes along with that of monitoring

172
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:20,370
trying to understand when there might

173
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,590
have been an intrusion responding

174
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,270
deciding of it's false positive things

175
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,630
like that is obviously in the blue side

176
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:31,319
malware analysis so on red you may be

177
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,120
using reverse engineering skills for

178
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,860
vulnerability research exploit

179
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,809
development where you can use those

180
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,089
exact same skills for blue in terms of

181
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:40,708
malware analysis and making that

182
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,110
decision one is the sample good or bad

183
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,829
to how it is it work why might it be

184
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:47,579
successful

185
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:49,920
how much priority do we need assess and

186
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,810
learn and what type of defenses do we

187
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,320
need to build threat intelligence is

188
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,839
getting to behind that malware analysis

189
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,839
meaning who are the actors how is this

190
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,670
being used and the larger context

191
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,320
Incident Response is another category of

192
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,600
blue meaning we need to respond

193
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,370
immediately figure out what's going who

194
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:15,269
do we need to pull in and finally

195
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:18,060
digital forensics looking backwards to

196
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,120
decide what did happen versus what is

197
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,339
happening now what can we learn from it

198
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:24,540
how do we need to change

199
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,260
our actions and so this is a very broad

200
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,070
but quick overview of some of the types

201
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,440
of roles and actions that fall into red

202
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,390
and blue for me and while this might

203
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,760
have been a basics or a refresher for

204
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,770
some of you I wanted to make sure we're

205
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,870
all on the same page as we talk forward

206
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:48,470
and if oh okay I need an update Chrome

207
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:02,370
so if you did not see your role listed

208
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,370
here you know whether you're likely

209
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,610
doing security work or you are helping

210
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,650
security through offensive defensive and

211
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,340
it doesn't mean it's any less but so

212
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,770
let's just get a feel of who else is in

213
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,630
this room for us I'm going to ask you to

214
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,370
raise your hand if you identify more as

215
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,820
red if you identify more as blue or the

216
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,710
third option is none of the above all of

217
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,110
the above somewhere in the between so

218
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,260
first if you identify more on the side

219
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,150
of red security raise your hand okay we

220
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,410
got a sprinklin in here what about blue

221
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,330
sweet we got a lot of blue teamers and a

222
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,310
lot of pride associated with that too

223
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,440
and none of the above all of the above

224
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,890
something cool that's great so I'm glad

225
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,450
to see some one of y'all in the middle

226
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,000
too and I want to encourage you to

227
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,500
continue chatting with each other

228
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,140
finding someone who might work in a

229
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,940
different area than you do as we go

230
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,590
through today because sometimes these

231
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,350
events and conferences the talks are

232
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,120
great and I'm glad I'm not talking to an

233
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,870
empty room

234
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,700
but the networking is really one of

235
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,770
those aspects and learning about other

236
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,530
people's experiences and jobs is what we

237
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,150
can really get out of these types of

238
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:19,740
things so based on that why did I think

239
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,380
this talk might be interesting important

240
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,120
worthy spending an hour on and it's

241
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,880
largely because in the many years that

242
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,280
I've been in InfoSec including myself

243
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,040
you know looking at myself too is that

244
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,990
I've noticed there's a lot of I didn't

245
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,959
tea associated with whether you fall on

246
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,300
the red or the blue side of the spectrum

247
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,580
and there's a lot of pride with that and

248
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,190
having pride in our jobs is great but

249
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,170
not when it's to the detriment of seeing

250
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:54,020
this really start strong red vs. blue

251
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,760
paradigm that were not able to break out

252
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,440
of and so when I was thinking about this

253
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,990
I first in figuring out how did I want

254
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,270
this talk to go I decided to post a

255
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,089
tweet asking just what is it that draws

256
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:10,770
you to either the red or the blue side

257
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,230
of InfoSec what are the things that

258
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,020
you're interested in and just seeing

259
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,230
what the responses may be and it was

260
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,300
pretty maybe it was confirmation bias

261
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,430
but it was a pretty interesting and so

262
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,220
the tweet is also linked down at the

263
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,130
bottom when I'll share but the first one

264
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,779
I'm gonna go through some of the sample

265
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,959
responses so one is red is nice because

266
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,360
you get more tangible wins but sometimes

267
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,620
feels like just playing a game

268
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,770
I find blue feels more real and growing

269
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,180
up of course both sides matters though

270
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,649
there's a serious Russian gaining access

271
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:49,140
to a system designed to keep you out

272
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,450
is there a thrill in blue I prefer red

273
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,399
because I can't cope with being blue and

274
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,170
waiting for something to happen instead

275
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,000
of actively working on preventing it

276
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,800
before somebody else has the idea of

277
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,490
doing something stupid

278
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,339
red sounds insanely boring we all know

279
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:09,959
everything is vulnerable and given

280
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:11,459
enough time you will always find a way

281
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,589
in potentially by doing the same thing

282
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:14,850
over and over again

283
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,160
blue solves problems and hopefully

284
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,110
classes the problems instead of just

285
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,610
pointing at them red team is just in me

286
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:27,089
I'm also bad at building things and

287
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:28,860
quite good in the breaking department

288
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,550
sorry

289
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,140
straightforward blue is where I have the

290
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,029
highest leverage value for the business

291
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:38,970
I can work to eliminate entire classes

292
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,370
of blog bugs as blue wear red tends to

293
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,100
be constrained to finding one red also

294
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,480
usually lacks the authority and

295
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,790
positioning to drive fixes handing off

296
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,510
yet another report full of fun

297
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:54,400
that will be accepted without oh okay

298
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,530
what are what are they accepted without

299
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:04,180
oh no sorry I tried to get all cool with

300
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:09,540
the graphic said bring forward oh

301
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:16,060
computers man there it is accepted

302
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,490
without context isn't useful the Statue

303
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,440
of David could only have been created by

304
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,930
a handful of artists any three-year-old

305
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,140
with a hammer can destroy it I like

306
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:37,570
creating over destroyed so obviously

307
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,520
what I thought might be a somewhat

308
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,950
benign question evokes a lot of feelings

309
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,240
and a lot of opinions over one side is

310
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,940
right one side is wrong the other side's

311
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,000
boring I'm always this other side and so

312
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,160
to me I thought this was worth chatting

313
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,440
about because it did go along with a lot

314
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,900
of my experiences in InfoSec and even

315
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,840
sometimes my personal views of red

316
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,070
versus blue too and so I think that

317
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,950
maybe we don't need to have such strong

318
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,080
ties to the red or the blue side and I

319
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,240
don't know that it serves us to have

320
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,010
this much pride this much fundamental

321
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,480
dislike for wanting to work on the other

322
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,600
side of the coin and because what these

323
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,610
tweets were to show me is that there was

324
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,190
this fundamental cyclic simplification

325
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,170
of the other side an example is that

326
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,660
tweet that said blue just has to sit and

327
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,810
wait for things to that happen because a

328
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,820
lot of the blue teams I've seen they're

329
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,590
actually quite proactive and of course

330
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,960
they have to be reactive when something

331
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,480
happens I mean that's their job but

332
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,890
they're not just sitting around waiting

333
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:48,820
and what I've seen in terms of red is

334
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,120
red is often a very nuanced approach to

335
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,130
breaking and choosing what to break and

336
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,900
how to present those findings to

337
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,230
hopefully evoke change and so it's not

338
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,000
just that they like to break things

339
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,339
they'd just like to sit

340
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,499
and wait there's so much more nuance to

341
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:07,350
that and we don't necessarily have to

342
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,499
have this forced dichotomy of my sides

343
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:12,930
better my sides more fun my sides has

344
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,899
more impact because when it comes down

345
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,220
to it we're all in this for the same

346
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,230
goal we want to create a more secure

347
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,839
internet more secure enterprises so all

348
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,629
of our society that is using this crazy

349
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:29,990
amount of technology that is sort of

350
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,339
awesome but also being forced upon us

351
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,459
does not mean that we are in harm's way

352
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,550
and so I think by merging the red and

353
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,910
the blue a little bit more in

354
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,139
understanding each other and walking in

355
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,379
each other's shoes we can only push

356
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:49,819
forward this goal of securing everyone

357
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:53,699
more easily and thankfully there seems

358
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,860
to be some people on the thread who also

359
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,170
had this point of view and they shared

360
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,329
that they either worked on both sides

361
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:02,819
they had a lot of respect and liked both

362
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:05,520
sides and things like that so for

363
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,630
example protecting this person said they

364
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,309
liked both sides blue because they get

365
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:13,020
to protect people there's a mission

366
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,510
associated they don't like to kick bad

367
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,630
people's butts the red side there's this

368
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,779
curiosity anarchist tendencies and a

369
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:25,770
thrill of ponen another one said yes

370
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,599
they're more drawn to blue because the

371
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,610
results are more durable but they

372
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,110
acknowledge there's not really any quick

373
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:34,020
wins but they also know that none of

374
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,580
their work would happen without the

375
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,710
great minds on red who demonstrate to

376
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,020
them how something's broken and so that

377
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,080
they can fix it and there were a couple

378
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,500
people who on their own came up and

379
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,750
mentioned they see themselves as more

380
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,820
purple as well I prefer to dabble in

381
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,289
both sides of the force and then some

382
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:57,720
people also get the opportunity to split

383
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,200
between about 80% blue work 20% red and

384
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,760
it sounds like based on the raise of

385
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,679
hands some of y'all in this room are

386
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,679
lucky enough to do that as well and then

387
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,429
this one really seemed to evoke to me

388
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:14,730
what I felt as well of red is exciting

389
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,850
because you're looking at us

390
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,169
I'm trying to understand how it works

391
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:20,260
it's like a Rubik's Cube for the first

392
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,240
time it's fascinating it's exciting is

393
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,340
frustrating because you never really

394
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,230
know if you're close to being done or

395
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,539
not and blue is interesting because you

396
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:29,860
get to come up with ways to address

397
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,780
security gaps while balancing business

398
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,140
and usability needs but it's challenging

399
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,490
because it requires dealing with push

400
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,299
vests and s escalations but finally they

401
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:41,740
acknowledge both sides of pros and cons

402
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,530
and it's just unfortunate that some

403
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,210
folks claim one is better than the other

404
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,090
so I'm gonna take off through now

405
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,970
hopefully I have convinced you that I

406
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,250
think our community could use a little

407
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,470
more purple in their lives rather than

408
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,750
just red and blue and I want to show you

409
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,530
why I started out being very clearly on

410
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,390
one side of the bar but then I've seen

411
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,000
very practical benefits that I didn't

412
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,020
expect from switching back and forth

413
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,390
that kind of surprised me and have made

414
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,870
me a believer and the color purple too

415
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,929
so story time I was really lucky when I

416
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:26,380
was in undergraduate degree and CS that

417
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,360
I did get an offer right out of school

418
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,610
and it was to become a penetration

419
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,640
tester at a government research lab

420
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,890
write-up epic right up the coast at

421
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,679
Johns Hopkins Applied Physics lab and so

422
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,830
my first day on the job they gave me a

423
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,860
box and said we want you to see how you

424
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,230
can break this looking back it probably

425
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,150
should have had a little more structure

426
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,070
but it all turned out for the best and I

427
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,350
went started going through a lot of blog

428
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,520
posts of people I'm lucky enough to call

429
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,000
friends and somehow found my way to a

430
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,700
root shell funny story I didn't actually

431
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,070
realize that was the goal of doing the

432
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,520
penetration test and so I went to the

433
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,409
more senior engineer who was like my

434
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:13,330
point of contact at the time and I go

435
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,820
okay so I've done this thing I have a

436
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,909
linux shell what do I do next he goes

437
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:21,640
you have a little shell it was like yeah

438
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,280
you know this was a radio device and she

439
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,809
was like what user are you and I was

440
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:26,150
like

441
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,919
he was like type the who at my command

442
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,330
because I didn't even know that much and

443
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,130
so I was like Who am I

444
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,169
and it was like route he dose you're

445
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:35,539
done I was like oh did I do something

446
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:37,299
wrong

447
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:41,240
no you owed the box it was like oh and

448
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,529
he's like no you gotta write it up and

449
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:44,870
explain how you did it what you did and

450
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,059
what people can do better and that was

451
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:50,480
really hard but because I had found a

452
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,820
way to break the box but now I had to

453
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,590
see what comes of this how do we make it

454
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,980
better so I did about six months as a

455
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,649
pen tester and then they gave me asked

456
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:02,419
me if I was interested in taking part in

457
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:04,760
an adversary simulation where they

458
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,169
really needed me to be a reverse

459
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:08,659
engineer and I had never done a reverse

460
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:10,190
engineering before I didn't really know

461
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,600
what it was but they were like on your

462
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,820
resume you have all this computer

463
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,220
architecture experience I've been the TA

464
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,049
had helped everyone my favorite language

465
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:19,610
was assembly and so they were like

466
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:23,419
putting some pieces together here and so

467
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:26,419
in that case we were trying to emulate a

468
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:29,299
state-sponsored adversary spend six

469
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:31,640
months on this device to see if this

470
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,559
fault fell off the back of the truck

471
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:37,100
what could we learn from it and so we

472
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,100
spent all this time you know basically

473
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,679
reverse engineering every line a

474
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:45,230
firmware just seeing what can we find

475
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,590
what can we learn about this device how

476
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,260
could we attack it what information

477
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,960
would be lost and things like that and

478
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,440
then I also for the following four years

479
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,750
after that I was basically all reverse

480
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,659
engineering all the time because I

481
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:06,919
really do just love assembly but it also

482
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:09,020
got some offensive security research and

483
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,360
they're doing vulnerability research as

484
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,080
well as exploit dev and so at this time

485
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,590
in my life I was very solidly read I was

486
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,840
that person that was like read is fun

487
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,820
blue is boring you sit and wait and

488
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,929
after four and a half years of doing

489
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:32,720
this work Google called and I

490
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,820
they offered me a job to be a reverse

491
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,860
engineer on the Google Play protect team

492
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,350
which is doing the hunting malware on

493
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,920
all Android devices and I wasn't really

494
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,810
sure but also it was Google and I

495
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,130
figured I'd been doing the same thing

496
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,780
for four and a half years I was

497
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,530
comfortable I knew I knew like could

498
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,390
figure things out in this little niche

499
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,220
space I was working in so why not try

500
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,060
something else

501
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,820
so I packed everything up moved to the

502
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,370
west coast and for two years was working

503
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,830
as a malware analyst for Android

504
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,030
security dominantly in the off market

505
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,610
and the pre-installed spaces so that's

506
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,040
where the device and code auditor comes

507
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,060
in because I was going through all of

508
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,580
the Android OS devices prior to them

509
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,100
shipping with my team trying to see is

510
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,650
there a security vulnerability here is

511
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,350
our week going to is there malware is

512
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,850
there's some sort of issue that we need

513
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,280
to prevent before it launches to users

514
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,790
and in the off-market space we that

515
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,440
means everything that's not on Google

516
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,530
Play so in the u.s. North America in

517
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,690
Western Europe Google Play is how most

518
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,670
people on Android devices do get their

519
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,130
apps but for the rest of the world where

520
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,840
there's billions and billions of users

521
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,390
of Android devices they predominantly do

522
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,990
third-party app stores peer-to-peer

523
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:58,220
sideloading where you download it off of

524
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,520
a computer and then often use a USB to

525
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,560
load it onto your phone and so this was

526
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,010
a huge space of applications that we

527
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,600
were also trying to vet and find

528
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,330
anything that could harm users in and so

529
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,790
suddenly my reverse engineering skills

530
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:17,000
had to change drastically because I went

531
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,100
from reverse engineering one person

532
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,530
piece of firmware for six months to

533
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,240
needing to get through a hundred apps in

534
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,570
a day when I was on a queue and so at

535
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,470
first and to be quite honest I had

536
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,630
thought I would find moving to a malware

537
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,840
analysis position kind of boring I was

538
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,490
coming from this background of doing

539
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,030
hardware and firmware exploitation which

540
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,890
I thought was cool because you see all

541
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:43,790
these things

542
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,520
the world - moving up to Java apps and

543
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,000
in my you know sort of one-track mind

544
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,750
brain I just didn't get how I would find

545
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,450
the challenge and fun but then I started

546
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,610
tackling large-scale investigations

547
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,460
working to protect users and there was

548
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,530
this day earlier in February where I was

549
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,660
leading an investigation in what we

550
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,640
named the chinois botnet which I've

551
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,100
talked about elsewhere before which at

552
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,870
one point infected 20 million users

553
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,630
around the world and was growing really

554
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,710
really quickly

555
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,690
we saw droppers trying to get to

556
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,750
hundreds of millions of devices and so I

557
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,580
guess February 28th 2019 I put in a

558
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,350
solution that was going to protect and

559
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,530
block on all 20 million devices where it

560
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,470
currently was but also prevent it from

561
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:37,180
being able to affect other users and

562
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,770
suddenly that high that you get from

563
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,170
ponying a box didn't even compare to

564
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,620
that feeling of knowing within 72 hours

565
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,330
2.5 billion devices we're going to check

566
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,180
in and get that protection so my mind

567
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,290
started to change a little bit then in

568
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,680
July of this year after about two years

569
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,350
I switch teams within Google to Google

570
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,360
Project zero if you don't know what the

571
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,580
project's your team is it's we're about

572
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,870
15 security researchers who are our goal

573
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,920
is to make zero-day hard a zero-day is a

574
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,460
vulnerability that defenders don't know

575
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,470
about so really only attackers have

576
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,330
found this vulnerability and are trying

577
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,970
to exploit it and these zero day

578
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,560
exploits that use zero day

579
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,740
vulnerabilities are especially difficult

580
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,050
to prevent and detect and fight against

581
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:33,440
because the defenders don't know about

582
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,240
them you don't know you need a patch you

583
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,820
don't know this hole exists and so our

584
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,810
team sort of mo for the last five years

585
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,240
has been to hire security researchers to

586
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,160
try and find zero-day vulnerabilities in

587
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,890
the same client devices that the bad

588
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:52,190
actors are so I phones Android windows

589
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,360
things like that

590
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,220
and the goal is to have bug collisions

591
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,679
which means we're finding the same bugs

592
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,500
as the bad actors are but we reach out

593
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,390
to the vendor behind the device to get

594
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,820
it patched within 90 days and delivered

595
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,870
to users but when I enjoin project zero

596
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,700
I was joining to start a new role for

597
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,220
them whereas the conventional project

598
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,410
zero work has been pretty read in

599
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,059
general you know it's that Volant pretty

600
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:20,660
pure vulnerability research I was going

601
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,790
to be doing a hybrid vulnerability

602
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,100
research and threat Intel and so now I'm

603
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,190
in this new more purple position because

604
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,040
some of the goals of this hybrid is that

605
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,470
I'm going I am studying zero-day

606
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,500
exploits use in the wild in order to

607
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,280
glean how can we better find other

608
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,740
zero-days make it harder for them to use

609
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,169
new zero-days in a while and things like

610
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:47,870
that so an example of that is is when a

611
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,809
zero-day exploit is used in the wild do

612
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:54,049
the root cause analysis not just the

613
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:57,350
basic okay we think it's this bug is

614
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,750
should say use after three probably in

615
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,580
this driver and it's going to get

616
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,150
patched really go down into how exactly

617
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:09,919
did this bug work and how can we what

618
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,540
can we learn from how they likely found

619
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,549
it and things like that and so that's a

620
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:15,530
very blue action because it's sort of

621
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,820
like malware analysis where you're

622
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,990
looking and then looking back at what

623
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,030
attackers did but then using that in

624
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,309
terms of red team to inform where should

625
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:27,980
I go in hunt for bugs so for example

626
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,080
when you are a vulnerability researcher

627
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,580
you often find more than one bug at a

628
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,460
time because the developers are usually

629
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,380
using a pattern that they have written

630
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:41,780
more than once at a time but when you

631
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,270
know bad actors find that bug or find

632
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,220
those bugs they only need to use one in

633
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,130
their exploit so our goal is to or

634
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,809
Michael is after I've done that root

635
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:54,320
cause analysis do you then use that to

636
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,480
inform variant analysis and hopefully

637
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,220
burn the rest of the bugs that those

638
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,059
attackers

639
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:01,700
have in their cache and so that's sort

640
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,860
of an example of purple of now using

641
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,499
these reverse engineering analysis

642
00:29:05,499 --> 00:29:09,169
skills in both the offensive and

643
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:10,820
defensive ways to hopefully make

644
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:15,379
zero-day hard so I've switched a couple

645
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,539
different times I told you I didn't

646
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:19,610
really want to switch necessarily all

647
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,700
the time wasn't feeling drawn to it but

648
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,509
I've seen some really exact and somewhat

649
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:29,690
surprising benefits to myself my career

650
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:33,080
my team that hopefully might help you as

651
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,619
well

652
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:36,230
so how did red experience help me be a

653
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:39,619
better blue team err so while I was on

654
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:42,379
the Google Play for tech team I said we

655
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:43,970
worked on queues and this was in our

656
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,129
pre-installed apps queues so Android has

657
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:51,110
about eleven hundred different OEMs so

658
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:57,009
om meaning like Samsung Google wall way

659
00:29:57,009 --> 00:30:01,100
bebe cool cool mobile you know all these

660
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,460
different OEMs that predominantly are

661
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,809
selling phones and regions other than us

662
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:08,149
and so that means we have a lot of apps

663
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:10,610
to get through and bet when the

664
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:13,580
automated systems say hey this needs a

665
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,019
human review because I can't decide if

666
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:16,970
it's good or bad and oh yeah there's

667
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,330
also a 24 hour time limit on this for us

668
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,869
to give back our feedback and so this

669
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:26,450
app came into my cue it looks like your

670
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,649
run-of-the-mill Diagnostics application

671
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:33,350
yet I couldn't let it go to me I just

672
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,570
kept saying I think something is wrong

673
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,509
with this my gut is telling me there's

674
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:42,499
an issue here and I couldn't put it back

675
00:30:42,499 --> 00:30:44,720
to work and my teammates as well as my

676
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,549
manager kept saying mani it's a

677
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:49,820
Diagnostics app we we don't have to like

678
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,369
them but it's not it doesn't break any

679
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:55,129
of the exact rules because we see at the

680
00:30:55,129 --> 00:30:58,070
top this application was connecting to a

681
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,080
socket and it was receiving information

682
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,629
and it was writing it to a log and so

683
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:05,149
we're usually only supposed to spend

684
00:31:05,149 --> 00:31:08,480
about five to ten minutes on an app yet

685
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,029
I could didn't feel that I could fly

686
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:12,890
this as a false positive

687
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,559
something still felt off even if I could

688
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:19,370
not burp verbalize consciously what it

689
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:22,490
was about it so after looking way way

690
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:26,480
too long and not listening to my manager

691
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,779
in my teammates I found this method that

692
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:32,450
was called proc GM string and what it

693
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,950
was doing is it was taking all the

694
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,340
commands that it received from the

695
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,500
remote socket and writing them to a file

696
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,500
a file that is in the apps private

697
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,590
directory under the cache and that

698
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,899
seemed weird because I didn't really see

699
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:50,149
other things within this app that was

700
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:52,460
using that information so why would they

701
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,970
just be writing commands to a file and

702
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,789
not be doing anything so at this point

703
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:01,429
I'd spent most of the day on it and my

704
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:03,380
manager was like you still haven't got

705
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,760
anything you need to let this go and

706
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,580
move on to the next app so instead I

707
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,230
stayed up all night because I still

708
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,110
couldn't tell them why but something

709
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:17,269
just felt so wrong and finally I think

710
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,799
it was like midnight or something I

711
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,580
found the first time I found this daemon

712
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,220
number 1 which is a binary running on

713
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,220
the firmware image of the phone that was

714
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,710
reading and monitoring that text file in

715
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,380
the apps private cache directory and

716
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,659
this was interesting and res raised red

717
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:40,070
flags because files that are in an Apps

718
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,380
private directory are supposed to be

719
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,289
sandbox there it's not usual for them to

720
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:50,950
be read written modified by outside

721
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:54,500
components within the device and so this

722
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,179
was a little flag I needed to keep going

723
00:32:56,179 --> 00:32:58,580
drink more coffee stamp and keep

724
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,039
figuring this out because I've gotten

725
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,070
another hint and then I what I found is

726
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,470
that I put together all the pieces of

727
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,559
this arbitrary remote code execution

728
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,630
backdoor and so the way the backdoor

729
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,450
worked is that we had this pre-installed

730
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,070
app that communicated with the remote

731
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,669
socket it would write to that text file

732
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:22,159
any of the commands that remiel received

733
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:22,980
from the room

734
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,100
socket daemon number one would then read

735
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,620
all the commands from the text file in

736
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,480
the app directory and write them to a

737
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,110
kernel character device that kernel

738
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,880
character in device was then monitored

739
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,010
by a second binary daemon on the device

740
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:41,840
which looked for any commands that were

741
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,320
between the tags exs H if that command

742
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,889
was whatever text was in between those

743
00:33:49,889 --> 00:33:51,720
two tags it would pass directly to

744
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,659
system system is a Linux call which

745
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:58,289
means execute this directly and so then

746
00:33:58,289 --> 00:33:59,970
you have an arbitrary remote code

747
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,010
execution back door where a remote

748
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:05,309
entity can cause any commands they want

749
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,799
to be run on this device and to add

750
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,469
insult to injury they had modified the

751
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:12,570
SELinux policy that was running on the

752
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:16,349
device to give daemon number two extra

753
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:19,290
privileges so it basically was as close

754
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:24,859
as to route as you can get on Android so

755
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:28,469
looking back we all sort of wondered

756
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:32,819
what was it that made me not let this go

757
00:34:32,819 --> 00:34:35,639
and not be willing to say okay I've

758
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:39,210
looked I can't find anything just go and

759
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,300
I think it's easy at least for me a lot

760
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,760
of the times to say oh it was just my

761
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,869
intuition it was just my gut I was lucky

762
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:52,918
but what it turns out is funny situation

763
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:54,619
the more work I did the luckier I got

764
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:58,349
and when we tried to dive into this even

765
00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:01,050
more of why did I find this when the

766
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,420
rest of our malware analysis team looked

767
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,819
at it as at the same time I was in

768
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:08,460
saying no it's fine is just a diagnostic

769
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,619
app and then we finally got down to it

770
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,599
thanks to a senior mentor who kept

771
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,400
pushing me and pushing me to say more

772
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,210
than it's my gut is that I've written

773
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,240
backdoors before in terms of adversary

774
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,060
simulation exercises and the way I had

775
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,420
actually done it twice was put it in

776
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,099
administrative code and in nine gnostics

777
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:32,490
code and I had also broken it up into

778
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,440
different chunks never putting all of

779
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,110
the code to

780
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,990
gather in one place and so even if I

781
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:41,170
consciously was not able to say oh yeah

782
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,120
this looks like a back door that I would

783
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,210
have written your intuition your gut

784
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,040
grows from all of those different

785
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,070
experiences and so it can tell you that

786
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,410
something looks off even before you

787
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,990
consciously say this is exactly the red

788
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,820
flag and why I think we need to do more

789
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,530
work here and so by doing a diversity a

790
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,990
diverse type of work that I'm gaining in

791
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:08,140
diverse type of experiences we teach our

792
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,630
gut we teach our intuition to find more

793
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:17,470
of what helps us recognize the bad in a

794
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:19,900
sea of false positives and when you're

795
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,270
on the loo team and have so many samples

796
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,640
so many signals so many different things

797
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,770
that you're trying to filter out and

798
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:31,620
sort that can come in extremely handy

799
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,530
the other thing I found that really

800
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,360
really helped me in terms of blue team

801
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,360
is that by starting in red where I'm

802
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,390
used to reverse engineering things for

803
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,240
long periods of time used to having a

804
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,160
lot of failed bugs that turned out to

805
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,590
not be exploitable looking for

806
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,420
vulnerabilities or bugs that did not

807
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,170
actually exist it grows a different type

808
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,710
of persistence than pure blue team does

809
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,630
because you're used to the failure after

810
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,780
failure after failure of not finding the

811
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,660
way in and continuing to stay until you

812
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,950
find it or find a way in that I think

813
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,320
helps inform that blue of even though I

814
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,590
were supposed to stop working after five

815
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,840
minutes of looking at the app I just

816
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,180
knew it had to be there and so I kept

817
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:27,730
with it for much longer so that's just

818
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,700
to practical examples of how I've seen

819
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,480
red experience help me be a better

820
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,880
malware analysis Blue team err but then

821
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,960
I I definitely found some skills through

822
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,580
blue side work that have

823
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,770
that I wished I would have had in red

824
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,540
and have already helped me in this new

825
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,180
purple role on the red sides of that so

826
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,710
first you have to be so efficient to be

827
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:57,290
to work well on blue because as we say

828
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:59,720
there is so much you're trying to sort

829
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,320
through to find those few nuggets of

830
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,480
badness to block that you don't have

831
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,460
enough people most of the time and so

832
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,550
you have to prioritize and in particular

833
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:14,540
my scripting and tooling capabilities

834
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,270
got so much better when I was working as

835
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,100
a malware analyst versus as a

836
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,350
vulnerability researcher and the reason

837
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,690
because I saw a lot of samples that were

838
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,970
packed for example meaning they were

839
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,310
obfuscated you couldn't clearly see what

840
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:31,340
the code was doing and so you have to

841
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,320
make that decision of how do I quickly

842
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,260
get this unpacked so that I can decide

843
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,580
whether or not this sample is bad and

844
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,590
whereas previous to joining blue my goal

845
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,840
was always to understand how that

846
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,520
packing mechanism our obfuscation

847
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,500
mechanism work that I'm reverse

848
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,140
engineering to understand and then I can

849
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,690
write my tooling solution what I found

850
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,630
in malware analysis is that I don't

851
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,910
actually have to always understand how

852
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,980
the Packer works how the obfuscator

853
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,530
works I just need a solution to one

854
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,930
packet and so what that meant in terms

855
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:08,240
of scripting which I often did I had a

856
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,550
Python scripting where Ida Pro is the

857
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,110
most commonly used is assembler for

858
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,480
reverse engineering is I did translation

859
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,330
rather than understanding and writing a

860
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:20,060
new solution so I would just translate

861
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,330
their code where their D obfuscating

862
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:26,990
around packing into a tool that I was

863
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,270
going to run on the sample so that I

864
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,340
didn't have to understand what the

865
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,200
algorithm was were they using this

866
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,050
version of encryption I just needed to

867
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,150
get something else to run it on there

868
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:42,980
and so I've now even seen that in my bug

869
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,060
hunting work for a project zero of

870
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,500
really taking that deliberate choice of

871
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,990
do I need to understand all this code or

872
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,150
do I just need something to accomplish

873
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,950
the goal

874
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,349
and I've also found that I'm a much

875
00:39:57,349 --> 00:40:01,160
quicker at setting up environment for

876
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,070
tooling because I'm not setting it up

877
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,369
necessarily for a long-term engagement

878
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:09,980
or exercise I just need something that

879
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:15,140
will solve the problem now another

880
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:18,080
example is attack surface selection so I

881
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,660
think this might be one of the most

882
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,369
obvious benefits you could see from blue

883
00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:24,020
to red I think everyone in this room

884
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,200
would guess that when you switch between

885
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,300
blue or red if you're going from blue to

886
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,030
red it's helpful because you learn how

887
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,890
people are trying to attack whatever

888
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,270
you're defending so you get better at

889
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:37,250
defending against those attacks and the

890
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,790
opposite is true too if you know how

891
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,560
defenders are defending it gets easier

892
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,240
to attack but at a more specific level

893
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,859
when I was working in blue for the

894
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:52,670
Android security team I got a much

895
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,890
larger and broader knowledge about the

896
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:58,040
whole attack surface because I was not

897
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,920
no longer just trying to attack this one

898
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,960
driver for example running on the phone

899
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,480
I was responsible for defending the

900
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,970
whole device so I had to understand then

901
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:11,089
how does that driver interact with the

902
00:41:11,089 --> 00:41:14,720
SELinux policies what dak isn't running

903
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,060
under and things like that and so that

904
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,910
helped me then understand at a larger

905
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,430
scale where our holes I might not have

906
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:25,220
concern previously because I was focused

907
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,099
on attacking this one piece but it also

908
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:29,530
helps in terms of understanding

909
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:33,349
priorities so if you are a red team or

910
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:35,900
if you are in a penetration test or an

911
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,570
exercise and you're a red team you need

912
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,520
to make decisions on what goals are you

913
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,530
trying to help accomplish and so

914
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,930
understanding the choices that the blue

915
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:47,270
team has to make especially in terms of

916
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:49,820
priorities where are we prioritizing our

917
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,190
defenses that can help you make your

918
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:55,099
choices of what to attack because in

919
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:57,500
some cases you may choose I want to

920
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,480
attack the same thing that blue team is

921
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,809
choosing to prioritize in terms of

922
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:04,420
Pence's because then I'm really testing

923
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,329
what they believe is most important and

924
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:09,269
they're putting all their resources into

925
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:11,529
but at the same time you might choose

926
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,589
the exact opposite choice as well

927
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:16,749
because you may say I disagree with your

928
00:42:16,749 --> 00:42:18,819
choice to put all your resources into

929
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:20,949
this one section to defend against I

930
00:42:20,949 --> 00:42:22,719
don't think you are prioritizing

931
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:24,699
correctly and I'm gonna show you why

932
00:42:24,699 --> 00:42:27,130
with practical results but then you can

933
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,559
take up to these X in order to get more

934
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:33,039
resources for so there were two cases

935
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,130
that already on project zero I've seen a

936
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,349
tech surface understanding to help me

937
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:41,049
his first we did a bunk bash against an

938
00:42:41,049 --> 00:42:45,339
a specific Android device and we were

939
00:42:45,339 --> 00:42:48,160
doing this super quick about 48 hours of

940
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,140
work to see what as a team could be

941
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,189
fined and I chose to focus all of my

942
00:42:54,189 --> 00:42:57,459
analysis work in my bug bashing against

943
00:42:57,459 --> 00:43:00,039
the areas that I knew had been so tough

944
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:02,589
to defend against on the other side as a

945
00:43:02,589 --> 00:43:05,199
malware analyst where I was like these

946
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:07,509
gaps exists and fundamentally there's

947
00:43:07,509 --> 00:43:09,549
not a good way to close them right now

948
00:43:09,549 --> 00:43:13,630
and so that was super helpful in helping

949
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:16,689
me quickly dive into this 48-hour bug

950
00:43:16,689 --> 00:43:18,609
bash to start trying to find things on

951
00:43:18,609 --> 00:43:20,109
this device I hadn't looked at before

952
00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:25,599
and another example was I recently

953
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,119
released the public bug in Android

954
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:30,189
binder driver that was a zero-day being

955
00:43:30,189 --> 00:43:33,279
used in the wild and what it was doing

956
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:35,079
is in the binder driver which is a

957
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,809
pretty integral component to binder does

958
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:41,229
the inter-process communication there

959
00:43:41,229 --> 00:43:45,839
was a a wait queue object for polling

960
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,579
was not tied to the lifetime of the file

961
00:43:48,579 --> 00:43:50,739
that it was monitoring and this allowed

962
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:52,539
for a use after free which then could be

963
00:43:52,539 --> 00:43:54,489
was able to be used for a kernel

964
00:43:54,489 --> 00:43:58,839
privilege escalation and we found it in

965
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:00,579
this one place the attackers who are

966
00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:02,709
using the zero day in the wild also

967
00:44:02,709 --> 00:44:06,429
found it in that place and I wanted to

968
00:44:06,429 --> 00:44:08,229
do variant analysis because this seemed

969
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:12,189
like a pretty easy to do mistake in

970
00:44:12,189 --> 00:44:13,430
terms of a develop

971
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:16,940
of not tying the wait queue for pulling

972
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,120
along with the file handler and so I

973
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,120
went through the Linux kernel and I

974
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,980
wanted to find every place that they

975
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,520
used pole weight function turns out that

976
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,960
was two hundred and thirty six different

977
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,100
places that they had pull weight and I

978
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,990
needed to figure out how do I filter and

979
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:38,300
vet these because that is a lot of

980
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,880
tedious work time whether you're on red

981
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,980
blue or purple is usually the most

982
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,880
important resource you have and so what

983
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,490
I did was that I focused and tried to do

984
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:51,380
it in the same way that I looked for

985
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,770
malware variants what is the piece that

986
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:58,160
matters that was the pole way and then

987
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,570
how what type of signals would make this

988
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:07,820
more likely to be occurring as a actual

989
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:12,140
bug verse is the benign not a bug usage

990
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,320
of it and so that came down to looking

991
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,900
at who had submitted the change for the

992
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,940
original bug and finder did that person

993
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,820
submit any of these other changes what

994
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,400
type of drivers were these pol Lisa were

995
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,290
they similar to binder where they have

996
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:29,330
their pretty privileged not super

997
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:32,390
sandbox or were they a very specific use

998
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:34,070
case that maybe one device in the world

999
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:37,370
used and so this really helped me use

1000
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:39,560
those malware analysis skills of you

1001
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,300
have so many examples how do you filter

1002
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,210
down the sample size to this red skill

1003
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:48,380
set of looking for vulnerabilities the

1004
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,870
last two that I have seen drastic

1005
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,180
improvements from in terms of blue side

1006
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:57,770
of being red and learning from blue was

1007
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:59,870
communication and this was kind of

1008
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:01,190
surprising to me because I thought of

1009
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:02,690
myself as a good communicator while I

1010
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,420
was on ret to but in terms of red I

1011
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,850
often just had to stick to the technical

1012
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:11,030
how do I explain to you what I did and

1013
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:14,180
then you off they then the blue team

1014
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,559
with the one who has any choices

1015
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:18,109
defenses stuff like that based on the

1016
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:21,380
information I gave them on blew my

1017
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,349
timelines were often shrunk much quicker

1018
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:25,789
than the report writing and

1019
00:46:25,789 --> 00:46:28,369
communication skills in red and I also

1020
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,440
needed to persuade execs

1021
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,900
who have a lot of other concerns besides

1022
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,690
just security to make the choices I

1023
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:37,730
wanted so my communication skills

1024
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:40,400
something I had to portray these

1025
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,770
technical details to a non-technical

1026
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:45,740
audience while persuading them that this

1027
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,510
is important and I want you to take this

1028
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,910
action and so I found that I became much

1029
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:52,250
more concise much more quicker in my

1030
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,400
writing and really focusing on the

1031
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,380
important parts for that in also in

1032
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,020
interpersonal communication a lot of the

1033
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,849
people you're working with in the middle

1034
00:47:01,849 --> 00:47:05,660
of an incident or an intrusion they have

1035
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,910
a lot of other things going on too so

1036
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:09,859
how in those oral communication can you

1037
00:47:09,859 --> 00:47:13,430
communicate what they need to know and

1038
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,619
decide what they need to know quickly

1039
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:19,849
and effectively and lastly is teamwork I

1040
00:47:19,849 --> 00:47:22,010
didn't realize it at the time but

1041
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:23,809
looking back now it was obvious is that

1042
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:27,349
read is often a very solo activity even

1043
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:29,059
when you're working as a team you're

1044
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:31,910
often working on one specific part

1045
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:34,369
yourself and then maybe you're the

1046
00:47:34,369 --> 00:47:36,260
reverse engineer looking at this driver

1047
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,240
they're looking at network you have

1048
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,529
someone else looking at social

1049
00:47:39,529 --> 00:47:43,099
engineering so yes you're on a team but

1050
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:45,170
you're often one-to-one on the computer

1051
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:45,920
by yourself

1052
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,770
whereas blue you're often having to

1053
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:51,190
coordinate with so many other people

1054
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:53,720
you're trying to coordinate with your

1055
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,369
direct team members who might be doing

1056
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:58,520
the same role to prioritize slice up

1057
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,430
share delegate that whole sample size

1058
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:03,289
you're trying to vet you're trying to

1059
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:06,020
interact with program managers project

1060
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:09,980
managers execs who need to to understand

1061
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,250
your technical expertise to make choices

1062
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,450
you're needing to work with for example

1063
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:17,420
incident commanders or the software

1064
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:18,589
engineers who are building those

1065
00:48:18,589 --> 00:48:20,900
defenses that you believe should happen

1066
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:24,289
and so my team work skills delegation

1067
00:48:24,289 --> 00:48:25,740
things like that have deaf

1068
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:28,440
grown from being on blue as well and

1069
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,030
what was cool is I also saw this

1070
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,970
reflected in the Twitter thread that I

1071
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:35,910
mentioned earlier of some people really

1072
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:37,440
like blue because of the teamwork

1073
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,089
aspects that they've noticed in

1074
00:48:39,089 --> 00:48:41,430
comparison to red and so I think that's

1075
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:44,780
just a really cool hopeful vibe as well

1076
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:47,570
but overarching what I learned from blue

1077
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:49,950
was tactically I learned how to work

1078
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:52,200
smarter not harder you're never going to

1079
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,780
be able to find every single hole that

1080
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,730
exists in blue every single way to get

1081
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:59,280
in there whereas red you're often only

1082
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,920
having to look for one to get in and so

1083
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,480
you have to become that much more

1084
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,839
efficient smarter work with other people

1085
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:09,510
to collaborate and so I think that's the

1086
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:11,790
biggest thing I have brought in now into

1087
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:16,070
my purple red actions is how to works

1088
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:20,580
intelligently so I've shared some

1089
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,520
reasons and the benefits for me that I

1090
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,480
have seen from switching it up but I

1091
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,070
think it'll smell it comes down to is

1092
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:31,440
whatever side of security you want to

1093
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,599
work on and I think it's totally fine to

1094
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,540
have a side you're drawn to more I mean

1095
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,450
I still do I think it makes us all

1096
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:41,490
better and when each of us as

1097
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:43,380
individuals are better at whatever

1098
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,530
security we do that makes all of our

1099
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:48,990
teams and our whole infrastructure as

1100
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:51,030
you know technologists working to help

1101
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,580
secure people it makes it stronger more

1102
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:58,349
secure and things like that but now what

1103
00:49:58,349 --> 00:50:00,599
hopefully if somewhat commenced you who

1104
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:03,450
those of you who felt pretty strongly on

1105
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,760
one side of the other that you should

1106
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,210
switch it up but how might you do that

1107
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:12,810
so first from an individual level it's

1108
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:13,410
hard

1109
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,170
I wouldn't recommend necessarily any of

1110
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:18,030
us quit our jobs and say I'm looking for

1111
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:20,550
a job on the other side but I think that

1112
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,369
we can still find opportunities to work

1113
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:25,470
on the other side whatever you may

1114
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:27,830
consider that for you so whether that's

1115
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:30,570
partnering up or if you are trying or

1116
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:33,330
partnering up with a team that maybe

1117
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:36,240
they have a rotation opportunity or an

1118
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,740
opportunity for you to jump in on a

1119
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:38,760
single project

1120
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,720
or if you are you know looking for a job

1121
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,260
being willing to consider those on say

1122
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,850
the blue side if you've always been red

1123
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:49,770
or on the red if you have always been

1124
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:52,260
blue even if that's not what you think

1125
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,060
you're especially good at or have the

1126
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:56,700
experience and yet I also think it's

1127
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,340
important to regularly meet and have

1128
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,220
lunch with or chat with folks on that

1129
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,740
work on the other side of you and I

1130
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,500
think one of the biggest things I get

1131
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,570
out of these chats is asking them what

1132
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:11,790
their challenges are in understanding

1133
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:14,910
why what they do is hard and that helps

1134
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:16,800
give us a little more empathy and

1135
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,130
understanding for the other side as well

1136
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:22,410
but I also love to ask what are you

1137
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:24,359
doing that you think it's cool because

1138
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:26,310
that really can show you these cool

1139
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:28,230
things that it's not just blue it's not

1140
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:30,900
just red there are these other nuances

1141
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,430
and challenges that they have to put

1142
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:34,320
into their work and the choices that

1143
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:39,150
they make and I think all of our goal

1144
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:41,160
can be just to become a little more

1145
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,200
purple in general than our work in our

1146
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,000
considerations of how we go about

1147
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,140
whatever our roles are but at the

1148
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:52,230
individual level that's fine but there

1149
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:55,770
are some industry blockers that make

1150
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:58,200
this hard for each of us to make those

1151
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,900
switches I mean as much as they say that

1152
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,960
there is these this huge amount of open

1153
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,869
roles in InfoSec you only have to go on

1154
00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:08,190
Twitter for a few minutes to realize

1155
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:10,590
that people are really struggling though

1156
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:12,780
to find all these so-called open roles

1157
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,880
and that there is a lot of gatekeeping

1158
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,470
there are a lot of experience

1159
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:18,600
requirements that make it hard to make

1160
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,240
those changes or try something new so I

1161
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,790
think one thing we can push is to do

1162
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:27,150
more rotation programs in our industries

1163
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:29,820
whether it's a few months six months a

1164
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:32,160
year to allow people to try something

1165
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,350
new where they always have the option to

1166
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,750
go back that was one of the things for

1167
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:39,000
me about trying the blued role with

1168
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,970
Google is that I knew I can always go

1169
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:46,100
back to my job I had this safety net at

1170
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,490
JHU APL and that I could have found more

1171
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:51,630
work in

1172
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,400
exploit davin firmware and embedded

1173
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,380
devices if I really didn't like what I

1174
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,900
was doing so let's build that out for

1175
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,989
everyone have that opportunity

1176
00:52:59,989 --> 00:53:02,130
we also need to change experience

1177
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:05,219
requirements I understand that I have

1178
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:09,029
had very privileged experience in terms

1179
00:53:09,029 --> 00:53:11,249
of the job hunting market is that I've

1180
00:53:11,249 --> 00:53:12,930
had a lot of people take chances on me

1181
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:14,309
when I hadn't proven myself an

1182
00:53:14,309 --> 00:53:16,019
experience but I don't think that should

1183
00:53:16,019 --> 00:53:18,539
be just me because I think if someone

1184
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:21,239
has the basic technical skills so for

1185
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,680
example in my case that was reverse

1186
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,769
engineering it's not that hard of a

1187
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,569
switch to go from doing it for

1188
00:53:27,569 --> 00:53:30,269
vulnerability research to malware

1189
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:33,390
analysis I didn't there was no way for

1190
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:35,969
me to get malware analysis experience

1191
00:53:35,969 --> 00:53:37,589
unless someone gave me that opportunity

1192
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:40,170
and took that chance and I think that

1193
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:41,880
should be the case for everyone if

1194
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,640
someone has the basic technical

1195
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,199
expertise then trust that they're

1196
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:48,329
probably confident enough to make the

1197
00:53:48,329 --> 00:53:50,190
switch between red and blue and apply it

1198
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:53,670
in a new way I think we also need to be

1199
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,890
assuming training and ramp up period in

1200
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,989
each of our jobs why would we assume

1201
00:53:57,989 --> 00:54:00,449
that someone can come in and do your

1202
00:54:00,449 --> 00:54:03,239
exact work on your tool set with no ramp

1203
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:05,759
up period so that allows us to be more

1204
00:54:05,759 --> 00:54:07,769
flexible in our our experience in

1205
00:54:07,769 --> 00:54:10,559
training and also gives makes likely a

1206
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,019
better workforce because you're giving

1207
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:14,789
them the option opportunity to

1208
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:17,459
experience to experiment to fail and to

1209
00:54:17,459 --> 00:54:22,140
gain broader experiences I am a

1210
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,209
specialist like I will acknowledge that

1211
00:54:24,209 --> 00:54:26,219
I just do reverse engineering all the

1212
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:28,650
time but I think it's good to push

1213
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,199
ourselves to be more generalist and even

1214
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:33,599
those niche fields like trying malware

1215
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,369
analysis vulnerability research bug

1216
00:54:35,369 --> 00:54:39,059
hunting threat Intel across and again I

1217
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:43,109
just say more purple and Industry

1218
00:54:43,109 --> 00:54:46,949
changes are hard I know I can sometimes

1219
00:54:46,949 --> 00:54:48,869
fall into the trap of being like but I'm

1220
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,569
not the CEO I'm not even a manager

1221
00:54:51,569 --> 00:54:54,719
anymore what can I do but I think we

1222
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,630
sometimes discount the amount of power

1223
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:00,449
that we each have as individual

1224
00:55:00,449 --> 00:55:02,999
contributors on a team - you know if you

1225
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:04,190
look around in your leg

1226
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:08,450
I might not have the title but I know

1227
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:10,549
they all respect my technical expertise

1228
00:55:10,549 --> 00:55:12,829
what I bring to this team and by doing

1229
00:55:12,829 --> 00:55:14,930
that and taking advantage we can then

1230
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:17,780
push our managers our leaders or even

1231
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,849
just do it ourselves and say hey I'm

1232
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:22,369
gonna take on this mentee for you know

1233
00:55:22,369 --> 00:55:24,200
that this next quarter they're gonna

1234
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,319
work with me on a project depending on

1235
00:55:27,319 --> 00:55:29,599
where you work they may say no if you

1236
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,750
have like you know tight requirements in

1237
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:35,030
terms of info sharing but I think most

1238
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,470
of the people I know in most the place

1239
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:38,900
they work are like cool okay don't let

1240
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,200
it disrupt your current workload but

1241
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,420
that now allows you to help share

1242
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,280
information with others and help make

1243
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,920
these industry changes and also if you

1244
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,289
are even you know a lower lip level

1245
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:55,430
middle manager then you can also set

1246
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:57,349
what the requirements are for the people

1247
00:55:57,349 --> 00:56:00,140
you hire on your team and be willing to

1248
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,660
take a little more risks because often

1249
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,839
people show up do the work and will

1250
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:10,369
surprise you and with that thank you I

1251
00:56:10,369 --> 00:56:12,799
appreciate y'all y'all come sitting here

1252
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,960
for 60 minutes early on a Saturday

1253
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,559
morning and thank you again the V sites

1254
00:56:17,559 --> 00:56:19,760
Charleston crew for having me

1255
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,680
and I think we have like one minute for

1256
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,599
questions if there are any oh no

1257
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,789
questions I'll be walking around so come

1258
00:56:25,789 --> 00:56:27,690
fine thank y'all

1259
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:31,489
[Applause]
