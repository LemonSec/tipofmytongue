1
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,180
hi everybody so today we're gonna be

2
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,460
talking about the top 5 ways I own your

3
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,030
internal network my name is Heath Adams

4
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,660
quick Who am I so I am a husband got my

5
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,270
wife here with me hacker veteran gamer

6
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,500
sports fan and animal dad I am a former

7
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,239
accountant turned cybersecurity geek so

8
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,410
wasn't accountant hated it and then

9
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,449
decided that it's gonna become a

10
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:58,449
penetration tester so here I am on the

11
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:00,129
day-to-day I am a senior security

12
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:02,800
engineer and a business owner at TCM

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,349
security and I run two projects so

14
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:07,360
project one is called veteran SEC or vet

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,880
SEC that is a non-profit so if anybody

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,040
in here is a military veteran or even in

17
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,300
the military

18
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,420
basically it is a slack channel that

19
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,040
there's closing in on thousand members

20
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,590
now so it's just a place to network with

21
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,520
other people who are in the same

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,500
position interested in cyber security

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,580
you know there's old hats in there that

24
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,229
work in the field or people still trying

25
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:28,180
to get in the field people transitioning

26
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,460
out as well so it's good good resource

27
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,460
for military veterans the other project

28
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,899
that I run is called the cyber mentor so

29
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:37,630
that's my youtube / twitch personality

30
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,240
so if you're interested in becoming a

31
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,320
penetration tester there's a lot of

32
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,109
videos on that a lot of how-to guides

33
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:46,780
and a lot of advice there so we do

34
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,399
weekly streams usually on Twitch and

35
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,990
most of my content gets uploaded to

36
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,390
YouTube so you can check me out twitch

37
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,789
YouTube Twitter at the cyber mentor and

38
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:57,130
then the blogs I write for veterans a

39
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,829
calm and then visits website of TCM tech

40
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:05,109
comm so why this talk so there's three

41
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:06,280
reasons

42
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,080
there's offensive side of things which

43
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,639
is you know how can we leverage these

44
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,620
and tasks inside of a network and the

45
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,090
defensive side is how can we defend

46
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,220
against those and the overall big thing

47
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,020
is awareness so if you're not on offense

48
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,940
you're not on defense at least knowing

49
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,320
about these even in your personal life

50
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,570
some of these tips in this talk and can

51
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,990
really help you out so with that being

52
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,319
said

53
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,840
so we're saying internal that means

54
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,850
inside of the network so there's usually

55
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,530
two types of network penetration test

56
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,630
ones a external that's kind of hacking

57
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,190
from the outside internals hacking from

58
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,890
the inside so I typically you place a

59
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,320
laptop on site or a Dropbox but we can

60
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,610
say assume breach

61
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,650
how we got in regardless we're inside

62
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,550
the network so that's what we're

63
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,390
defining here for this talk so this talk

64
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,040
is also based on my experiences Ben

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,990
duster you're a pen tester you've been

66
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,330
doing it your top five may vary this is

67
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,920
just what I've seen when I've been doing

68
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,870
pen tests and then please hold any

69
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,250
questions until after the end you can

70
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,810
come see me I have stickers you want

71
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,490
stickers

72
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,170
so the first one is a lemon are

73
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,140
poisoning so what is a lemon are that is

74
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,930
link-local multicast name resolution so

75
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,990
it is basically acts as DNS when DNS

76
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,300
fails to do so it was previously known

77
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,570
as what's called MB TNS NetBIOS so the

78
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,510
key flaw here is that when a the service

79
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,240
utilizes a user's hash to actually

80
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,520
respond to so you'll see here in an

81
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,600
example when we use a tool called

82
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,450
responder we can actually capture ntlm

83
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,030
v2 hashes and we can take those offline

84
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,230
try to crack them and do some other

85
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,600
malicious things with them here so let's

86
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,640
take a look at an overview of this so

87
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,980
let's say that we have a victim and this

88
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,350
victim is trying to connect to a file

89
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,460
share in the file share it's called

90
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,590
hackney but for whatever reason they

91
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,960
type in hack em DNS doesn't know what

92
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,390
hack em is and the server doesn't know

93
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,800
what hack em is so it's gonna say I have

94
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,970
no idea what you're talkin about

95
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,560
so it's the victim we're gonna send out

96
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,840
a broadcast message to everybody we're

97
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,010
gonna say hey does anybody know how to

98
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,930
connect to this and we're gonna be

99
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,190
sitting in the middle with responder

100
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,300
we're gonna respond to that room say

101
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,890
yeah I do send me send me your

102
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,420
credentials I'll get you over there and

103
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,430
then the victim is gonna send over the

104
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,470
hash so let's take a look at what that

105
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,300
looks like from me real life perspective

106
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,488
so this is what responder looks like

107
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:19,220
with just a Python tool will run

108
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,540
responder will listen for these events

109
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,090
on the network and this is something

110
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,620
that is an attacker if we're doing a

111
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,910
penetration test this is probably one of

112
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,970
the first things I I run before I do

113
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,260
scanning before I do anything I'm

114
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,090
running this because around 8 o'clock

115
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,560
when people are getting in a lot of

116
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,300
traffic around lunchtime loud traffic

117
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,820
events are generated and we start

118
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,370
pulling in hashes pretty easily so let's

119
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,320
say an event occurs here's again

120
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,850
somebody trying to access a file share

121
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,490
that they can't access and we get a hash

122
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,430
so old Frank Castle here on the Marvel

123
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,620
domain we could see his IP address his

124
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,270
domain and his user name and you get

125
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,850
this really long hash so what we could

126
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,200
do with that hash is we could take it

127
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,760
and we can put it into something like

128
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,770
hash Pat and if your passwords weak

129
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,200
we're gonna crack it so you can see

130
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,800
password 1 here we get it cracked and no

131
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,300
problem now we have Frank we could try

132
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,590
to pass that password around the network

133
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,650
or do other malicious item

134
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,419
which we'll talk about here in a second

135
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:18,880
so when we talk about mitigation with

136
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,100
this the best defense is to turn off LM

137
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,020
n R and M be T and s you got to turn

138
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,490
them both off is he going to turn one or

139
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,310
the other they'll still be in play if

140
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,229
the company cannot for whatever reason

141
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,790
turn these things off then we do

142
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,500
recommend network access control so at

143
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,240
least that there's some prevention on

144
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,080
site and we require strong password so

145
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,520
ideally the password policy and you

146
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,770
should utilize this in anything is at

147
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,470
least 14 characters if not longer the

148
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,120
longer and more complex without using

149
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,510
common words so the longest password

150
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,070
I've cracked is 19 characters and that's

151
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,020
because it was a Bible verse so just

152
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,550
because it's long doesn't mean it's it's

153
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,110
good and you know just because it's

154
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,210
complex doesn't mean it's long enough so

155
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,460
we really need that that length plus

156
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,870
that complexity if you got like a 40

157
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,250
character sentence or something crazy

158
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,830
that will work really really well so it

159
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,150
doesn't have to be crazy complex of yet

160
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,280
length but you do have to have a link

161
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,669
therefore for us to be able to not crack

162
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:16,360
these so moving on into number two

163
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,000
number two is past the password or past

164
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,750
the hash

165
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,630
so if we do crack a password or we can

166
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,130
dump Sam hashes we can leverage these

167
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,570
for a lateral movement in the network

168
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,490
and so here's what passed the passer

169
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,530
looks like you see that we are passing

170
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,750
this password now of the user F Castle

171
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,760
with the marble domain and we're taking

172
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,920
that password one that we found and all

173
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,030
we're doing is we're spraying the entire

174
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,180
subnet to see if that password works on

175
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,410
any other machines because we know it

176
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,510
works on his machine but what about

177
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,820
everywhere else so if he isn't a local

178
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,220
administrator on another machine you're

179
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,190
gonna see that pwned light up there and

180
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,870
basically we know we can go access that

181
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,970
machine as that user and gain a shell

182
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,730
and that machine as well so you see this

183
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,070
a lot in networks password reuse big

184
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,290
time especially local administrators or

185
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,970
like a tech support account there was a

186
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,500
pen test a couple weeks ago I had that

187
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,780
had cyber-ark on it and all their

188
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,340
passwords were insanely long weren't

189
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,050
cracking them but their local passwords

190
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,370
were really bad and they were reusing

191
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,420
them all over the place so we were able

192
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,650
to leverage those to get around the

193
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,780
network even though they had amazing you

194
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,800
know spent millions of dollars on

195
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,710
security the local administrator side of

196
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,360
it really really took him down so other

197
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,730
option here is we can get the hash so

198
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,590
say we do have a shell say we grabbed

199
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,690
you know grab the shell and we can dump

200
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,430
that administrator that F Castle or if

201
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,420
there's a new minister of hash that

202
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,580
hasn't been disabled we could dump that

203
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,130
hash and we could also run that through

204
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,650
crack map exec here and same thing

205
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,290
instead of supplying the you know the

206
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,240
domain we're just gonna supply a local

207
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,820
user hash with capital H and - - local

208
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,010
fire that away and see where we own the

209
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,270
only machine that we owned here was his

210
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,980
own so we didn't really get anywhere but

211
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,300
a lot of times this does work so when we

212
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,560
talk about pass the hash pass the

213
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,850
password where comes the mitigation

214
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,560
these are hard to completely prevent but

215
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,510
we can do some things to make it more

216
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,030
difficult so one thing is to a limit

217
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,950
account for you so if you've got local

218
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,150
administrators you know really don't

219
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,590
give people local administrators and

220
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,240
absolutely need it there's not really

221
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,440
good reason for a lot of people to have

222
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,800
it

223
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,680
another thing is disabling that guest in

224
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,410
administrator account and just limiting

225
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,480
access and again limit who is a local

226
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,040
administrator at least privilege here a

227
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,650
lot of users want that to install stuff

228
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,170
and it just it just ends up bad for more

229
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,750
reasons than just this so that's one

230
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,640
reason another reason is another

231
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,990
mitigation is to utilize strong

232
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,929
passwords again so if we can't crack a

233
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:42,010
password or even get onto them

234
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,958
then it's gonna be really hard for us to

235
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,399
actually pass a password around in the

236
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,550
first place and the last one is Pam so I

237
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,899
talked about cyber-ark so Pam's

238
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:51,579
privileged access management basically

239
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:53,370
that's like an account check-in checkout

240
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,079
things so you store your accounts in

241
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:57,430
something like cyber-ark

242
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,930
and then you go and you log in you say I

243
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,790
want to check this account out you check

244
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,290
that account out it belongs to you it

245
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,120
gives you a password that's like 15 to

246
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,730
30 characters long and you own that

247
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,350
account with that password for 8 hours

248
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,180
or so and then it checks itself back in

249
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,410
if you don't check it back in so that

250
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,480
password is always rotating so even if

251
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,130
we get on to a machine we dump ashes

252
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,779
dump passwords they're constantly

253
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:17,829
rotating we're not gonna be able to do

254
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:19,449
anything so that's why when I was in

255
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:21,010
that engagement at least on the Active

256
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,230
Directory side of things I had no chance

257
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,519
against cracking those accounts they're

258
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,040
way too long way too complex but again

259
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,600
the local admin accounts can be

260
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,250
dangerous so third one is what is called

261
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,070
token or personation so those are

262
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,050
temporary keys that allow you access to

263
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,029
a system and you could think of these

264
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:41,740
basically as cookies these are cookies

265
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,079
for your computer so there are two types

266
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:45,850
that you can see one is called delegate

267
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,800
the other one is called impersonate so

268
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,329
delegate is like you logged in with

269
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:51,069
Remote Desktop you're gonna leave a

270
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:53,709
delegate token behind the other one is

271
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:55,000
non interactive so if you have like a

272
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,100
network drive or some kind of logon

273
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,079
script that you use then you're gonna

274
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:00,760
leave behind it in a person a cookie now

275
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,100
these cookies stay there as long as that

276
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,750
computer has not been restarted so if

277
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,760
you have a computer up and you call

278
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,860
helpdesk helpdesk this domain admin they

279
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,420
login to your computer through a remote

280
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,250
desktop you're leaving behind a delegate

281
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,000
token as that user so let's take a look

282
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,290
at why it's bad

283
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,319
so let's say we get on to a system and

284
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:22,339
at the top you can see that we are

285
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:24,350
authority system so we own the machine

286
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,389
but there are tokens available to

287
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:27,889
impersonate here with this tool called

288
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:29,529
incognito this is actually built into

289
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,569
Metasploit or meterpreter so I'm going

290
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:34,249
to impersonate this user of Marvel F

291
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:37,759
castle and we're gonna go into a shell

292
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,439
we're gonna say Who am I and now we are

293
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:43,279
Marvel F Castle great from here I'm

294
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,049
gonna try to run me me cats which is

295
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:47,449
just going to try to dump passwords so

296
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:49,039
I'm trying to dump passwords off of the

297
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,379
domain controller and if this is domain

298
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:52,910
administrator this might be able to work

299
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,339
for us here you see that we have an

300
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:57,079
access denied the access is dying

301
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:58,759
because Frank Castle is not actually a

302
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,819
domain administrator but what if a

303
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:04,879
domain admin token was available so now

304
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,319
you see that the administrator has

305
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:07,970
Remote Desktop in this machine left the

306
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,069
token behind and we're gonna go ahead

307
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:13,519
and impersonate that token now we say

308
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,970
Who am I Marvel administrator

309
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,140
try this one more time

310
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,200
and we just dump all the hashes and in

311
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,120
this sense we basically own we own

312
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,220
everything we can take these offline and

313
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,320
try to crack them this Kerberos ticket

314
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,870
granting ticket hash can lead to what is

315
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,690
called a golden ticket attack and that

316
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,760
we own every single every single

317
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,200
computer in the network with a golden

318
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,600
ticket attack at least in the domain so

319
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,450
a big big deal if you capture that hash

320
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,450
there and so when we talk about

321
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,810
mitigation we can limit the user group

322
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,839
tokens here a bigger strategy is account

323
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:54,490
tearing so you'll see some places

324
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,500
utilize this and more and more are

325
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,180
moving to it but like you might have Bob

326
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,100
and Bob's a domain admin so Bob will

327
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,769
have a regular account user account and

328
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:04,060
then he'll have a domain atom account

329
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,890
and that domain I have an account only

330
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,899
logs into the domain administrator or

331
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,370
like domain controller or where they're

332
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,050
needed and they won't be utilizing that

333
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,820
to log into something like you know a

334
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,220
user's computer or a server or something

335
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,230
else they'll be using their local

336
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,700
account to do that or there there's a

337
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,649
locally or their domain user account to

338
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:22,120
do it not a domain admin account

339
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,399
so again local admin account restriction

340
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,310
is big here because we need a system

341
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,740
shell to actually pull this off so if

342
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,750
we're not a system on the account like a

343
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,910
highest level then we're not going to

344
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,320
pull this off and the reason we get the

345
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,720
high level system access is when a user

346
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,310
is a local administrator so once we get

347
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,260
that local administrator shell then we

348
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,760
own this we can start doing token

349
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,740
impersonation and this attack becomes

350
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,930
pretty dangerous so number four so this

351
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,300
plays back into number one number one

352
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,220
was LM in R and if you remember we

353
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,810
actually gathered the hashes took them

354
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,490
offline and cracked them instead of

355
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,810
doing that we can actually pass these

356
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,180
hashes and just let's do what's called a

357
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,100
relay so we're gonna use SMB relay

358
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,199
attack so there's two requirements here

359
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:07,690
so one thing is that SMB signing has to

360
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,209
be disabled a good thing for us is SMB

361
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:12,279
signing is disabled by default on all

362
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,279
workstations servers it is enabled so

363
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,079
basically that SMB signing says you are

364
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,029
who you say you are so what we're gonna

365
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:20,949
do is we're just going to pass this hash

366
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:23,050
along and say hey we are this person let

367
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,300
us into your machine if that person is a

368
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,149
local admin on that machine we can dump

369
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:29,860
ashes we can get a shell there's a lot

370
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,329
of malicious things that we can do with

371
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:33,410
this so I

372
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,730
we need we need that signing to be

373
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,620
disabled so this is mainly a lateral

374
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,839
movement attack and then we need that

375
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:41,509
local admin privilege again so let's

376
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:43,580
take a look at what it looks like

377
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,170
so a couple things we're going to turn

378
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,269
off in the responder configuration we're

379
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:49,850
going to turn off SMB and HTTP is we're

380
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,080
actually gonna pass those along instead

381
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,010
of actively listening

382
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,240
we're gonna run responder again just

383
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,740
this time you can see the there's a

384
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,480
little bit more red in the offs down

385
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,040
there in the middle under the servers

386
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,130
we're listening on and we're also gonna

387
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,050
spin up what's called an TL and relay X

388
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,040
pi

389
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,190
another part of this impact toolkit all

390
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,390
these tools I've been using here are

391
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,160
part of impacted tool kit for the most

392
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,019
part so we're gonna specify a target

393
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:18,260
file and we're just gonna let it fly so

394
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,459
again when an event occurs like this

395
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,750
instead of the hash coming to us the

396
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,070
hash goes to that machine that we

397
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,649
specified in the targets file and if

398
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,329
that user is a local admin you can see

399
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:31,399
down there we just accessed another

400
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:33,500
machine Peter Parker's machine and we

401
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,060
started dumping all the hashes on Peter

402
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,640
Parker's machine so now we've got new

403
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,260
hashes available to us so we can go and

404
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,420
try to pass around see maybe where Peter

405
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,700
Parker has access to repeat step two

406
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,140
that we saw and keep trying to move

407
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,790
laterally along until we find that

408
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,560
domain credential or something that we

409
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,600
can get access to inside the network so

410
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,250
a lot of this is about lateral movement

411
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,540
until you find that way to escalate up

412
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,950
there's a bunch of different strategies

413
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,459
we can we can have here the enabling SNP

414
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:03,800
signing will stop this attack you will

415
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,930
have some some admins complain about

416
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,350
that because there is what they say it's

417
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,240
about a 15% increase in the time it

418
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,980
takes to transfer a file to a file share

419
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,290
although the file share but for security

420
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,670
purposes I don't think that's that bad

421
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,490
you can also disable ntlm authentication

422
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,310
but if you use that it stops the attack

423
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,949
but if if that fails and it falls back

424
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:27,680
to Kerberos then it's going to it's

425
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,209
gonna be happening all over the place

426
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:31,490
again so again we could talk about

427
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,579
account tearing if we're not utilizing

428
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:36,320
domain administrator accounts or

429
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,540
utilizing those on machines we're still

430
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,920
gonna have issues with this and the

431
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,269
local admin restriction if we're not a

432
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:43,190
local admin we can't have this happen so

433
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,230
again it all plays down to these local

434
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,060
admins and a lot of its local admin and

435
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,880
password is really how we we navigate

436
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,500
these networks okay and the last one is

437
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,940
Kerberos tting so Kerberos is a

438
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,959
authentication method for Windows it's

439
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,540
how you use it in a domain so let's talk

440
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,010
about how it works and we'll talk about

441
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,370
why this is bad

442
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,680
so we have a late domain controller and

443
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,210
we call it domain controller the KDC

444
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,070
which is the key distribution center and

445
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,500
if we have a valid credential so say

446
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,290
Frank castle with password 1 we can

447
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,660
request a what's called a t GG it's a

448
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,150
ticket granting ticket so we as the user

449
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,520
can say hey KD C I want to request a

450
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,820
ticket the KDC is going to send back

451
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,760
that ticket to us and we are going to

452
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,030
have a ticket then we say ok there's

453
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,770
maybe an application server or something

454
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,870
like a sequel server whatever it is or

455
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,240
something running that we maybe want

456
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,970
access to now what these have is what's

457
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,860
called a service principle name or an SP

458
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,930
n so say we want to access this

459
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,210
application server we're gonna act ask

460
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,810
for a service ticket or a TGS so we're

461
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,070
gonna take that we're gonna say hey

462
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,080
domain controller here's my ticket my

463
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,300
TGT can you give me a TGS while you're

464
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,340
at it and the domain controllers going

465
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,290
to say sure and while I'm at it since I

466
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,240
have no idea if you can authenticate to

467
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,640
that I'm going to encrypt the hash of

468
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,770
that that server account or that that

469
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,230
account with this ticket so then what

470
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,130
you're gonna do is you're going to

471
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,660
present that ticket to the application

472
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,459
server it's going to decrypt it check

473
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,740
your permissions and then say if yes you

474
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,240
can can access me or no you can access

475
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,420
me we never need to do five and six

476
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,130
because we have valid authentication or

477
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,260
we have a valid ticket we just get that

478
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,760
that ticket back with that encrypted

479
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,109
hash and then we take it offline and try

480
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:31,320
to crack so let's take a look at this

481
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,840
and make more sense of it so we've got

482
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,510
this this marble frank castle with

483
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,520
password 1 and the domain controller is

484
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,610
living at 10.0 point 3 point 4 and we're

485
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,170
just making a request and what comes

486
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,790
down here are the you see the service

487
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,310
principal names so there is one sequel

488
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,260
server running here a sequel service

489
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,980
running and you can see the member of

490
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,080
says domain admins all the time we see

491
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,330
this people put service counts in their

492
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,460
domain admins and if we're able to now

493
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,620
take this hash that we just got because

494
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,090
this happens regardless as long as we

495
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,430
have a valid ticket we have this hash we

496
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,720
can go take it offline if we can crack

497
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,850
it we now own a domain admin account so

498
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,310
take this offline this is a 14 character

499
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,260
password again this is why even 14

500
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,820
characters isn't that great because this

501
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,000
will run with RockYou and bracket so

502
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,880
crack this password and we could take

503
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,340
that and leverage it so when it comes to

504
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,200
mitigation strategies really because

505
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,150
this is a feature built into Windows

506
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,520
already you need strong passwords really

507
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,720
strong passwords for your service

508
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,940
accounts and again it comes down to

509
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,380
lease privilege with with all this

510
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,020
question

511
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,130
good thank you guys

512
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,659
[Applause]
