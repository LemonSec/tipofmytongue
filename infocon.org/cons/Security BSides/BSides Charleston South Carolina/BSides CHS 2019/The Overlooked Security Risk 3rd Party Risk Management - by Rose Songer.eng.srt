1
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,020
all right welcome everybody we are here

2
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,170
to talk about third party risk

3
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,420
management you'll see that I noted this

4
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,660
as the overlooked security risk really

5
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,149
that just means the business has a

6
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:46,370
tendency to overlook third party risk

7
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,850
and what it can do business so we'll get

8
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,110
into that a little bit later so a little

9
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,290
about me I'm from Pittsburgh so I

10
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,610
traveled here to be at Charleston ah got

11
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,129
two kids and I married one of my kids

12
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,170
wrestles so we're in wrestling season

13
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,630
right now good stuff I don't know if any

14
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,429
of you guys have ever had the pleasure

15
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:12,500
it's I think it's mainly a northern

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,880
thing um it gets really intense so a

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,320
little more on the professional side

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,490
though I am a GRC consultant so I work

19
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,140
with governance risk and apply it to

20
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,450
help companies build security programs

21
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,220
based on whatever frameworks that they

22
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,009
need so I do a lot of policy writing

23
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:34,340
program building being an adviser to

24
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,830
them I have my masters in cyber security

25
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,739
and information assurance so when I got

26
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:41,660
my masters that did a lot of Red Team

27
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,940
work a little bit of blue team and just

28
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,950
the sprinkling of GRC so I have a lot of

29
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,560
different background I have my

30
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,429
bachelor's in advanced networking I was

31
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:54,080
a network engineer for quite some time

32
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,630
so in order to be in security you kind

33
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,860
of have to know all these different

34
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,039
things

35
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,960
so you'll see I have 13 years in IT I'm

36
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,240
so old I joined the Navy right when I

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,730
turned 18 so I'm in my young thirties

38
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,410
now I've been in security for the last

39
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,080
eight years and I have a lot of industry

40
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,340
experience over retail healthcare you

41
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,240
know government and higher education so

42
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,550
you'll see on this slide if you guys are

43
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,020
familiar with Prezi you can set it up

44
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,790
any way that you want this is my table

45
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,890
of contents we're just gonna kind of

46
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,820
slip on through it so third parties

47
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,650
they're everywhere

48
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,140
businesses nowadays you will not find a

49
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,550
business that does not use a third party

50
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,910
in some sort of fashion there are

51
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,130
consultants like me there doing

52
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,290
marketing for your company there are be

53
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,170
service providers SAS they're providing

54
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,070
your infrastructure

55
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,470
whatever it is third parties are doing

56
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,390
it for majority of companies you won't

57
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,730
find many that will have everything

58
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,000
in-house and so when we talk about third

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,040
party risk it's really important that

60
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,070
the business understands how big of a

61
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,230
risk this poses to them and that they're

62
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,670
evaluating it properly

63
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,830
so now we're going to talk about what

64
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,320
third party risk management is we've

65
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,480
talked about how third parties are in

66
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,900
the business we use online third parties

67
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,180
can provide services to you so third

68
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,310
party risk management you're gonna use a

69
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,830
due diligence process to evaluate those

70
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,950
vendors for their security controls the

71
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,930
evaluation can be whatever your business

72
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,210
beam's important but ultimately you're

73
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,470
trying to protect the confidentiality

74
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,050
integrity and availability of any data

75
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,350
that they may have you also most

76
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,210
importantly want to help the business

77
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:57,080
make risk aware decisions security we

78
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,380
are here to advise the business we're

79
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,720
not here to tell them no or slow them

80
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,570
down we need to tell them what has the

81
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,000
most impact to their business and help

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,980
them make the right decision and if they

83
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,870
are moving for with a vendor that they

84
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,210
shouldn't move forward with then the

85
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,370
business needs to step that risk that

86
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,290
risk doesn't come to security it goes to

87
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,280
the business and also third-party risk

88
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,020
management what we're talking about

89
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,900
right now is primarily for assessing

90
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,930
vendors providing your organization with

91
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,540
services later on in the presentation we

92
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,860
will discuss if you are a consulting

93
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,380
firm or someone providing services to a

94
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,600
third party that's constantly being

95
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,430
assessed so that opposite side of third

96
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,080
party risk management any questions no

97
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,050
is anybody just to kind of get an idea

98
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,760
of who you guys are

99
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,870
how many are you our students

100
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,110
okay and the rest of you you are in our

101
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,880
organization are you part of the

102
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,350
third-party risk management program

103
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,190
right now no have you ever had any

104
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,540
insight to it does your organization

105
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:13,630
even have one set up no okay or are you

106
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,130
on the flip side are you a company

107
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,730
that's constantly being assessed

108
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,740
No so what you're looking at right now

109
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,460
is the vendor lifecycle so when you have

110
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,200
a vendor come into your organization

111
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,990
it's going to start going through what I

112
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,630
call the vendor lifecycle every

113
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,920
organization may call this something

114
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,770
differently you may think of it in a

115
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,690
different way but this is just what I've

116
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,210
come to know my years of doing third

117
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,730
person so first you're gonna have

118
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,580
governance like with any program you

119
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,290
shouldn't be running it unless you have

120
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,790
your governance in place so your

121
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,010
policies your standards your procedures

122
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,280
what's gonna drive that program most

123
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,170
people don't like doing that part of

124
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,170
vendor Asst manager they'd rather be in

125
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,120
the technical details or doing that sort

126
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,950
of work luckily there's people like me

127
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,350
who really do love the governance risk

128
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,580
and compliance and writing up the

129
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,080
documentation and kind of driving that

130
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,660
program next once you have your

131
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,790
governance do it up that's what the

132
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,830
business really should be starting to

133
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,130
bring in those third parties so you have

134
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,050
your planning phase so whether it's

135
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,440
humans um business units whoever it may

136
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,360
be they're going out to vendors and

137
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,850
they're trying to put in you know RFPs

138
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,920
and understand what services they want

139
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,540
to get from vendors and so once they

140
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,000
identify these vendors that is when

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,920
security steps in for the due diligence

142
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,710
phase in the new diligence phase we're

143
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,360
gonna actually go into that a little

144
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,480
more in depth right now we will not

145
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,460
cover the other portions just because

146
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,450
it's not as relevant to us but I do when

147
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,680
I talk about the life cycle so you

148
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,510
understand it how it applies to your

149
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,420
organization so after due diligence

150
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,990
you'll move into contract negotiation

151
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,940
when we talk about due diligence you'll

152
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,580
be able to kind of understand why the

153
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,710
contract negotiation is really important

154
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,760
ongoing monitoring so this is not a once

155
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,190
and dine with your vendors unfortunately

156
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,690
you have to keep assessing them on a

157
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,120
regular basis because threats are always

158
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,830
there they're always evolving controls

159
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,680
constantly need to be updated

160
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,400
depending on the framework and

161
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,310
everything so ongoing monitoring and

162
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,060
there are some regulations that dry

163
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,950
you know doing it on a yearly cadence

164
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,550
like PCI

165
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,380
and then once you decide you want to

166
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,700
stop working with the vendor you

167
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,620
terminate that contract or you stop

168
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,830
working with them for termination if you

169
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,650
have been trading any data with the

170
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,180
vendor it's really important that you

171
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,520
get a certificate of destruction that's

172
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,760
just gonna have your vendor verify that

173
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,220
they have in fact removed any data that

174
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,900
they may have from your organization

175
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,670
really important if they're working with

176
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,760
really sensitive data any questions

177
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,190
so due diligence like I said this is

178
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,340
where Security's gonna live um this is

179
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,690
where we're really gonna start getting

180
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,790
to know the vendor understanding what

181
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,320
services they may be provided to the

182
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,780
organization called the due diligence

183
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,900
process or whatever your organization

184
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,349
wants to come

185
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,970
so we need to understand the scope

186
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,980
before we start doing anything with the

187
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,860
vendor you won't be able to truly assess

188
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,340
them and be able to read the assessment

189
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,539
unless you know what services are

190
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,870
providing so I have a couple items up

191
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,870
here that I have found to be the most

192
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,940
important to understand for their

193
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,210
services data classification this is

194
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,180
very very very important so data within

195
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,710
your organization should be classified

196
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,200
if you have really sensitive data such

197
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,470
as PII pH I financial data whatever it

198
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,870
may be you need to classify that so you

199
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,180
know when it leads your organization you

200
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,830
kind of understand what controls you

201
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,760
want them to do to protect it data

202
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,740
classification seems to have like three

203
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,610
levels

204
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,320
it could be unconfident 'el or public

205
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,570
regulated confidential or the military

206
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,700
uses different classification levels it

207
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,200
just depends on what your organization

208
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,260
wants you know the organization the

209
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,880
company can kind of drive all those

210
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,440
decisions probably want to classify the

211
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,960
data how they look at it so really

212
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,550
important that you understand what's

213
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,290
leaving your organization

214
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,960
also if they're gonna store transmit

215
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,810
process data you need to know this and

216
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,190
you need to understand how they're gonna

217
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,700
do this so that way when they answer the

218
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,290
questions you can look at it and really

219
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,840
get the full picture and understanding

220
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,880
of what they are doing

221
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,390
and next remote access are they going to

222
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,910
need access into our environment and if

223
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,680
so how are they going to do that and

224
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,910
what are we going to evaluate

225
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,399
software-as-a-service functionality

226
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,529
software-as-a-service really important

227
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:16,420
that's where everything's going holidays

228
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,939
put your stuff into the cloud and that's

229
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:19,480
it

230
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,579
but it's really important that we

231
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,769
understand that we're also responsible

232
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:25,870
for maintaining and managing all those

233
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,529
controls that go up there so you need to

234
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,499
do access reviews and you need to you

235
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:35,199
know make sure that people know not to

236
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:38,379
do certain stuff on there so software is

237
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:39,670
a service you need to make sure you're

238
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,709
evaluating it and understanding holidays

239
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:44,699
built their platform

240
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,160
questions

241
00:10:51,100 --> 00:11:04,540
all right yes okay so really good

242
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,480
question let's look at it from two

243
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,030
different perspectives there security so

244
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,030
we're always gonna care about the

245
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,770
security controls and protecting the

246
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,810
data and all that stuff that falls into

247
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,120
our security realm the other side of the

248
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,670
stakeholders is the business so the

249
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,800
business is going to be anybody vested

250
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,710
in that vendor relationship that can be

251
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,160
you know the VP a business unit it could

252
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,130
be a manager it could be external

253
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,650
stakeholders it could be the board it

254
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:38,740
just depends on I hate saying it depends

255
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,690
because it's such a big answer but it

256
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,400
truly does depend on the nature of the

257
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,130
vendor so if this vendor is just coming

258
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,780
in they're not gonna receive any data

259
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,230
they're not gonna do anything but come

260
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,090
in and consult ok well that might be a

261
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,040
lower-risk vendor that the whole

262
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,990
organization meaning the board or

263
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,600
whatever may not care to know about but

264
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,610
what if there's a vendor that we're

265
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,010
sending all of our phi2 so they can

266
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,830
analyze that pH I and provide an output

267
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,410
ok well that's a high risk vendor and

268
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,510
the business all the way up to the board

269
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,030
may want to know you know the risk

270
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,010
associated with that does that make

271
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,910
sense ok yeah it depends it's such a big

272
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,370
answer and it's a I hate saying that

273
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,140
answer cuz you know it doesn't really

274
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,970
give you a whole lot of clarity but in

275
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:30,300
this situation yeah best judgement

276
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,420
okay so now we move on to the risk

277
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,590
assessment

278
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,960
you are trying to evaluate their overall

279
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,090
security posture and there's some level

280
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,640
of trust that has to go between you and

281
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,040
the vendor you have to

282
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,380
try to trust them that they're providing

283
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,870
you all the right answers and not trying

284
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,600
to live in that gray area where they

285
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,890
kind of do it but they kind of don't so

286
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,140
it's really hard but it it gets better

287
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,620
if you're using uh like third-party

288
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,340
certifications or access stations to

289
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,590
validate their responses so a lot of

290
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:16,220
times you can use a saw to type - that

291
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,840
is more into the security controls and a

292
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,340
third-party vendor would have came in

293
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,400
and evaluated them the same goes for the

294
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,650
ISO 27001 I am NOT a fan of using that

295
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,660
one though because if you're not being

296
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,520
very diligent at what you're looking at

297
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,840
you can certify just one thing and you

298
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,550
know that may not be applicable to the

299
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,100
services that the vendors providing so

300
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,600
it's all about really paying attention

301
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,410
to those key details along with you know

302
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,180
evaluating their posture you have to

303
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,110
provide them a standard questionnaire to

304
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,970
fill in a lot of places kind of just

305
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,260
develop it based on what they really

306
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,780
need to know if you're struggling to

307
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,910
figure out the type of assessment to

308
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,460
build I would suggest this cybersecurity

309
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,440
framework and just starting to go down

310
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,070
the line

311
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,470
the cybersecurity framework has a lot of

312
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,000
controls in there that could be

313
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,550
applicable to your organization and you

314
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,440
can wear them in a way that you would

315
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,780
get really good responses to with those

316
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,210
questionnaires though I would advise you

317
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,520
guys not to be too wordy with the

318
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,170
questions I like to be mindful that not

319
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,510
everybody answering these questionnaires

320
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,700
is gonna be a security expert sometimes

321
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,580
it's going to be a just the IT Help Desk

322
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,150
person or it could just be an assistant

323
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,070
or whoever it may be and that

324
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,080
unfortunately is just the name of the

325
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,020
game that has a lot to say with their

326
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,540
security - if they have that sort of

327
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,270
person right but I mean it is what it is

328
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,640
people are trying to develop their

329
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,070
businesses and can't always have you

330
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:02,020
know the top-notch security go ahead

331
00:15:04,800 --> 00:16:25,090
yeah yeah well I would like I mentioned

332
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,410
before the NIST cybersecurity framework

333
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,680
is a really good place to start but the

334
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,260
volume of questions gets really high and

335
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,960
that in turn makes people not want to

336
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,700
answer them so you probably see like a

337
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,190
really long time responses if it starts

338
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,860
getting longer if they do it at all um

339
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,070
and there's kind of like a bunch of

340
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,480
routes that you could take with that if

341
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,400
they don't do it at all well then why

342
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,950
are we giving them business why are we

343
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,540
letting them sign the contract and

344
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,740
that's kind of a route that you would

345
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,870
take with your procurement team or legal

346
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,640
or whoever's handling the contract

347
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,770
because if they're not even willing to

348
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,520
answer the assessment then why are we

349
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,810
exchanging services with them why are we

350
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:08,230
letting them continue down that path now

351
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,630
as far as the standardized questionnaire

352
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,669
that's a really tough one because a lot

353
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:16,189
of organizations have a lot of different

354
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:19,699
questionnaires every organization will

355
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:22,039
have you know their own versioning of it

356
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:24,650
and so now you have a issue with the

357
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,959
vendors receiving 50 million different

358
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,419
types of questionnaires instead of just

359
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:31,690
the one that they can easily answer back

360
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:45,130
have you ever heard of a sig yeah yes

361
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,150
yeah

362
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:08,510
tedious yes how many questions to use

363
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,990
right now

364
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,220
yep it gets painful for sure especially

365
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,740
when they're marking that they don't do

366
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,540
something all right well what do you do

367
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,790
now because now you have a bunch of

368
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,570
potential risk and so I worked at a

369
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,280
major retailer and dicks I actually

370
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,470
stood up a program there where we built

371
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,750
in full automation of risk assessments

372
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,570
using a sass so bender fills out the

373
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,700
questionnaire I already automatically

374
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,160
score it so you know based on their

375
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,290
answers if they were above our risk

376
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,790
tolerance then they would just

377
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,320
automatically pass and I wouldn't even

378
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,560
see them unless to verify like do an

379
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,040
audit spot-check or something but the

380
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,590
ones that had negative responses and too

381
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,880
many of them they would go through the

382
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,040
risk acceptance process so is that

383
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,540
something that you've been doing with

384
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,120
yours instead of going back and forth

385
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,920
just automatically putting them into a

386
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,840
risk acceptance process and making the

387
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,030
business accept those risks and possibly

388
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,890
right in those risks into the contract

389
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,630
and making them fix it within a certain

390
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,560
amount of time so a lot of a lot of

391
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,070
factors go into it it's while I'm

392
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,430
providing all of these like pointers

393
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,810
sitting down and really consuming the

394
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,970
information it's the most important part

395
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,470
of it and working with the business but

396
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,250
the business being what's the risk

397
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,180
tolerance

398
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,810
you know what data are they allowing to

399
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,550
leave the building and that sort of side

400
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,400
of it but on the security side working

401
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,020
with security to figure out what

402
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,000
questions are the most important are you

403
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,770
just asking a bunch of questions like if

404
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,360
you look at that question and you see

405
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,220
the response and you're like I don't

406
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,810
really care about that question should

407
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,270
you even be asking it or should you only

408
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,250
be asking those questions that are like

409
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,620
deal-breakers to your organization you

410
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,979
know what I mean

411
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,870
a little bit yeah I could talk with you

412
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,610
more afterwards if you want a brainstorm

413
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,540
on okay I I live in Pittsburgh so I have

414
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:59,080
a flight to catch all right um so we

415
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,820
talked about I talked about risk scoring

416
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,040
a little bit just now but always make

417
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,820
sure you have constant analysis by using

418
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,120
risk scoring the risk scoring if you're

419
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,460
just using high medium low or whatever

420
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,590
that's very subjective so I would highly

421
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,500
suggest you getting with your peers in

422
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,510
security and working together to risk

423
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,970
for the questions appropriately so that

424
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,800
way when they respond back you have the

425
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,230
right risk score like I said it can be

426
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,230
subjective so you don't want to think

427
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,540
that it's a very high when you know the

428
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,250
rest of the team may think it's a medium

429
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,440
based on compensating controls or

430
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,570
whatever does that make sense yeah

431
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,210
okay so since we kind of talked about

432
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,880
you know building risk assessments we're

433
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,200
gonna talk about it a little more in

434
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,590
depth right now so like I mentioned the

435
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,110
NIST cybersecurity framework my personal

436
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,340
favorite because it just throws

437
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,930
everything right there for you it has

438
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,330
all the controls and in fact when we get

439
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,820
to the demo later you will see in the

440
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,510
demo I do use the controls from this to

441
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,670
build out some questions for you guys to

442
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:09,060
see so we also have these functional

443
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,400
areas so if you don't use NIST these

444
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,370
functional areas of the company that

445
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,230
you're assessing should be what you're

446
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,430
looking at in a generic sense you may

447
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,070
end up calling it something different

448
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,170
but governance asset management

449
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,080
threatened vulnerability management

450
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,850
incident response and recovery workforce

451
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,250
management meaning security awareness

452
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,650
and how they're training their people

453
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,430
risk management

454
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,860
identity and access management

455
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,820
situational awareness or are they

456
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,380
staying on top of the trends and

457
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,510
alerting and what's going on in the

458
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,640
Twitter world because everything on

459
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,710
Twitter happens instantly and you know

460
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:50,190
all the risk or vendor risk management

461
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,440
are they actually assessing their own

462
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,840
vendors because if not that's a problem

463
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,640
because they could be sending your data

464
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,460
to a third party a fourth party to you

465
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,150
and now you lose extra sight of those

466
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:06,000
risks or that data

467
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,520
are they protecting their data at rest

468
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,690
and transit these are all those areas or

469
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,130
what you're trying to figure out what

470
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,740
they're doing at their organization so

471
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,990
you want to ask questions that are going

472
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,320
to let you know if they're doing these

473
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,260
main things and all these can be mapped

474
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,920
to NIST in some sort of fashion in fact

475
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,120
they could probably be mapped to any

476
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,980
framework that you pick you're just

477
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,940
depending on the wording that they use

478
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:41,460
questions all right

479
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,570
so now we're going to talk about

480
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,480
findings you have the scope you've done

481
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,190
the risk assessment well now you have

482
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,750
the findings what do you do with those

483
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,030
you need to communicate on

484
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,510
to the business the business like I

485
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,730
mentioned before is the ultimate

486
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,170
decision makers when it comes to the

487
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,100
vendors they should always be making the

488
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,840
decision whether or not to me moving

489
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,250
forward with the vendor they should own

490
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,800
that risk because I'm not doing anything

491
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,480
with the vendor I'm not transferring

492
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,190
data with the vendor I'm just assessing

493
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,150
them in providing you an opinion on what

494
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,820
you should do or not most the time the

495
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,290
vendors that I interact with haven't

496
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,240
been so terrible that I'm tell the

497
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,160
business not to but there has been risks

498
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,860
I told the business like this wouldn't

499
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,750
be a smart decision you're sending them

500
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,550
certain data and they don't have the

501
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,600
right controls

502
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,159
but when you work with the business

503
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:35,950
whoever the business may be it could be

504
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,460
the vendor risk manager or I mean the

505
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,710
vendor relationship manager the person

506
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,739
bringing that vendor in could be

507
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:46,960
managers whoever you need to clearly

508
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,629
state the risk issue and recommend

509
00:24:49,629 --> 00:24:53,889
remediation um at times security people

510
00:24:53,889 --> 00:24:58,809
or technical people can be um a little

511
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:00,039
too technical when we're talking to

512
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:02,710
others even now sometimes I may say

513
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,559
stuff that um may not be in your realm

514
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:07,809
of what you know and so it's really

515
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:09,669
important that we come together

516
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:11,889
collaboratively and work with the

517
00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:14,320
business and help them understand why

518
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,419
it's a risk and why it's so important

519
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:18,249
and make them feel like they're

520
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:19,929
comfortable enough to come talk to you

521
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:21,669
about these things we always want to

522
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:23,109
make sure we're establishing a really

523
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:25,419
good business relationship with our

524
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:27,099
peers and the other parts in the

525
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:30,239
business you know

526
00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:36,640
remediation so i mentioned whenever we

527
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,500
first looked at the vendor lifecycle

528
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,270
that we would talk about contract

529
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,260
negotiation

530
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,990
all right so contract negotiation is

531
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,690
gonna come in right here remediation so

532
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,539
if there's findings you want to push it

533
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:52,000
on to the vendor to fix it but being

534
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,900
realistic

535
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,090
the vendor may not have the funds the

536
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:59,470
time or maybe this don't want to so if

537
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,309
they aren't willing through mediate

538
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:05,850
write it into the contract if you can't

539
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:09,010
protect the business talk to legal do

540
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:12,400
whatever you need to just communicate we

541
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,400
have a finding it's not being fixed we

542
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,590
need to document push for them to

543
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:21,418
remediate whatever it may be

544
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,480
I don't I haven't had too many vendors

545
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,390
that made like a fuss when they couldn't

546
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,370
fix something but if they don't have

547
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,440
something fundamental in place like

548
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,390
vulnerability management or something

549
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,490
okay well that's gonna be a huge lift

550
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,860
for them to put into place it's not

551
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,450
gonna be something that you know we get

552
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,800
right over and say hey you need to put

553
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,300
this in place before we do business with

554
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,790
you and so that escalates to a decision

555
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,250
that the business needs to decide if

556
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,320
they're okay with that risk of them not

557
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,420
having vulnerability management in place

558
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,820
and at that point as the security

559
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,350
adviser I would tell them that they

560
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,850
absolutely shouldn't be transferring

561
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,340
data with them if they don't even you

562
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,020
know scan and patch like they should

563
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,850
but like I said it's up to the business

564
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,030
all right

565
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,920
risk acceptance so I was briefly

566
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,460
touching on it just then so any findings

567
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,380
that cannot be remediated should be

568
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,630
documented now that's not just talking

569
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,980
about the contract that's talking about

570
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,170
security we need to keep our thumb on

571
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,420
any wrist as they relate to third

572
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,790
parties this can be done in a

573
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,460
spreadsheet and can be done you know in

574
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,760
a database however you want to do it

575
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,350
but I would highly suggest using a

576
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:36,010
consistent form don't just you know from

577
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:39,040
here to there use different forms keep

578
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,810
it consistent it'll make your life so

579
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,220
much easier when you're looking at them

580
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:42,580
later

581
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,450
and you should include the risk the

582
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,520
score and most importantly the reason

583
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,390
for acceptance the business not wanting

584
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,060
to look for a new vendor because you

585
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,190
know they're in a time crunch is that

586
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,130
really a good reason for acceptance

587
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,750
probably not not just security I would

588
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,180
just say go look for another but to them

589
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,280
it may be so they just need to document

590
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,490
that um another reason could be maybe

591
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,640
there are one vendor of three that only

592
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,860
provide that particular service and it's

593
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,530
very like tailored type of vendor okay

594
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,260
well that's sounds like a reasonable

595
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,070
reason for something me and ultimately

596
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,940
everything should roll up to your

597
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,610
enterprise risk management your risk

598
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,290
management committee should be briefed

599
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,610
on these risk high risk vendors um any

600
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,860
vendors that aren't in your threshold

601
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,550
first offense

602
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,820
and finally a scorecard

603
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,750
so you need to have a consistent report

604
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,750
deliverable so you did all this work

605
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,880
well what's your output what are you

606
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,279
providing to someone for their artifact

607
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:57,610
to know so this could look however you

608
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,740
want when I show you in the demo I made

609
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,340
a very very like basic version of it but

610
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,529
you can make it more elaborate if you

611
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:07,750
want and you want to communicate the key

612
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,639
points of the assessment what did you

613
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:12,100
look at what did you find anything

614
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,680
concerning any risk acceptance

615
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,840
and indicate the overall vendor risk

616
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,060
score so depending on the type of

617
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,980
scoring that you put in place in your

618
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,630
organization you may want to put it in

619
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,720
there when I worked at my previous

620
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,130
employer we put in um 80 through f4 the

621
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:34,090
risk scoring so we would have a number

622
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:37,460
side on security but when the business

623
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,090
saw they saw a through F and I mean

624
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,680
that's kind of easy to understand we all

625
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,750
go through the grade system so it's

626
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:48,590
easier for them to understand out and

627
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,480
like I already mentioned and any need

628
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,500
for risk acceptance

629
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,230
questions

630
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,970
no now I just gave you guys so much

631
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:04,610
information I love this little girl she

632
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,990
reminds me of like the little mean our

633
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:09,320
little emoji so how do you make this

634
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,000
easier for yourself because I feel like

635
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,889
I just dumped a whole bunch of data on

636
00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:16,130
you and it's all very big it's up to

637
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,649
interpretation

638
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,720
because each business is different you

639
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,039
guys have different needs for your

640
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:25,820
vendors um so how do you make it easy

641
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,670
for yourself

642
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:31,030
well you can do that

643
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,970
but you gotta use automation so that

644
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,180
means that you have to have already kind

645
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,830
of know what you want to do with your

646
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,930
vendor risk management program it's not

647
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,730
something actually I'm sure you probably

648
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,830
could just kind of whip it together but

649
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,530
I would HIGHLY advise you kind of have

650
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:50,080
some sort of framework in place like you

651
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,090
have some sort of idea of what you want

652
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,820
to do and how you want to move because

653
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,880
automation it's gonna be difficult

654
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,320
you're gonna test it and try to figure

655
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,320
out what works for the business because

656
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,190
you always have to work with the

657
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,450
business and you don't want to make it

658
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,160
difficult for them because then they're

659
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,210
not going to want to do it

660
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:13,009
so the way I broke this out was there's

661
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:15,139
two aspects that you could use for

662
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,720
automation most the time people you know

663
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,340
when you say automation everybody

664
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,409
automatically thinks house or something

665
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:25,100
like that I did not go with that though

666
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,799
I went with operating system tools I

667
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:30,499
wanted to give you guys the capability

668
00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:32,749
to build an automation with what you

669
00:31:32,749 --> 00:31:35,389
have readily available I'm really

670
00:31:35,389 --> 00:31:37,460
mindful that not every organization

671
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,620
gives security a lot of money or

672
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,590
third-party risk a lot of money so we

673
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,629
have to be creative we have to use

674
00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:46,369
spreadsheets use Outlook

675
00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:48,470
we have to use whatever we have on our

676
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,169
computer to manage this research tools

677
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:55,970
whatever it may be so I have someone

678
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,820
here you can or cannot use them without

679
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,389
a word outlook powershell whatever you

680
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:07,009
want to use the world is your oyster but

681
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,950
it all starts with the idea so you'll

682
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:13,869
see I have a very very poorly drawn

683
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:16,460
diagram up here because I started

684
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,350
thinking of automation I was lucky

685
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:22,490
enough to have a SAS and I kind of was

686
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,320
able to build it from scratch and so

687
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,700
when I started thinking about how would

688
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,529
I make automation with stuff that I have

689
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,259
available to me I had to draw it out how

690
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:31,850
to think about it what I would be

691
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,470
telling you guys and what I would

692
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:36,379
propose so you need to know scoping you

693
00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:39,409
need to give the business a way to enter

694
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:42,049
the form that you want tell you what

695
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:43,820
kind of data will be transmitted whether

696
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,950
the vendor will store transmit process

697
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,720
all those details that I mentioned

698
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,450
before you need to provide them with a

699
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,389
way to give you that information but

700
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:54,619
then you need to receive that

701
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:57,649
information and security so how are you

702
00:32:57,649 --> 00:33:00,110
gonna get that and once you have that

703
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,850
information how are you gonna get it to

704
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,110
the vendor how are you gonna get the

705
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,999
assessment to them that needs to be

706
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:05,950
thought about

707
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,690
next how are you gonna get it back from

708
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,009
the vendor how are you gonna take those

709
00:33:12,009 --> 00:33:14,869
assessments and review it and look at

710
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:17,990
the findings and then finally what are

711
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,179
you gonna do with the results so all

712
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:21,950
those kind of key points that I talked

713
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:22,260
to

714
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,200
and obviously you can tailor it to your

715
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,910
organization depending on what you want

716
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,850
to see but this is kind of like kind of

717
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,530
get it thinking like what are you gonna

718
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,809
do like I said it all starts with an

719
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:37,020
idea that was not the first revision it

720
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:41,970
was multiple revisions of that okay so

721
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,580
now I'm gonna pull up a demo that

722
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:47,460
hopefully works

723
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,330
okay

724
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,090
are you guys familiar with teams at all

725
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,409
Microsoft teams

726
00:33:57,409 --> 00:34:02,359
I love teams I my company right now uses

727
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:05,590
it we have teams so locked-down

728
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,580
super collaborative lots of

729
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,040
functionality so organizations tend to

730
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,530
go between teams and slack or whatever

731
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,569
it may be but for the purposes of this

732
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:18,020
demo I use teams now I'm going to pause

733
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,969
it real quick

734
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:23,730
I did create this in SharePoint

735
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,760
I did create this in SharePoint - um

736
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,079
just to show you that you could use

737
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,790
SharePoint or you could use team

738
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,790
whatever you want you'll see that I had

739
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,918
built a forum in here so someone can

740
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:37,020
easily access it when we go back to team

741
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,549
so we're gonna look at that forum in a

742
00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:41,179
little more depth

743
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,260
okay now our team teams

744
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,570
I built this so anybody in my company

745
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,310
could go to this forum and start

746
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,590
answering questions so that first

747
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,570
question who is responsible for the

748
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,160
relationship with the vendor I just put

749
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:08,050
myself and who is the vendor I love the

750
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,970
office in fact I just went and watched

751
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,190
the office musical because I love it

752
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:15,250
that much so the business organization

753
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,220
responsible is dunder-mifflin and the

754
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,500
person completing the assessment will be

755
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,910
myself please explain the scope of

756
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:27,580
services the vendors providing now that

757
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,840
would be more elaborate than stuff but

758
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,300
you guys get the point

759
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,190
now will the vendor store transmit

760
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,470
and/or process data outside the company

761
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,780
a mark yes and I start answering these

762
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,670
other questions I'm going a little quick

763
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,070
but they're all the same questions that

764
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,470
I pointed out to you and scoping will

765
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,300
they have remote access will be

766
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,490
providing software as a service

767
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:57,500
and also what I'm noting you guys you

768
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,130
see a little thing after it yeah I made

769
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,830
those required questions so the business

770
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,720
goes in there they can't answer these

771
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,850
questions or they can't submit the form

772
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,890
without answering the questions those

773
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,990
questions are a must to be able to

774
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,690
evaluate the vendor

775
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:17,340
and then I'm gonna hit Smith

776
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:21,680
simple enough gives them an easy way to

777
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,940
let you know there's a vendor that you

778
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,300
need to evaluate um it didn't seem

779
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,880
overly complicated which was my goal I

780
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,520
didn't want to frustrate the business or

781
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,200
make it difficult for them to actually

782
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,350
do this work I want to make it like oh

783
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:39,450
those questions were easy to answer I

784
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,100
won't mind doing it the next time I have

785
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,100
a vendor

786
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,880
so now I will get that response to my

787
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,210
email

788
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,870
up in our handy little form it just says

789
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,550
you know you have a new scooping form

790
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,920
and you could click on it to view the

791
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,550
results

792
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,590
so you'll see right here I'm clicking on

793
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,290
it it took me 42 seconds to answer that

794
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,970
hopefully it's the person that really

795
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,790
does Caesar it takes a little bit longer

796
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,140
but it will show you all the statistics

797
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,540
as they relate to that question now for

798
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,970
the purposes of this demo I will open it

799
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:15,210
up in Excel because I'm gonna use macros

800
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,340
in Excel to make my life a little bit

801
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,790
easier with the automation

802
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:23,010
okay so this is the data that's all

803
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,200
pulled out now what I'm going to show

804
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,510
you is that I've built these forms

805
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,220
and essentially it's the same form that

806
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,340
you just saw but I'm putting it all in

807
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,100
one centralized location so you'll see

808
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,410
that you know this vendor has all their

809
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,770
data in there and I apologize this is my

810
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:45,080
V sites Cleveland vendor because I did

811
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,900
not update this video after I presented

812
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,600
there sorry I would have made you guys a

813
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,350
custom one but time got away from me I

814
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:56,630
have a questionnaire in here and I go

815
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,790
through the different categories like I

816
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:02,180
said before the control references come

817
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,440
straight from this cybersecurity

818
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,330
framework that's what's really nice

819
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:07,130
about that framework is they tell you

820
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:09,080
all the controls right there and what

821
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,180
they point to in relation to your

822
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,119
question so if anybody gives you issues

823
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:16,070
about it well it could be you to say

824
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,380
it's industry best practice those are

825
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,160
the tools you'll see that responses are

826
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,290
blank those will be populated and there

827
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:27,710
is my risk scoring my your scoring um

828
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:30,230
that's based on your organization so

829
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:34,130
very highs or twenty pies or tens

830
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:37,960
whatever you deem them to be

831
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,880
and next you'll see this is my scorecard

832
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,670
it's completely Bank blank because we

833
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,260
have not yet answered anything

834
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,410
so what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to

835
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,720
use a macro to import this data in my

836
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,740
centralized repository

837
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:58,400
you

838
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:01,920
you

839
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,630
so it's blank I'm going to just pull all

840
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,320
the data and

841
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,380
that is the vendor contact information

842
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,900
we will need that so now what we're

843
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,410
gonna do is email the vendor um the risk

844
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:19,320
assessment and what I also did if you

845
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,950
are sending out a lot of emails you

846
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:25,200
probably have your canned can you answer

847
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,130
this can you do this with in Outlook you

848
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,110
can create a macro that pulls up the

849
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,270
email the template with the attachment

850
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,130
all you got to do is throw the email

851
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,890
that you want it to go to so if you're

852
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,770
sending a lot of emails and you're just

853
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:43,260
constantly copy and pasting you can use

854
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,760
this as a method to kind of make your

855
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,670
life easier

856
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,789
so I have myself automatically cc'd but

857
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:51,319
you could see see the security group

858
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:53,930
whoever you want um you'll see it has an

859
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,519
attachment already in there and all I

860
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,460
gotta do is spin this will come to me

861
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,369
because obviously I'm just answering all

862
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:02,750
the questions and I'm doing the whole

863
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:07,450
demo it will take a minute to pop up

864
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,089
so now I'm going to open it up I am

865
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:14,380
pretending to be the vendor

866
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,600
and they do have to make it figure for

867
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,270
you because you cannot read little tiny

868
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,840
ant font

869
00:40:27,309 --> 00:40:30,359
even don't mind my little blackouts

870
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:32,499
there was some data there that you

871
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:35,249
should not see

872
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,410
you can name it whatever you want the

873
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,820
vendor is gonna name it whatever they

874
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,960
want

875
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,010
now we're going to go through the

876
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:47,490
questions does your company have a

877
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:50,250
vulnerability management program does

878
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,960
your company have a patch program in

879
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,930
place does your company maintain an

880
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,660
asset inventory all the questions that

881
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,670
we normally hear that we're accustomed

882
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,849
to seeing on a risk assessment nothing

883
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:06,059
too special but I will note do you guys

884
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:07,859
recall me saying provide them a little

885
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:10,040
more information so they can answer this

886
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,740
I provide additional information so if

887
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,900
they are unsure what you're getting at

888
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,569
what it means it's just a little blurb

889
00:41:18,569 --> 00:41:21,630
that they can read in the past when I

890
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:25,250
built this into a SAS what I did was

891
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,869
have a little information bubble so if

892
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:29,940
they cursed over it then they could see

893
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,530
the information and it all wasn't in

894
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,540
their face but I figured this was a good

895
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,259
alternative

896
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:42,960
do they have flow diagrams also another

897
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,569
really important one do they have an

898
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:48,000
information security policy a lot of

899
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,230
companies do not surprisingly all right

900
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,400
so now I'm gonna go through the

901
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,720
responses I'm gonna answer them just

902
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,880
like the vendor would hopefully your

903
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,780
vendor provides a response to the stuff

904
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,549
that they marked no so that way you have

905
00:42:05,549 --> 00:42:08,790
a good idea of what they're doing if not

906
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,049
you'll just have to communicate with

907
00:42:10,049 --> 00:42:15,990
them I am going to skip that because I

908
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:21,059
think you guys understand okay so now I

909
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:23,549
am going to email the vendor or I'm

910
00:42:23,549 --> 00:42:25,230
sorry email myself at the risk

911
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,900
assessment questionnaire you can also

912
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,030
use macros to pull out that assessment

913
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,520
and put it into a folder that you want

914
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,740
to store it in so it's really important

915
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,420
that we're keeping all these things in

916
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,290
one central location so it's easier to

917
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:45,270
deal with so now you can click on the

918
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,010
attachment save it or whatever but you

919
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:50,750
stuff to take all the steps to do it

920
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,000
what I'm going to do is just hit this

921
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,420
save mackerel save attachment macro that

922
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,690
I've created and now that attachment

923
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,670
goes to the place that I've stored it

924
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,140
and I can still open it from that

925
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,500
location

926
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,400
all right so now I have their responses

927
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,960
what am I gonna do now well I'm gonna

928
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,420
put it back into my little central

929
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,119
repository that I want for that vendor

930
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:20,800
so that way if I ever have any questions

931
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,810
about the one particular vendor I can

932
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:25,730
both their data

933
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:27,790
you

934
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:35,290
all right now

935
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,849
right here you'll see that I

936
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:39,890
automatically did the scoring so the

937
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:42,859
logic was built in that if they answer

938
00:43:42,859 --> 00:43:45,109
yes they got zero points but if they had

939
00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:47,779
no they got the points associated with

940
00:43:47,779 --> 00:43:50,630
that risk score so now they have a total

941
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,599
of 11 depending on your organization

942
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,750
that may be okay again it goes back to

943
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,359
whatever you guys decide or works best

944
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,599
for you now here it populated my

945
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:05,240
scorecard it gave them a risk grade of

946
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,569
medium and I also want to pull in those

947
00:44:08,569 --> 00:44:11,690
identified risk so like I mentioned

948
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,859
before we want to make sure the business

949
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:15,230
understands what all those risk are or

950
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,720
at least they know of them so this is a

951
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:22,549
very like very very tuned down version

952
00:44:22,549 --> 00:44:24,230
of a scorecard but it gives you the

953
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:27,940
general idea of what you can do

954
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,880
so now what I'm also gonna do is just

955
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,440
make it into a PDF and um when I clicked

956
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,150
on that macro up there it saved it to a

957
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,729
PDF to my desktop so now I have it ready

958
00:44:40,729 --> 00:44:43,989
to give to whoever

959
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,180
now granted if you were doing these on a

960
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,590
one-by-one basis

961
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,300
creating that PDF probably would be

962
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,700
super easy but I'm talking about you're

963
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,070
doing like 30 assessments a day you're

964
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:55,750
doing like you're looking at a whole lot

965
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,760
of them what are these little tiny

966
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,530
things that we can do just to minimize

967
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,930
the impact to your day and kind of make

968
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:04,790
your date your life a little bit easier

969
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:07,570
so but you'll see right here before I

970
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:10,820
paused it you'll see now that that patch

971
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:14,300
minute is already on my desktop I'll

972
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,010
click it open and I'll be the same data

973
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:20,480
that was just on the sport card in the

974
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,130
spreadsheet

975
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:25,230
and not very pretty

976
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,950
and that is that

977
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:32,030
oh well thank you thank you so much

978
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,970
all right let me get this down again

979
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,020
because there's still more to my

980
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:41,080
presentation all right so the demo

981
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:46,730
really like very very basic stuff what

982
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:48,440
I'm trying to get at though is you could

983
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,210
be really creative of what you have and

984
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:52,790
make something that works for you um

985
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:55,130
make your life a little bit easier you

986
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,620
know work on it an hour a day till you

987
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:01,400
figure out what works all right does

988
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,960
anybody have any questions about third

989
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,460
party risk management because I'm gonna

990
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,350
flip to the other side I'm going to talk

991
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:08,090
about the people that you're assessing

992
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:09,920
or if you're one of the people being

993
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,690
assessed a lot so any questions on third

994
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:15,110
party yeah yoy

995
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:18,290
all right so we're burst third party

996
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:21,230
risk management um my boss and I came up

997
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:23,660
with this title because we couldn't

998
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,910
quite figure out what to call it now

999
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:28,490
everybody's always so concerned about

1000
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:32,180
assessing their third parties which you

1001
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,470
should be you should be very concerned

1002
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:35,870
about that but what about the flipside

1003
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:37,970
what about the people that are

1004
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:40,550
constantly being assessed because now

1005
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,350
they're getting bogged down with a lot

1006
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:44,300
of questionnaires and that they really

1007
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,190
want to try to get them answered it's

1008
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:48,580
just I don't know how to manage them so

1009
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:51,320
this question always comes up and I

1010
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,450
never have a good answer I'm sorry I

1011
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:56,960
apologize now but the purpose of reverse

1012
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,150
third party management is to reduce the

1013
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,310
burden of inbound questionnaires so they

1014
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,530
don't want to just not answer them they

1015
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:04,970
still want to answer them but how do

1016
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:06,830
they reduce that burden so they can

1017
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:09,530
answer those questions and appropriate

1018
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,420
time frame because you guys don't want

1019
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,370
to be wait in two weeks and they don't

1020
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:16,160
want to be sitting on it forever

1021
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,980
next you want to they want to minimize

1022
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,080
their response time so again they don't

1023
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,220
want to be sitting on it for weeks

1024
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,590
because they realize if they sit on it a

1025
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,330
long time that could be impacting the

1026
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:27,680
business moving forward with that

1027
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,950
relationship and so if you are in a

1028
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:32,750
position where you need to put in third

1029
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,700
party risk management reverse their

1030
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,110
party risk management you should build

1031
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:37,670
it in conjunction with your current

1032
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:40,040
governance documents so that way when

1033
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,990
you get the questions in you can start

1034
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:44,480
aligning to what you already do now

1035
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,850
there are some frameworks or I'm sorry

1036
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:52,090
industries are high tress let me just

1037
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:54,600
use that example I trust recently

1038
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,890
hospitals that have hydro certification

1039
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:58,690
are pushing for their third parties to

1040
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:00,970
get that kind of makes it a little bit

1041
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:03,130
easier because now okay we're all in the

1042
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,840
same playing field we all know that we

1043
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,030
need to get high trust now granted high

1044
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:09,340
trust is a beast and there are so many

1045
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,200
things they have to deal with in it but

1046
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,630
now your third parties know what they

1047
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:15,640
need to do and there's no question

1048
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,960
around it they just have to get

1049
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,680
certified

1050
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,590
it's in my pain but it I mean it kind of

1051
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:21,910
makes life a little bit easier because

1052
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:24,760
right now your third parties are getting

1053
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,610
questionnaires from 50 different people

1054
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:30,010
and they're trying to answer them all

1055
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:32,860
and it's difficult unfortunately on

1056
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,200
their side they haven't quite grasped

1057
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,850
the concept that they need a third party

1058
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:39,250
management office if you're offering

1059
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,620
services to somebody you need to make

1060
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,210
sure that you're ready to answer those

1061
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:44,770
questions when they come in on how

1062
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:46,540
you're going to protect the data so

1063
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,240
third party risk management people have

1064
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,400
those questions through that in here so

1065
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,870
hopefully if anybody in the audience

1066
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:56,920
this is that sort of position then maybe

1067
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,240
we could talk about it a little bit more

1068
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,879
if not then it's all good

1069
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:08,100
and now the wrap-up you can reach me at

1070
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,010
any of these I don't really use the

1071
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:13,500
Twitter a whole lot I do have a handle

1072
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,960
though because you should have that and

1073
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,000
security apparently I don't like the

1074
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,650
interwebs

1075
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:22,680
apparently I have Layton and I have

1076
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,350
email which I always answer because I do

1077
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:26,580
use my email

1078
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:31,530
unfortunately for work oh yeah I hope

1079
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:34,170
you guys leave a little more aware about

1080
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:36,600
what third-party risk is and how you

1081
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,300
should be managing it and hopefully I'm

1082
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,740
able to answer any questions that you

1083
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:44,820
may have it's all subjective when you

1084
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,530
think about what your organization needs

1085
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:49,800
so um like I help you think about it a

1086
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,990
little bit then I did my job

1087
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:56,080
alright thank you guys

1088
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,469
[Applause]
