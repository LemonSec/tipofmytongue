started everybody thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all for</font>

2
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,460
attending I appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it i'm really</font>

3
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,510
really excited about this particular

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:29,270
piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of research i did just as a quick</font>

00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:34,340
who i am but this work was performed by

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,470
myself and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Richard Hilgers Richard's not</font>

00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,550
joint<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort it's just I'm presenting it</font>

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,950
so that's kind of what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's</font>

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,839
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're going to be</font>

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,970
talking about today is when you move to

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">the cloud you you give up a certain</font>

16
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:55,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of security visibility and I did</font>

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,350
a full analysis and research on how much

18
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:58,940
of that visibility you lose and how much

19
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,780
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> retain and how you would retain</font>

20
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:05,089
and that's what I'm presenting today

21
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:08,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so a quick little Who am I seems to</font>

wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that afterwards I'd</font>

34
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:36,530
love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about it my research focus</font>

35
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,240
for my dissertation is going to be

lightweight functional cybersecurity

frameworks for small businesses it's a

38
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:46,490
huge gap for multiple reasons but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

39
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,290
not the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this talk I have a wife</font>

40
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">and two kids which makes me a husband</font>

and the father and I'm very very proud

42
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,689
of that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> after this if anyone wants</font>

43
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:57,169
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a beer i'm also down for that</font>

44
00:01:53,689 --> 00:02:00,110
because i love craft beer big<font color="#CCCCCC"> old fan so</font>

45
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,520
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

46
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,100
want you guys waiting and trepidation

47
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,360
for like what are the results gonna be I

48
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,429
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present it up front and</font>

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,410
then I'll deep dive into you know how I

50
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:12,950
got there or how we got there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

51
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:15,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatnot so basically all federal</font>

52
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,119
agencies right now are having to look at

53
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,029
cloud and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll explain why in a minute</font>

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,820
but there's a there's a lot of research

55
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:25,250
around cloud security because it's it's

56
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,930
fairly new<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd say like in the last you</font>

57
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,010
know five or six years<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of</font>

58
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,540
taken hold and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> being forced</font>

59
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,070
the research that we use leverage as

60
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,049
well documented standards this is

61
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,160
basically nest I know you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

62
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,740
mentioned that you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,570
space<font color="#E5E5E5"> already like NIST is basically</font>

64
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,820
what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is they're defining what</font>

65
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:45,760
security controls what we're going to

66
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:49,720
see today is that basically when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

67
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,880
move up into the cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your IT you</font>

68
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,440
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> only going to be able to have nine</font>

69
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,060
percent visibility of the security

70
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,960
control so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually lose ninety-one</font>

71
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:01,390
percent of the visibility of the NIST

72
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,580
minimum security requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> also i</font>

73
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,589
should note like we use the moderate

74
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,280
security baseline as our standard it

75
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,690
seems you know to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the standard</font>

76
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,250
no one wants to go high because it's

77
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,150
like too many controls and no one wants

78
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,140
to say low because that would mean that

79
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:19,210
their systems not important<font color="#E5E5E5"> so good who</font>

80
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,070
didn't you guys did yeah yeah yeah well

81
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:23,110
they support it it's just like as a p.o

82
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,760
like no one no one wants to say hi cuz

83
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,970
then you have to add<font color="#E5E5E5"> additional cannot</font>

84
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean it's a political thing so so nine</font>

85
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,390
percent of the controls you have and

86
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,820
then twenty-seven percent we went one

87
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:39,130
layer lower and actually looked at it

88
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,359
like control objectives so in will get

89
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,760
in this in a second but controls are

90
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,020
broken up<font color="#E5E5E5"> into multiple objectives so we</font>

91
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,880
were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to determine that one</font>

92
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,620
objective or two objectives out of

93
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,200
saying the collection of five objectives

94
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:53,290
were accessible we captured<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as well</font>

95
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,019
just to kind of understand if you could

96
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,070
get pieces of certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> controls so we're</font>

97
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,890
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find that twenty-seven percent</font>

98
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,690
of those controls are visible so the key

99
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,369
takeaway if you walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> away from this talk</font>

100
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,640
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing it's that moving to the</font>

101
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,960
cloud has a real situational awareness

102
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:13,170
costs associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too like what</font>

103
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:16,420
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security of your program really is</font>

104
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay lit review a bit of a background</font>

105
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,320
for those who are not familiar with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

106
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,800
know there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us here that are</font>

107
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,430
but I want to address this piece so 2002

108
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">fisma gets passed by W and if the</font>

109
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,640
federal Information Security Management

110
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,010
Act and basically what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

111
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:36,400
law that says all federal agencies have

112
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:40,030
to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimum security standard</font>

113
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,210
applied to their IT systems it's huge

114
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,530
and

115
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,409
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cost a lot of money it's</font>

116
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,448
gonna take time Congress and Petur<font color="#CCCCCC"> FISMA</font>

117
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,740
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> Congress and powers NIST the</font>

118
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:52,190
National Institute of Standards and

119
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,900
Technology to come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> what like how</font>

120
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,520
what these standards are what this

121
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,849
information security is going to look

122
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,039
like for these federal IT programs this

123
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:03,860
is 2005 clouds not really big yet you

124
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,360
know you got these huge data centers

125
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,819
they got there buddy got their own IT

126
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,229
and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big deal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this keeps</font>

127
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:13,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trucking and that's fine well in 2010</font>

128
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:17,650
clouds starting to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the scene and</font>

129
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:22,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">Vivek Kundra who was the first u.s.</font>

130
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:24,919
federal chief information officer with a

131
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:27,620
consortium conceived the idea of FedRAMP

132
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:30,530
and FedRAMP is basically kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like a</font>

133
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:33,949
clearinghouse for cloud service

134
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:35,599
providers to engage with federal

135
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:39,080
agencies and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that in a</font>

136
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:41,449
second but the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

137
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,780
approved cloud service provider grouping

138
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:47,120
is what FedRAMP is Vivek then goes on in

139
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,888
issues in 2011 the cloud first policy

140
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,330
its got like a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> long bureaucratic</font>

141
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:53,060
name but people<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it the cloud first</font>

142
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:55,460
policy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what this policy</font>

143
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,940
dictates is that any federal IT program

144
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,948
is required to first evaluate a cloud

145
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:05,870

<font color="#E5E5E5">to spend funds building an in-house</font>

147
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,539
solution so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to stand up a</font>

148
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:10,729
new program for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Marine Corps or</font>

149
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:13,190
something like that before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can just</font>

150
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:15,020
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy hardware and put you know mount</font>

151
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server racks up and get going you</font>

152
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:20,210
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> demonstrate that you considered</font>

153
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,320
a cloud solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> first and I mean</font>

154
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,669
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get around that you</font>

155
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,860
could say oh it doesn't work whatever

156
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:27,320
but like the idea is that the government

157
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:31,969
is now dictating that cloud is going to

158
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:33,740
be seriously considered 2011 FedRAMP

159
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:34,940
gets some teeth they define a policy

160
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,099
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how it's going to work so in</font>

161
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,449
2010 there's coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with an idea</font>

162
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:41,900
they're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how is going to</font>

163
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:44,000
work 2011 they actually state the policy

164
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,530
and in 2012 they actually launched

165
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,719
FedRAMP and this is under the second

166
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">federal CIO I forget his name but they</font>

167
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:51,949
launched it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now it's like it's a</font>

168
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:53,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">clearinghouse things are cloud service</font>

169
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:54,650
providers are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being evaluated against</font>

170
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:57,139
criteria

171
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:59,000
federal agencies can go to FedRAMP and

172
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:00,560
basically shop for cloud service

173
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,330
providers it's it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

174
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,340
interesting and worthwhile endeavor 2017

175
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,948
so this is based on I pulled this

176
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:14,330
yesterday FedRAMP projections for next

177
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:16,490
year they're expecting to have 750<font color="#CCCCCC"> atos</font>

178
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,440
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> are authority to operate they're</font>

179
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,750
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> offering 150 cloud services</font>

180
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,699
that federal agencies can shop and then

181
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,380
this and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting and</font>

182
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:29,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">we who's worked in the federal IT space</font>

183
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:31,310
they are basically declaring that from

184
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,419
the moment that you show up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

185
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,190
moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have a provisional</font>

186
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:37,099
authority to operate it should take six

187
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,440
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is huge like usually an</font>

188
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,910
ato is you know two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like you</font>

189
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,590
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> never get it you get an interim</font>

190
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:46,490
ato or you just filled it and just hope

191
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:48,500
for the best so that's kind of like

192
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:54,259
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on the deal I guess the</font>

193
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:56,539
deal is cloud is being widely adopted by

194
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:57,560
the federal government okay but I'm

195
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:59,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about what the risk</font>

196
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,330
is their associated with it okay so okay

197
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:05,090
so for those you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

198
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:07,609
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> quote unquote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FISMA process it's</font>

199
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,349
a six step process step one takes just a

200
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,360
mini two categories what's in there step

201
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:13,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">two you select your controls step 3</font>

202
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,810
implement your controls now this is why

203
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:19,610
the FedRAMP and going cloud is such a

204
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:22,159
benefit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and time-saving and cost savings</font>

205
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:25,010
because we'll use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon for an example</font>

206
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:26,990
AWS is already implemented the controls

207
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:29,030
we said earlier that step 2 everybody's

208
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,500
using moderate for the most part step

209
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">three is you're implementing the troll</font>

210
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,229
as well amazon has already done it for

211
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,080
you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do some anyhow for</font>

212
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:38,150
yourself but the IT infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

213
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,830
already done for you by amazon and the

214
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,779
assessment piece which takes I mean

215
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,940
that's you know four months probably to

216
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:45,350
have you don't auto-tune come in all

217
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">that stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so amazon has already done</font>

218
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,650
that and then the authorization<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

219
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:50,540
provisional<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 other we just talked</font>

220
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,890
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> from start to six months that's</font>

221
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,719
what's happening there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font>

222
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,819
monitor is just you know continuous

223
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,390
monitoring standard order of business so

224
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:01,610
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the overall process I will no</font>

225
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,959
step<font color="#E5E5E5"> for where you're assessing your</font>

226
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,320
having that audit you're having that

227
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,469
visibility this is where you're losing

228
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,850
it by adopting

229
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,890
because you can't and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

230
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:16,370
can't you can't scan you can't go look

231
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:19,130
at AWS and sag<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is the</font>

232
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:23,030
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> statement and I should have</font>

233
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:25,250
backed this up one step this this

234
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:29,900
problem this this issue was brought to

235
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:31,610
me last year while in capacity of dakota

236
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,579
state university by a federal agency

237
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:37,250
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> said hey we want to go cloud but we</font>

238
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,450
don't know what kind of security<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk</font>

239
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,100
there is like do you want to take this

240
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,870
on as a research project and that's why

241
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">i worked with the fellow from purdue on</font>

242
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,610
it because it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the academic think so</font>

243
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,010
as you can see at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top this is you</font>

244
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:50,750
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and be on the top this is</font>

245
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,900
what the current traditional thing is so

246
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:57,080
you know this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> represents</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our agency</font>

247
00:09:53,900 --> 00:10:00,199
so in a classic situation you build your

248
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,670
own IT infrastructure right you select

249
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">your controls you apply the controls</font>

250
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:07,130
with your own personnel on your own IT

251
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,240
you assess it yourself and then you know

252
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,830
you get your authority<font color="#CCCCCC"> operate and you</font>

253
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,690
use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you have complete control over</font>

254
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:17,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">it in the FedRAMP world what happens is</font>

255
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:20,510
you take advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of AWS for example</font>

256
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:23,150
for AWS to get that provisional<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATO</font>

257
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:26,120
FedRAMP authorizes a third-party

258
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,500
organization so it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone it</font>

259
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,120
could be booze down it could be Joe's

260
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,340
consulting it does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean you</font>

261
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,360
have to be accredited to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do</font>

262
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">it there's a process for that but</font>

263
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,810
basically some third-party that's

264
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,000
unrelated to the federal<font color="#CCCCCC"> government or</font>

265
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,229
the agency that's getting it assesses it

266
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,960
and says it's good to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and that's how</font>

267
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,430
they get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ATO so basically the</font>

268
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,470
federal agency just goes ahead and

269
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:48,469
starts using it but they have no

270
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,750
visibility into that security so what

271
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,040
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done here is basically the slide</font>

272
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just going along is just push the</font>

273
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,920
top down what we've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is this</font>

274
00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:00,140
yellow arrow is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> result of the work</font>

275
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,430
if that nine percent for the total

276
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">control is twenty-seven percent for the</font>

277
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:07,699
partial controls they can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

278
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:10,220
security visibility so kind of a layout

279
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:15,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the before and in the after if you</font>

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:17,870
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay just some common language as I</font>

controls based on what your baseline is

287
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:37,470
it tells you what controls you need this

288
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:39,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">is PE 18 it's a physical control this</font>

289
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,220
element right here in green is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

290
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,570
control itself they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> required to</font>

291
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,460
implement this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> moderate baseline</font>

292
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,230
this element right here is a control

293
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:49,980
enhancement it speaks directly to this

294
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:51,870
control but for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> research we kind of</font>

295
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,610
this is a separate control because it is

296
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible even though it enhances this it</font>

297
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,870
is possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this control to be in</font>

298
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,860
place it and this control not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be in</font>

299
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,760
place so we didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose</font>

300
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:06,240
visibility over that so there's 161

301
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,800
total controls and there's 164 control

302
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,040
enhancements for a security moderate

303
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:13,020
baseline so 325 controls so use the term

304
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,550
control loosely because it includes

305
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:20,640
control enhancements as well just for

306
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:22,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">the taxonomy of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> missy 153 there's 18</font>

307
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,740
control families within each control

308
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:27,569
there are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it depends on the</font>

309
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,030
family but there are group of controls

310
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:32,550
with enhancements and then for each

311
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:35,640
control there are seven sub objectives

312
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:39,780
and that's how you assess the control

313
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:42,870
itself hopefully this is clear and not

314
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:45,290
muddy so I just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find this</font>

315
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:48,180
because we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this so</font>

316
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:50,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the the method the procedure</font>

317
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:54,540
with which we did this research we<font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

318
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,700
an exploratory approach so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we</font>

319
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:00,329
dug in we got you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> super Excel</font>

320
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,770
document with like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3200 rose basically</font>

321
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,450
every assessment objective and we went

322
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:08,430
through you know line by line

323
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:11,520
effectively we did make some well we

324
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:14,430
used 853 a rav4 which is the companion

325
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,850
document 2 853 which basically defines

326
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:20,819
how the the controls are going to be

327
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:22,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">assessed so it's like it's a common</font>

328
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,320
approach to assess in the controls<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

329
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,730
so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind choosing that is it's</font>

330
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,590
not me just coming up with all way to

331
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,610
test it it's a it's a well-defined way

332
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,950
that way if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else wanted to</font>

333
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:34,850
repeat this research

334
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:37,970
or or call it disputed if you know we'd

335
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:41,630
have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to base it off of there</font>

336
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:43,820
were so there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3200</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rose right but</font>

337
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,140
there's a at the beginning instead of

338
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,610
going through every one line by line we

339
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">tried to make some intelligent decisions</font>

340
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:52,160
right up front to filter out a lot of

341
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:53,390
that noise so in 853 rub three of you

342
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">familiar with that the controls were</font>

343
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:58,760
actually grouped categorically by

344
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,860
managerial technical or administrative

345
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,860
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> taken</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it out of red for but the</font>

346
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,210
idea behind it still<font color="#E5E5E5"> applies so we went</font>

347
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,460
through and looked at all the managerial

348
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,960
controls and just remove them right away

349
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,640
because there's no way you can test it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

350
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,160
managerial control for example would be

351
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:16,600
that there's a line item budget for

352
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:19,189
information security in the annual

353
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,510
financials for the program right like

354
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:24,230
we're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you there's no way</font>

355
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:25,520
from an end-user perspective I don't

356
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,440
know if I said this<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the beginning the</font>

357
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:31,310
whole point of this is what can you look

358
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:34,540
at from the outside of a of a cloud

359
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:36,319
service provider that you can test so

360
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,670
managerial controls you're not Camille

361
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,480
test you're not gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to know if</font>

362
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:42,890
they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing and user awareness</font>

363
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,780
training like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not going to</font>

364
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:51,410
be able to know that administrative

365
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:53,060
controls or administrative<font color="#E5E5E5"> amandera</font>

366
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,990
there was almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same I guess I met</font>

367
00:14:53,060 --> 00:15:00,020
more operational controls there where

368
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:03,470
are they reviewing audit logs weekly you

369
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:05,510
know if there's a if someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets</font>

370
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,580
terminated do they collect the laptop or

371
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,110
the keys or disable their account<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

372
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,580
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just you can't test those</font>

373
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,010
things so we were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly</font>

374
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,200
eliminate let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-thirds of the</font>

375
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,819
controls right away then we took those

376
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,730
technical controls<font color="#E5E5E5"> around standing we</font>

377
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:23,150
went through one at a time using 853 a

378
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:25,250
rav4 as the assessment procedure and

379
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,410
said instead like based on this

380
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:30,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">assessment procedure is it possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

381
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:32,600
test this control external to the cloud

382
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,310
service provider and if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was yes then</font>

383
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,870
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> captured it if it was no we captured</font>

384
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:41,569
it as such<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this corresponds to</font>

385
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,500
what i said in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> executive summary 30</font>

386
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:48,420
controls we found be completely

387
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,980
accessible accessible 89 controls we

388
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,079
found to be partially accessible and

389
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,640
this is inclusive so this 89 includes is

390
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,530
30 because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's partially accessible</font>

391
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:58,170
and it's completely accessible than its

392
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:01,140
partially accessible these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 18</font>

393
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:05,069
control families that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned I've</font>

394
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:08,520
got some fancy graphics right here these

395
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:10,200
light blue ones you'll see these are

396
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,230
controlled families and their associated

397
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,510
controls<font color="#CCCCCC"> column C key is complete</font>

398
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:17,730
control count for that control family CA

399
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:21,120
is completely assessable PA is partially

400
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,530
accessible you'll note<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these</font>

401
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,170
control families that are highlighted

402
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:27,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">have no completely accessible know</font>

403
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,280
partially accessible so and it makes

404
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,660
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> right awareness and awareness and</font>

405
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,339
trying to week there's no way to test

406
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,719
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not they're doing awareness</font>

407
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,390
training personnel security this is

408
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,520
around terminations and background

409
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:41,189

vendors to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're receiving</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the administrative documentation we</font>

414
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,690
can't test that from the outside

415
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:04,109
yeah I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> how would you test that I</font>

416
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:05,849
mean you can't yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you're like</font>

417
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:09,178
you're you're you're you're sitting at

418
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:12,208
like Starbucks right and but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

419
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:16,020
it's your you know your cut your program

420
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:18,780
is using Amazon AWS what controls could

421
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,010
you could you test like granted it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

422
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,559
a control that they do have the

423
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:24,510
documentation but I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess you</font>

424
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,158
could pick up a phone and call and say

425
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,419
you know hey like I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> curious do</font>

426
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:29,820
you have documentation they could tell

427
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:31,380
you yes or no you wouldn't you wouldn't

428
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,730
be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say with confidence whether</font>

429
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,400
the person's telling you the truth or

430
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,470
not and then be I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if they</font>

431
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,909
would tell you um you know they might

432
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">want say who are you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what you know</font>

433
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,090
correct yeah and now and that was the

434
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:51,120
that was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem statement</font>

435
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,770
positioned by the three-letter agency

436
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,840
that came came to us with the problem

437
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,210
they said we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go cloud but we</font>

438
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,610
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to know what we can continue to</font>

439
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,840
check like basically they're paranoid

440
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,820
and they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to just take it at</font>

441
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:08,850
face value that AWS is going to

442
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:12,450
implement their controls yep sure sure

443
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:15,209
so um great point when I said earlier

444
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:17,159
that we I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of categorically broke it</font>

445
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:20,010
out by administrative managerial and

446
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:21,659
technical there was a fourth field that

447
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:25,049
wasn't in<font color="#E5E5E5"> rev3 that we found it to be</font>

448
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:27,750
obvious which was physical security

449
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:33,510
controls so we did make the<font color="#E5E5E5"> assumption</font>

450
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:35,490
that as a consumer of AWS services that

451
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:38,370
it would be reasonable that you could

452
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,690
request a site visit and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font>

453
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,520
be granted that so you could walk around

454
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you could verify that there is fire</font>

455
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,879
extinguishers and that there's lock ages

456
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,909
in that base they check badges and stuff

457
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:52,140
like that you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that assumption</font>

458
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:53,350
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've asacol banner right or data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

459
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,059
underfed ramping

460
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,760
as our packaging everything so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

461
00:18:55,059 --> 00:19:00,129
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see their full SSP scheme every bit</font>

462
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,750
of detail right they still won't tell me

463
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:06,340
where my data center actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> is haha</font>

464
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,840
and part of my assessment packages been

465
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,668
like they wear these things located

466
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,490
those told me to controls around them i

467
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:14,340
would say where could i go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this data</font>

468
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,690
center they won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even give me a hand</font>

469
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,110
interesting they will not do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

470
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:22,000
full access to their again there oh yeah

471
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:24,490
no I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I understand what you're saying and</font>

472
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was an assumption we made like I</font>

473
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:31,179
said the logic was that um you know like

474
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,949
director Comey could be like hey I want

475
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:36,520
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it or you know give this guy a</font>

476
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:38,590
walkthrough yeah but I mean we just made

477
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,658
an assumption that you could request<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

478
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,740
and you would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> granting cuz the idea</font>

479
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:43,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">was that like they're trying to sell</font>

480
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,010
their services so it's not an

481
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,320
unrealistic request to have a

482
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:49,990
walkthrough um I mean it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds like</font>

483
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,000
maybe it is in practice but I mean I've

484
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,730
never gotten<font color="#CCCCCC"> a walkthrough about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

485
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,650
cloud service provider but so okay well

486
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:59,559
then maybe this research needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

487
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,840
adjusted slightly yeah but but for this

488
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:03,070
current position we've made the

489
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,658
assumption that you can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a data</font>

490
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:07,590
center walkthrough and all that's going

491
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:12,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to grant you is visual inspection of</font>

492
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:14,949
physical security controls yeah

493
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:19,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">terremark in Virginia will do it yeah I</font>

494
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:22,230
mean there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> microphones yeah yeah</font>

495
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:26,289
amazon<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at Hydra</font>

496
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:29,110
yeah I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten Amazon's on package</font>

497
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:30,640
through Gao and it's you got to go

498
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,139
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of hurdles to get it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

499
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,210
then they've got to those able partner

500
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,640
packaging they have a even further

501
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:40,999
additional packages it you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get any</font>

502
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:45,729
better does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

503
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:52,609
rather the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> sex is like Google very</font>

504
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:53,659
sure mm-hmm um well this physical thing

505
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:55,309
is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

506
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:58,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there's another subset of</font>

507
00:20:55,309 --> 00:21:05,029
controls that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we capture but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

508
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:07,549
just it's the next slide so these these

509
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:10,459
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bulk control families that we</font>

510
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:11,749
kind of identified as as accessible from

511
00:21:10,459 --> 00:21:13,729
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-user perspective it's not</font>

512
00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:15,529
complete but you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the</font>

513
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:18,109
physical one as we just kind of talked

514
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:20,629
about access control and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I na that's</font>

515
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:21,799
around user accounts and since you're

516
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:23,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to have full visibility over</font>

517
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:27,319
the admin accounts at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the aw that the</font>

518
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:30,859
AWS staff have but you will have an

519
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:32,149
account into amazon so you can kind of

520
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:33,468
test some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things like session</font>

521
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:35,389
lock and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pat like try to put a stupid</font>

522
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:37,459
password and stuff like that and then

523
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:39,738
the SC control family that's around the

524
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:41,419
network communication transmission and

525
00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:44,149
since you are establishing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a connection</font>

526
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:48,279
with whoever the cloud service provider

527
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:50,839
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of look at that</font>

528
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:52,099
connection and evaluated is it encrypted

529
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:57,198
what level of encryption these type of

530
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:58,908
things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I highlighted this and we'll</font>

531
00:21:57,199 --> 00:22:02,059
spend a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about it now</font>

532
00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:04,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember the research was what controls</font>

533
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:07,639
are accessible we didn't actually assess

534
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:09,609
them in but if you if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font>

535
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:11,688
you say is this control accessible

536
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:13,639
contingency planning controls are

537
00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:16,309
accessible in that do they have an

538
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:19,129
alternate data center if you bring down

539
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:20,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">their production facility in there and</font>

540
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,759
another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes up then that controls</font>

541
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:24,529
in place so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> technically you can</font>

542
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:27,019
test it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a black box perspective</font>

543
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:28,969
should you test it probably not because

544
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:30,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's probably not a good idea and we</font>

545
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:32,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">found you know six controls to</font>

546
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,189
completely for partially and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give</font>

547
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:37,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">it a couple examples in here but we</font>

548
00:22:34,189 --> 00:22:39,589
called those Red Team Black team

549
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:43,369
controls that are accessible because you

550
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:44,869
would need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to perform well on the Black</font>

551
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:47,718
<font color="#CCCCCC">team side I mean you'd have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to like</font>

552
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:49,458
actually attack them um there's a couple

553
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:51,720
other controls that were red team

554
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:53,100
accessible for example like maintenance

555
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,400
maintenance<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think its maintenance</font>

556
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,860
where there's a control hey guys there's

557
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,030
a control where you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically tools</font>

558
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,559
need to be inspected when they're

559
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:03,260
brought into a facility no one's allowed

560
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:06,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">to take hardware out of the facility</font>

561
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:09,090
without approval and things like that

562
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:12,600
well technically assuming that you can

563
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:16,230
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that physical walkthrough or you own</font>

564
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:18,539
a UPS outfit you could test that control

565
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,770
by attempting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring in something into</font>

566
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:22,379
facility and see if it gets inspected

567
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,309
again you know your mileage may vary you

568
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,929
might want to have a rules of engagement

569
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:27,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">or kind of set it up but it is</font>

570
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:28,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">assessable it's more of a social</font>

571
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:33,840
engineering attack or a physical attack

572
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:35,820
than it is a technical attack I just got

573
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,320
another slide here that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of drives</font>

574
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:41,280
home the point of the red<font color="#CCCCCC"> team and black</font>

575
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,870
team the first bullet I mean you could

576
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,820
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could steal someone's laptop right a</font>

577
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,979
guy comes out or drops a USB you could

578
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:50,220
take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from them not advise that you</font>

579
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:53,669
could do it to check that I already set

580
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:56,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inspect tools and the Black team one</font>

581
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:57,120
you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> Doss you know like basically</font>

582
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,678
what just happened on the eastern

583
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,840
seaboard you could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and see if</font>

584
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:04,799
they were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintain up time</font>

585
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:09,570
during that attack again I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

586
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:13,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">it but you can test it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

587
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:17,158
as i mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> i use 53a or reused like</font>

588
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:20,460
I guess keep saying we we use 53a as the

589
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:22,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">catalog for assessment procedures so if</font>

590
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,240
you went beyond that if you expanded

591
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:26,760
beyond 53a and thought of other kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

592
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">innovative ways and approaches to test a</font>

593
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,090
control you might be able to expand the

594
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,390
scope of the security controls that are

595
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:34,949
accessible from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the unused perspective i</font>

596
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,960
mentioned ridin Black team essentially

597
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:41,340
you know you can assess it but it's

598
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:44,820
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a good idea um internal</font>

599
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:47,399
versus external so those AC controls and

600
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,168
IA controls<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned that's assuming</font>

601
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,760
you have in a like someone's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

602
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:52,950
admin account that can access the

hypervisor level of your AWS instance

604
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:58,530
right well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon staff that they're</font>

605
00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:00,870
privileged users their domain accounts

606
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:02,309
and stuff like that that's managing your

607
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,000
environment you won't have visibility

608
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:05,680
into that so it is fees

609
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,570
all that you know you've got tight

610
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,780
controls on your user accounts but they

611
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:11,860
have loose controls on theirs and I keep

612
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,470
picking on Amazon they're probably

613
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:16,689
pretty you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume pretty good</font>

00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:19,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">because of such a big animal but there</font>

are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know 60 or 70 cloud service</font>

616
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,900
providers that FedRAMP has approved and

617
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,280
some of them are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really tiny their niche</font>

618
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,140
and what they provide which is why

619
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,620
they're able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a service offering</font>

620
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:35,110
but you know my confidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> is less than</font>

621
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:36,879
ma'am there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 50 in in Rev for they</font>

622
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,709
introduced appendix J which is basically

623
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:43,300
the privacy control<font color="#CCCCCC"> catalog and it's a</font>

624
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:44,800
host of controls but 53a is an updated

625
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">yet to include those privacy controls</font>

626
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,040
and I'm not really sure how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

627
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:51,430
would really even be on user accessible

628
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:53,560
but because 53a didn't have him we

629
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,810
excluded them because you know we were

630
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,490
using 53a is kind of our scope how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

631
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:59,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">were going to do it so the privacy</font>

632
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:04,300
catalog as you guys have seen isn't in

633
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:06,640
there 853 also it's a minimum<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

634
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,620
framework and there's certain things

635
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,110
when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to cloud that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font>

636
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:13,179
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> be interested in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it just</font>

637
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:15,550
doesn't cover it doesn't really cover

638
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:19,660
data export in the sense that if you

639
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:21,250
wanted to move from<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazon to azure can</font>

640
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,570
you get your data out is it like will

641
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:25,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">they give it to you is it come in an</font>

642
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:27,429

643
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,990
out this elaborate infrastructure and

VMS and stuff like that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

645
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:33,340
those there's no control<font color="#E5E5E5"> around that but</font>

646
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:36,520
you could find yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> in effectively</font>

647
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,929
an availability position or a concern

648
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,000
availability because you're unable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

649
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,980
get your data out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud service</font>

650
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,750
writer and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> we breach notification</font>

651
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,190
someone correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> me i'm wrong i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went</font>

652
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,380
through 53 last night just to make sure

653
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:50,830
but it's far as I know there is no

654
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:53,530
control that requires a cloud service

655
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:55,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">provider to make you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aware that your</font>

656
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:59,190
data has been breached usually this is

657
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:59,189
covered<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the contract language um</font>

658
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:05,070
it's an MOA between the agency and the

659
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:07,350
positive providers that provide that is

660
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:09,570
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our hierarchy yep but there's</font>

661
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:13,019
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing yeah there's no minimum</font>

662
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:14,970
security control yeah it's free it's

663
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:16,500
almost standard language in this cloud

664
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,940
service agreements at this point but

665
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,350
there's no control and we're talking

666
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:23,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">about just the minimum security control</font>

667
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:26,370
framework yes it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it your pii is</font>

668
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:29,279
breached but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think if you have</font>

669
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:32,239
PII in there it would even fall into

670
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,289
that yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if they were good</font>

671
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,120
corporate citizens they let you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font>

672
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:38,158
I food is also the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only requirement</font>

673
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,539
through contractual agreement whether

674
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,399
they're going to notify you<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

675
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:43,440
internal systems been breached without

676
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:45,360
your day<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being breach they don't have</font>

677
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,429
to notify you of that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

678
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,408
laws in place that<font color="#E5E5E5"> force that so we have</font>

679
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:51,210
to force<font color="#E5E5E5"> them away as a federal agency</font>

680
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:53,039
to require them to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

681
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,049
notification to us we have a timely

682
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,789
manner that their systems were preaching

683
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:58,889
internally so that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> potentially</font>

684
00:27:56,789 --> 00:28:01,110
look for any<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of thing bring our</font>

685
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:06,029
themes in and there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a picture</font>

686
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:07,620
that might go yeah yeah so I mean it

687
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:10,139
just furthers the point that you you

688
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:12,239
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> like less visibility than then you</font>

689
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:14,008
really it depends on what your risk

690
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,330
appetite is right i mean if you got not

691
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:16,889
a lot of important data in there and

692
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:20,759
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge risk appetite and you</font>

693
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:22,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">know go all in on cloud but so future</font>

694
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:24,389
work if you know if I was going to

695
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:26,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue to do this research or someone</font>

696
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:27,090
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick it up and keep going like</font>

697
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,490
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned before you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could use</font>

698
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:31,408
alternate procedures outside 53a like

699
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,730
you certainly wouldn't reduce the number

700
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:33,779
of controls that are in scope for

701
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,059
accessibility from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end-user</font>

702
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:38,460
perspective but you could increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

703
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:40,529
which would be awesome um you know

704
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically if someone performed the</font>

705
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:44,820
research again it would give rigor to

706
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:46,350
the research that we did um this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

707
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,500
thought was a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting one so</font>

708
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:50,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier that third-party</font>

709

710
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:55,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">assessing the cloud service provider and</font>

711
00:28:53,090 --> 00:29:02,820
asserting that those controls are in

712
00:28:55,049 --> 00:29:05,820
place well some auditors / Assessors are

713
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:08,820
better than others right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so some may do</font>

714
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:10,289
a poor job of assessing those

715
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,059
environments and give them a clean bill

716
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:17,000
of health so

717
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:18,860
in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assessing from the</font>

end-user perspective actually doing kind

719
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,549
of a look at who the auditors were that

720
00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:24,860
perform the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and assessing their</font>

721
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:27,950
competency and credibility that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font>

722
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,449
more at a company level but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it</font>

723
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,980
would it would give you more confidence

724
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:32,149
in whether or not the controls that

725
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,639
they're asserting or in place are

726
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:35,959
actually in place um you know that's

727
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:40,029
that's a little bit in a different

728
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,029
direction on the research perspective

729
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:06,500
yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be listed in</font>

730
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:09,168
FedRAMP you have to get annual you know

731
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:13,220
assessments perform to maintain that ATO

732
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:18,019
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> earn that the thing is um I was</font>

733
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:19,730
going to say this um I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I was</font>

734
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:21,649
gonna say<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually I'm sorry and it was</font>

735
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:33,740
it was trash-talking the<font color="#CCCCCC"> third party</font>

736
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:35,239
organization essentially yeah Thank You

737
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:38,809
Jonathan I remember I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was gonna say now</font>

738
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:42,110
so you can as a federal agency if you

739
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:44,600
have a dot gov email address effectively

740
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:46,129
you can request the package right so

741
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,259
like when<font color="#E5E5E5"> that third-party organization</font>

742
00:30:46,129 --> 00:30:50,209
does the audit they put together<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

743
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:51,980
package and submit it to FedRAMP FedRAMP

744
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:54,590
reviews the package<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then gives the</font>

745
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:56,000
ATO you can you can get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> package so</font>

746
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can have full visibility over those</font>

747
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:03,110
325 controls the way that they are

748
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,779
interpreted to be in scope um so that is

749
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:07,008
additional assurance as to the

750
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:08,779
effectiveness of the control but the

751
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:09,980
thing is the research here was supposed

752
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:11,779
to be black box that like you're

753
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:14,509
completely exposure completely hands-off

754
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:16,820
from being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that type of</font>

755
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:18,259
documentation but you know it if you're

756
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:21,189
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go in I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

757
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:21,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">certainly request it</font>

758
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:29,320
we've gone through your party<font color="#E5E5E5"> assessment</font>

759
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:29,320
is that work<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've done</font>

760
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:37,620
so it's kind of like pci in that sense

761
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:42,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">dennis it's basically in order to be</font>

762
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:44,350
eligible to perform that audit you have

763
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:45,760
to get cleared by FedRAMP so you have to

764
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:48,969
you have to submit paperwork you have to

765
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,950
prove technical competency and you know

766
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,630
industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> confidence seeing the ability</font>

767
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,490
to do it and then once you get like

768
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:56,559
FedRAMP certified and you can form that

769
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:59,470
work it's like now you can start bidding

770
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,139
on that work and it's almost implicit

771
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:04,120
that if whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do is is good</font>

772
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:09,160
enough you know or towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> fallot it's</font>

773
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:12,219
valid work yeah so this work even though

774
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's federal agencies was the target</font>

775
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:16,990
audience<font color="#CCCCCC"> for who could assess this this</font>

776
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,540
type of work can really help any anybody

777
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:21,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's going to be using um cloud</font>

778
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:23,409
services effectively because what we're

779
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:27,330
talking about is testing these controls

780
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:30,160
from anywhere as is a black box

781
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:31,809
environment so you know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font>

782
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">many people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are interested in doing that</font>

783
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:35,410
but you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were the security</font>

784
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,850
guy at a small business<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're going</font>

785
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take on cloud you could do some of</font>

786
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:41,049
these things to kind of give your your

787
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:45,309
company peace of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind of their security</font>

788
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:47,440
implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is Richards</font>

789
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:49,510
email address if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to contact him</font>

790
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,880
um that's my email address and I'm

791
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:53,610
active on Twitter<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like those things</font>

792
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,590
I covered at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning DSU</font>

793
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:58,299
information security craft<font color="#CCCCCC"> beer in my</font>

794
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:00,730
family although let's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about my</font>

795
00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:01,990
family right<font color="#E5E5E5"> um if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to talk</font>

796
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:04,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">about any of those things please reach</font>

797
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:06,490
out and I'd be happy to discuss<font color="#CCCCCC"> this or</font>

798
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,530
my work and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone is really</font>

799
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:11,770
interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this work I'd be happy to</font>

800
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:14,049
provide be essentially the workbook

801
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:16,030
underneath but you know the 3200 line

802
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:18,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">Excel workbook that's got all of our</font>

803
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:20,440
deep<font color="#E5E5E5"> dive analysis of like this controls</font>

804
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">and scope this one's on scope this is</font>

805
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,400
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's hard scope this is how this</font>

806
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,000
assessment procedure would actually be

807
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,799
implemented in a technical capability so

808
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,750
but I mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a you know 50</font>

809
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,679
megabyte excel file so it's not

810
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:37,360
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of throw around</font>

811
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:39,640
but so that's that's that so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

812
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a lot I'll open it up if anyone</font>

813
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,279
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions or very babies just</font>

814
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,940
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

815
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:47,349
blown back by this talk so any<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know we</font>

816
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,580
kind of had an ongoing dialogue while I

817
00:33:47,349 --> 00:34:01,178
was going so I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's any</font>

818
00:33:48,580 --> 00:34:05,199
questions but um not that I know of I

819
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:07,539
would be stunned if the one that I was

820
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,449
helping wasn't already doing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

821
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:12,909
they were asking me to do that too to

822
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:14,230
validate what they had found I'm just

823
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:18,039
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nature of that particular</font>

824
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:20,168
agency but yeah as far as I know it's

825
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:21,760
like shopping cart you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

826
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:24,069
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go to FedRAMP you / q no u</font>

827
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,899
you'd pick some some cloud service

828
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:30,308
providers and yet you go on<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean the</font>

829
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:32,649
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's so appealing to federal</font>

830
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:34,240
agencies is because I care about

831
00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:36,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">information security but like the guy</font>

832
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">who's program it is he just cares about</font>

833
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,520
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATO because it's like it's almost</font>

834
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:42,309
like a check box right now the mentality

835
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,619
in some instances<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't like oh security</font>

836
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:46,929
should be baked into what's going on and

837
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:49,510
I like I want to protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> my assets they</font>

838
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:50,829
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> security is like like all right I</font>

839
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,629
gotta deal with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

840
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:54,789
want my a toi just like come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

841
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:57,368
three years which that's changed now now

842
00:34:54,789 --> 00:35:01,119
we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the annual involvement in the</font>

843
00:34:57,369 --> 00:35:02,829
program<font color="#E5E5E5"> but right now the attitude</font>

844
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,980
towards information security and a lot

845
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:08,349
of instances is not like yeah let's do

846
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:11,049
extra auditing of our cloud service

847
00:35:08,349 --> 00:35:13,180
providers so unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we're</font>

848
00:35:11,049 --> 00:35:14,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">going that way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it gets better um you</font>

849
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,379
know if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been in the industry for</font>

850
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,379
a while

851
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">so they may think they had so</font>

852
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:34,029
they may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's different</font>

853
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:35,950
there's different deployments right so

854
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:38,320
there's there's pure cloud there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

855
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:42,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">bred there's private cloud amazon right</font>

856
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:44,500
now has gov cloud and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public cloud</font>

857
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,339
they're both<font color="#CCCCCC"> fisma compliant which is oh</font>

858
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:50,230
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I'm sorry Asher has a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gun well</font>

859
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:52,660
amazon has Gulf cloud in public but as

860
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">your also has gov cloud and public but</font>

861
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:56,109
both are<font color="#CCCCCC"> fisma compliant they just went</font>

862
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,459
ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> got them all if is compliant</font>

863
00:35:56,109 --> 00:36:01,170
really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only difference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between those</font>

864
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:04,150
two is that they don't staff

865
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:06,510
non-americans on the gov cloud side

866
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:09,070
that's literally the only difference

867
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:12,700
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tar is really the reason why they</font>

868
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:14,740
do that so but it's completely feasible

869
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,750
for an agency to have their own cloud

870
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,859
but then I mean then like what are you

871
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,750
doing because I mean it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

872
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:20,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">the traditional approach except it said</font>

873
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:31,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> center beam down the</font>

874
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:34,960
street it's it's at amazon yeah yeah

875
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:36,730
most organizations and in a legacy world

876
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,140
or being<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the harbor upgrades all that</font>

877
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,140
stuff they don't feel ya

878
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:53,290
so so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far as I classification on your</font>

879
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:55,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">pottery class background as your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font>

880
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:57,970

881
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:00,160
a secret on up there were only ones that

882
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:02,370
have actually gotten that far there's

883
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,710
couple small ones with no<font color="#E5E5E5"> major</font>

884
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:07,480
perspective AWS is not there to see you

00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:11,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little for currently which is just be</font>

892
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:29,980
if they've been yeah not to my knowledge

893
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:37,600
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> there it so it's been non class or</font>

00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:39,160
unclass at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point yes we're</font>

895
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,950
putting a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of DHA health information</font>

896
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,049
yeah

897
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:45,689
eh idea that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're actually</font>

898
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:49,710
moving with DHA<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very push very</font>

00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:52,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">heavily pushing so we've done this</font>

900
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:55,829
analysis sounds like<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes opinions about</font>

901
00:37:52,910 --> 00:38:05,549
missed eight hundred would you make some

902
00:37:55,829 --> 00:38:09,900
changes yeah um so I mean 53 gets

903
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:12,150
revised every couple years and I'm a I'm

904
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,079
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> s advocate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I don't know if</font>

905
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,640
you said it sounds like you have some

906
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:16,890
opinions I don't know if you meant<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

907
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,868
positive<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinions or negative opinions</font>

908
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:23,520
but I just for<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of fruit man to be</font>

909
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:25,440
more relevant yeah yes they're working

910
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,290
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> rev five right now it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out for</font>

911
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,420
comment yet but I mean the thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

912
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:32,730
controls need to keep up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology</font>

913
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,920
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the change in environments and cloud</font>

914
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:36,540
is clearly not only is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it here and being</font>

915
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:40,560
well adopted but the federal government

916
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:43,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">is mandating it as a first look before</font>

917
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,660
you're allowed to do anything else so I

918
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:50,099
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are some controls</font>

919
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:52,410
in 53 that already address cloud type

920
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:55,920
situations where like there's there's a

921
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:58,410
control about being physically like the

922
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,940
server that you're physically on how

923
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:01,440
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not associated with it like another</font>

924
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:04,319
one it's almost like process execution

925
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,420
isolation but on the hardware level but

926
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:07,980
it's not a required control so this

927
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,960
research is only looking at the moderate

928
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:13,470
baseline which is basically these 325

929
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,329
controls 853 probably has a thousand

930
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:17,189
controls if you count control

931
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:20,490
enhancements as controls in this

932
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:23,670
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I don't know if it's so</font>

933
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:25,709
much as adding controls as its or adding

934
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:28,260
additional controls to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tip of</font>

935
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:31,440
catalog as it is making<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain controls</font>

936
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,490
required in certain circumstances the

937
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,240
thing is they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it</font>

938
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:38,129
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> applicable to every situation and</font>

939
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,598
what and what they really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font>

940
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:42,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">they introduce this in ref or they're</font>

941
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:45,720
called overlays and basically an overlay

942
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:47,190
is your basic control set and then you

943
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,348
overlay which includes additional

944
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:51,450
controls so there's an overlay for like

945
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:53,310
space agency so if you're if you're NASA

946
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:54,370
or anyone doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the space stuff there's</font>

947
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:56,650
additional controls

948
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:58,750
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working in with pii there's a</font>

949
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:00,340
privacy overlay so what they really need

950
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,290
is a cloud overlay I don't know if I

951
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:04,210
don't have any updates if there's any

952
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:07,660
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that but a cloud overlay would</font>

953
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:09,520
certainly go a long way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> UM</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

954
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,560
making the security of it better<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

955
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if you'd be able to assess it from</font>

956
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,160
an end-user perspective but certainly

957
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:17,430
you couldn't you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> increase</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

958
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:23,170
level of assurance that your data is

959
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:30,549
secure so that's a long answer take ya

960
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:34,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">salli this just released a green they</font>

961
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:37,390
did 800 I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say it's like 177 it's</font>

962
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:42,490
up there do you know what it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's 177</font>

963
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:44,790
or 171 yeah and it's it's yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's guy</font>

964
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:47,740
to like cloud in implementation

965
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:51,490
environments yeah so yeah even nest is

966
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:54,939
um is aware that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming and it's</font>

967
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:56,080
kind of funny how this puts out special

968
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:58,300
pubs or guide and it's like sometimes

969
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,640
they'll zero in on like a particular

970
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:03,520
topic like this is how you secure

971
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,960
servers and then sometimes it's generic

972
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,520
like oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how you secure an</font>

973
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,260
environment you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know demand in like</font>

974
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,509
servers might be a chapter in there or a

975
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:12,130
section so I don't know it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

976
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:14,350
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the authors and this is more of</font>

977
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:17,650
an alliance of authors than it is a

978
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:19,779
department within missed you know I mean

979
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:23,590
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know beauty sign about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the class</font>

980
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:26,050
or video which is this bag essentially

981
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:27,670
if you're not familiar with big they

982
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:30,760
have that the cloud now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is still very</font>

983
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:32,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">much a living document currently yeah</font>

984
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,030
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that work though I mean if it's</font>

985
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,650
a stick but you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not your</font>

986
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:38,170
environment how do you stick it so it's

987
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:40,390
more focused on the connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

988
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:42,550
cloud so it's your connections always

989
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:46,450
they call it cabins on access point yep

990
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:50,080
and then the proper instantiation of

991
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:51,520
your systems is MacLeod<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yes so</font>

992
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,410
that's kind of what it focuses more on

993
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,670
but it also talks about how the cloud

994
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:56,410
service provider has to meet<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

995
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:57,520
controls<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay talk about how it goes</font>

996
00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:01,870
have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> ramped</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

997
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:04,900
stuff think yeah um that's interesting

998
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:06,850
the one thing that I should remark on is

999
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:09,430
like when you go to the cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

1000

1001
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:13,569

1003
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:16,750
