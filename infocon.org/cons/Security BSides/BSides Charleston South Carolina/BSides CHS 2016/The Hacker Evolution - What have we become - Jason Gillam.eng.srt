1
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:23,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so um I have this is a talk I</font>

2
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,340
put together because I I have kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

3
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:31,110
some interest in the word hacker and

4
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,400
where it comes from right and I mean

5
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,050
there's there's a long history of the

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,650
word<font color="#E5E5E5"> and these days when you look in the</font>

7
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:41,970
in the media if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the movies</font>

8
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:43,769
it tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have sort of a dark sort of</font>

9
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,410
connotation with it is if it's something

10
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:50,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's probably bad probably evil</font>

11
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:55,459
probably committing a crime of some type

12
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:57,809
so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is quick summary of me</font>

13
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,780
principal security consultant that

14
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:05,970
secure ideas I do some open source

15
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:08,610
software stuff brew beer and of course

16
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:14,970
I'm a hacker but not the evil kind I was

17
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:17,910
just talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

18
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,649
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> labels and what we tend to</font>

19
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:23,850
call ourselves and what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to</font>

20
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:26,580
think of us as and and how hopefully we

21
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,940
can maybe over time change that back to

22
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:33,110
something that it you know is a little

23
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:35,810
nicer a little little<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

24
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:39,240
representation of what we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we do</font>

25
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:42,539
so I know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> got some fantastic in the</font>

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,470
room and you know some over there so

27
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:45,470
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be over there</font>

28
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:55,770
um you guys do pen testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok that's</font>

29
00:01:51,430 --> 00:02:00,060
ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it against you that's it</font>

30
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:02,320
but when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

31
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,490
this reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was asking with that is</font>

32
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,038
when somebody asks you what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

33
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,420
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do for a living</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i get asked</font>

34
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:09,068
that question<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I always hesitate</font>

35
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,899
because I mean the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font>

36
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:12,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes to mind is well I'm a hacker but</font>

37
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:13,450
then I'm thinking we'll wait should I

38
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:14,380
say that is this person going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think</font>

39
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,988
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it the wrong way are they going to</font>

40
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,299
think immediately<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I'm a criminal</font>

41
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:23,590
because that's the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know the</font>

42
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:25,780
media presents it so I'm you know I

43
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,880
usually I'm same security tester I do

44
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:31,690
computer stuff computer security stuff

45
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,100
and they're happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that but you know</font>

46
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,910
among friends I'll say I'm hacker I'll

47
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,709
admit it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um when you hear the word</font>

48
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,850
hacker what do you think what are you

49
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:42,310
thinking are you thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy</font>

50
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:46,989
here this is what everybody thinks about

51
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:50,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">right Elliot um we have you know that</font>

52
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:53,049
the token mr. robot type of

53
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:54,910
representation of they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done a pretty</font>

54
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:58,410
good job I think of representing all the

55
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:01,810
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that are involved in in</font>

56
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,430
today's version<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess of hackers and</font>

57
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,930
tools and the types of things that

58
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,329
happen there but they do kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of put it</font>

59
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:13,450
on sort of a dark side like it's it's

60
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:15,190
something that there's criminal aspects

61
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,869
to it like we all know that a lot of the

62
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,780
stuff they're doing is it's against the

63
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:22,090
law but it's okay because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it</font>

64
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,850
against the evil Corp so you know who

65
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:29,739
cares now if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look at that came out in</font>

66
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:32,140
2015 real hackers in my opinion started

67
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:34,810
back in nineteen fifty<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight so it</font>

68
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:40,059
wasn't that<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy in the hood it was all</font>

69
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:43,120
these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the nerdy glasses okay so</font>

70
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:46,630
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> at MIT all right this was the</font>

71
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,030
the model the tech Model Railroad Club

72
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,380
is what they call themselves right so

73
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,069
you're thinking trains was that have to

74
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:55,420
do with hacking so so the club was

75
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:57,849
actually broken into two different

76
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,500
groups they had the people who built all

77
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:01,630
this stuff on top of the table so that's

78
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,310
you know you're the actual trains and

79
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,440
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trees and the models and all that</font>

80
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,140
kind of good stuff and then they had

81
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,880
people who basically worked on all the

82
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,510
elaborate switches instead underneath

83
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:18,219
the table and that's what these guys did

84
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:21,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so so they did they did a lot of</font>

85
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:24,940
that stuff and an MIT had I mean they

86
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:27,870
had a big like whole floor dedicated in

87
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:34,320
the I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they called it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the AI lab</font>

88
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:37,570
dedicated to an IBM monster of a machine

89
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,930
but then they also had I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was on</font>

90
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:47,770
the floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> above the what they called it</font>

91
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:49,419
tick so over DX 0 which is what they

92
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,169
start a place playing around with now

93
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:57,780
this computer was donated to the school

94
00:04:52,169 --> 00:05:00,490
it originally had<font color="#E5E5E5"> 64 K of memory and</font>

95
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,650
they because memory was so expensive

96
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,570
back then they actually got rid of 60 of

97
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,340
it like they kept 60 to move on to the

98
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,840
net whatever it was the tx1 or whatever

99
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,590
the next version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the computer was</font>

100
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,450
they were going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use they actually</font>

101
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:14,289
took a memory from this one which was

102
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:18,070
sort of a prototype and then left them

103
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:21,820
with 4k so they had 4k no operating

104
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:24,789
system and here go play with this thing

105
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:28,000
so these guys of the tech Model Railroad

106
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:30,219
Club basically sat down started messing

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,979
with it and they basically wrote

108
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,630
rudimentary operating system debugger

109
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:38,919
they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get sound to come out</font>

110
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:42,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it they did a lot with 4k of memory</font>

111
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:44,080
now I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that I had a I had a</font>

112
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,289
Commodore vic-20 I was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

113
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,000
computer i owned and it started off with

114
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:50,919
20k but the operating system took up

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,560
about four<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually is a little bit more</font>

116
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:56,710
sorry took up a little bit more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 16</font>

117
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,770
of that so I had 4k total to write

118
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,120
programs in these guys had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

119
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,349
write the program in the 4k but they

120
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,310
also had to basically write everything

121
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,500
else the operating system debugger

122
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,940
so on and so forth so they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

123
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,490
very restricted on their instruction

124
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,260
sets they didn't have much to work with

125
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,150
to me that's hacking that's that saying

126
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,920
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this piece of technology it only</font>

127
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,500
does so much let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it do more than</font>

128
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:23,660
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever designed to do that's that's</font>

129
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:26,540
the epitome of it so the hacker ethic

130
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:29,540
which I will sort of quote out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a book</font>

131
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,870
here Steven Levy he wrote a<font color="#E5E5E5"> book called</font>

132
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:35,630
hackers<font color="#CCCCCC"> here of the computer revolution</font>

133
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:37,160
and he kind of put this together here so

134
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to computers and anything that</font>

135
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,370
might teach you something about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

136
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,370
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world works should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be unlimited in</font>

137
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,930
total<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm always yield to the</font>

138
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,430
hands-on imperative I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that last</font>

139
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,830
part is<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably one of the more</font>

140
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,120
important ones for us is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you</font>

141
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,880
can read about something all you want

142
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,560
but actually try it do it get your hands

143
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,040
dirty and play<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it that's how you're</font>

144
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,080
actually going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really learn things I</font>

145
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,730
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> that applies outside of hacking as</font>

146
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,409
well but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what it's about</font>

147
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:09,080
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information about the information</font>

148
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:12,440
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> unlimited in total back in</font>

149
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,760
those days computers were seen as these

150
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,680
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> only experts were allowed to</font>

151
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,480
even come near they like if you weren't

152
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,980
trained properly you weren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

153
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,290
allowed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same room as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IBM</font>

154
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:25,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">beast that was on on that ground off the</font>

155
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:26,660
floor so these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean they had that</font>

156
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,640
the tick so they could play<font color="#E5E5E5"> with but</font>

157
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,770
prior to that they didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

158
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,380
they couldn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> access to the</font>

159
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:35,419
IBM it's very very restricted in there

160
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,710
that's sort of you know build your

161
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:42,470
program on a punch card and run it

162
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:48,560
through but so they kind of started this

163
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:50,780
hacker ethic and the part about

164
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,640
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be unlimited in total</font>

165
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,169
that doesn't mean credit card numbers

166
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,930
and social<font color="#CCCCCC"> security numbers just in case</font>

167
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:58,040
anyone's thinking that it's really

168
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:01,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">information that has to do with like how</font>

169
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:04,160
do things work so stop making computers

170
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:07,100
a big secret open sourcing things is a

171
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,450
really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know sharing our</font>

172
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:13,090
knowledge making the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world a better</font>

173
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:16,330
place that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it's all about ok so</font>

174
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:21,150
next they got a better computer

175
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:23,349
the PDP one so this was donated by DC

176
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,258
and they actually they made they made a

177
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:27,909
few of these but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> they just gave one</font>

178
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:29,379
brand new<font color="#E5E5E5"> justice is this time they</font>

179
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:33,309
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take all of the memory out of it</font>

180
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:34,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">no they gave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the tech monorail</font>

181
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:36,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they heard about the type of</font>

182
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,099
stuff they were doing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their did so</font>

183
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,700
the awesome thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the PDP one is</font>

184
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:43,719
this is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advent of</font>

185
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,730
computers aren't these big things that

186
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:49,269
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting in rooms that only experts</font>

187
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:52,560
can use this was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

188
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:54,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">know maybe they can be more personal</font>

189
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,430
computers can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that individuals</font>

190
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,390
can interact with so the concept of a

191
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,859
user interface it looks pretty

192
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:02,140
rudimentary here right this is called a

193
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,510
flexor writer<font color="#CCCCCC"> here on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right and then</font>

194
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:06,550
they have the screen which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not like</font>

195
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:09,130
any screen we're used to and of course

196
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first really cool thing they wrote</font>

197
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,250
with it they did a few different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

198
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,490
but their worst really cool thing they

199
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:18,100
did with it is they<font color="#E5E5E5"> built the game I</font>

200
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,899
think that's cool so if they wrote it's

201
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,959
a multiplayer game called space for and

202
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:26,250
you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have heard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it but this is</font>

203
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,719
this what they did so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they kind of see</font>

204
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,750
this online you can actually you can

205
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,920
find space for online there's I don't

206
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">off this flash would you have a script</font>

207
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:39,099
or whatever they've come up with

208
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:41,069
simulations of it here and you two

209
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,940
player game and they actually built

210
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:46,899
joystick like things actually got a

211
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:51,490
picture those next here these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font>

212
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:54,399
of those guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> later on and they have you</font>

213
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">know joystick type contraptions so so</font>

214
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,839
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool user interface</font>

215
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,940
interactive thing that was ever built on

216
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,320
a computer was a video game I think

217
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,930
that's awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> see games the games they</font>

218
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,740
still kind of push the envelope

219
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:08,410
especially when it comes to graphic

220
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,690
cards which we can now use to to crack

221
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:16,810
hashes conveniently as well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind</font>

222
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:19,750
of cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> um sir so this guy here he's</font>

223
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,869
Steve<font color="#CCCCCC"> rustles he was the mastermind</font>

224
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">behind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> space</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> war</font>

225
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:27,190
he was a mean guy who did it doesn't

226
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:29,860
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all like typical hacker does he</font>

227
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:33,389
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the hood on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he's and I'm</font>

228
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:40,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">know now he looks kind of like a geek</font>

229
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:44,500
very proud<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 I'm sure so so we move</font>

230
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:46,300
forward some so this was mi<font color="#CCCCCC"> T's more on</font>

231
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> East Coast computers started making</font>

232
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,529
their way for using them with in clubs

233
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,599
and playing with them and hackers in

234
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:55,540
general started making their way further

235
00:10:52,600 --> 00:11:00,670
further to towards the west coast and

236
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:03,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you had you know schools within the</font>

237
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:09,069
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bay Area which you know kind of led</font>

238
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:13,570
into Silicon Valley later on so that by

239
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:16,930
around nineteen seventy this hackers

240
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:19,089
became in several areas became kind of

241
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,099
enthralled with another game this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

242
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:24,070
was well<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a game</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is called the</font>

243
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,389
game of life you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have seen this</font>

244
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,920
thing before there's there's these

245
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:30,779
certain rules it's actually the game

246
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:34,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">mesh it was was it came up a</font>

247
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:37,120
mathematician John Conway came up with a

248
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,740
concept of the game itself and so

249
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,870
there's there's a certain rules around

250
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,550
you know how long a pixel survives

251
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,790
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not there's other ones in its</font>

252
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:48,670
proximity does it become crowded and die

253
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:51,040
or does it die from being alone you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

254
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's so there's or does it replicate</font>

255
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,810
and so this sort of thing happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

256
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,930
this the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why this is significant</font>

257
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:01,930
to those of us in the hacker world is

258
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:05,560
because one of the main symbols that we

259
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:07,719
use is called the glider actually comes

260
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,680
directly from this game and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font>

261
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:15,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">you a picture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a modern-day hacker</font>

262
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:20,819
some people may know this guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> move mixes</font>

263
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:23,350
his handle okay and he's he does the

264
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:25,019
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit minute this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

265
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,670
probably what he's most well known for

266
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:30,069
but the reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pointing this out</font>

267
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,699
is because look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what's on his hat all</font>

268
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:33,858
<font color="#E5E5E5">right that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

269
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:35,959
a set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pixels from the game of life</font>

270
00:12:33,859 --> 00:12:38,389
and specifically that's the set that

271
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:40,248
makes something called a glider and

272
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:48,679
here's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> a glider does when it</font>

273
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:52,910
follows the rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the game life hope</font>

274
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:55,189
there goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay see how that goes right</font>

275
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:57,759
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically it maintains himself but</font>

276
00:12:55,189 --> 00:13:01,189
just keeps gliding along this rain so

277
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:05,209
they thought this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was this was a really</font>

278
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:07,879
interesting thing the so the guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

279
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:11,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">came up with this Conway he offered at</font>

280
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:13,579
the times of 1970s nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bonus</font>

281
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:15,529
fifty<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars to anybody who could come</font>

282
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:17,238
<font color="#CCCCCC">up with something called a glider gun a</font>

283
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:19,309
glider gun would have been a pattern

284
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:21,649
inside of the game of<font color="#CCCCCC"> life that would</font>

285
00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:25,879
spawn gliders so would create multiple

286
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:27,799
gliders went after another and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a guy</font>

287
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:29,720
named hacker named<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bill gossipers the</font>

288
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:34,339
one who came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with with this pattern</font>

289
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,629
which does exactly that game<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alexa</font>

290
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:40,970
another thing you can find that in a lot

291
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:44,749
of places online as well just see after

292
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:46,100
the pattern<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of levels out just</font>

293
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:50,899
start seeing gliders come down through

294
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:53,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">the middle see there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one now right so</font>

295
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:56,720
he earned his fifty dollars so but hey

296
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,829
they would spend all night staring at

297
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,879
different powders and trying to figure

298
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:00,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do different things</font>

299
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,939
which these days<font color="#CCCCCC"> would like us like so</font>

300
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:06,889
what a bunch of pixels<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Korean</font>

301
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:08,389
minute but that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is it's so</font>

302
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:10,879
much time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort was put into this</font>

303
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:14,449
that we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> made a symbol out of it</font>

304
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:16,429
and i've seen at 2,600 conferences I've

305
00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:17,988
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who have tattoos of the</font>

306
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:19,699
glider there's the Hat with the glider

307
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:23,149
on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen people you put it on</font>

308
00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:26,269
various different things so when you see

309
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:28,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">that symbol around now you know where it</font>

310
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:28,449
came from

311
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:36,250
so one<font color="#E5E5E5"> other guy you you guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know who</font>

312
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:37,269
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy is right Steve Wozniak here's a</font>

313
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:44,199
pic I'd like this picture better

314
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:45,430
actually so another hacker he was a you

315
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:46,839
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely I guess sort of the</font>

316
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,949
epitome<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the hardware hacker when it</font>

317
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:49,470
comes to personal computers right

318
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:53,109
because he he came up with

319
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,759
single-handedly the apple one<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

320
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:57,370
build in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the garage and came up with</font>

321
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:59,199
concept and he just did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because it</font>

322
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">was fun it was part of a computer club</font>

323
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,339
and was something really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool to do it</font>

324
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,360
turned into a course a major corporation

325
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:15,370
but that was in 76 he came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

326
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:16,810
so pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome stuff so that's all</font>

327
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:19,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">the good stuff about hackers that's how</font>

328
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:22,018
like the way things used to be I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

329
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:23,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about when you know what changed</font>

330
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:27,009
because things are not like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that anymore</font>

331
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:29,649
so I would blame<font color="#CCCCCC"> the movies to start</font>

332
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:32,380
with they kind of have an impression on

333
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:33,819
the general population so hackers back

334
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:39,069
in those days they knew when hacking was

335
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:41,319
and it was movies such as war games that

336
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:42,610
was probably the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first one that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had any</font>

337
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:44,829
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really made an impression that</font>

338
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:48,250
had hacking in it or some form of

339
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:49,810
hacking now the hacking that happens in

340
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,010
war games if you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual</font>

341
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,819
applies anybody remember seeing this

342
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:56,050
movie yeah it what do they<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what's</font>

343
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:58,560
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of actual hacking stuff</font>

344
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:01,089
david.aileen he did your war dialing yes

345
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,160
there's the main thing war dialing and

346
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:05,440
the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is he guessed passwords</font>

347
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that's it that was the extent of AI</font>

348
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,709
mean I watched through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole movie</font>

349
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">you didn't do anything else that was</font>

350
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:12,339
hacking he guessed some passwords

351
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,380
because he didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> run any brute-forcing</font>

352
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:15,699
or anything like that he just think what

353
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,459
would be a good password you know

354
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:20,979
tighten it may be it may be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

355
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:23,589
of open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source intelligence you know did</font>

356
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,829
some research on I forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name of</font>

357
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:31,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">the professor that he was falken that's</font>

358
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:34,750
it yes yeah but but other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that</font>

359
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:37,029
that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much all I did so Matthew</font>

360
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,100
Broderick is a hacker and we know that

361
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:40,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">because he did it again and Ferris</font>

362
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,470
Bueller's Day Off

363
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:48,339
so he took his skills from war games and

364
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,420
use them one more<font color="#CCCCCC"> time he was uh in this</font>

365
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:50,470
part here this is where he turns<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

366
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">out of the camry says you know i asked</font>

367
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a car for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my birthday and instead i</font>

368
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,829
got a computer then he turns around and

369
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:59,410
he changes his absences or something

370
00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:01,180
like that on us on his school report he

371
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:04,559
broken supposedly broke into the school

372
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:07,780
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really show how he did it so</font>

373
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:10,500
that's another one now this one here

374
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:14,849
everybody know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one is sneakers</font>

375
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:17,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">figures so great thing about sneakers</font>

376
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:19,750
for me it made an impression this this

377
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:21,490
was the first time that I saw in the

378
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,079
movies there was this concept of an

379
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual real penetration test like the</font>

380
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:27,099
idea that somebody would pay you to hack

381
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,600
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> their system and tell you how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

382
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:33,309
right so sneakers is it for that I know

383
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,500
there's this whole other plot in there

384
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:37,418
too but to me this was like the first

385
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,100
movie that that really made this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

386
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:42,940
impression so I don't know that this is

387
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:46,330
necessarily a negative one but it was

388
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,610
definitely impressionable and then of

389
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">course we have probably the one of the</font>

390
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:53,889
most impressionable some of the worst

391
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,750
graphics ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the movie hackers</font>

392
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,190
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully everyone in the room</font>

393
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:01,539
scene hackers if you haven't you should

394
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:03,730
you should watch it in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion it</font>

395
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:06,908
actually has more relevance today than

396
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:10,750
it did in 1992 when it came out<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

397
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:12,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">you look through from different aspects</font>

398
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:15,760
of it okay maybe the clothing styles

399
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:18,490
have changed okay they didn't wear hoods

400
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,480
back then now we all wear hoodies right

401
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:25,210
now but they do all the all the same

402
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff right so the phone phreaking they</font>

403
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about I guess we don't really do</font>

404
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:30,820
phone phreaking so much but dumpster

405
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">diving they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about that just you</font>

406
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the various hacking into systems</font>

407
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,590
probably the passwords have gotten a

408
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:40,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit better since those shoulders</font>

409
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:42,070
yes yeah shoulders the exact is shoulder

410
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,390
surfing so all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we talked</font>

411
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,980
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when we're talking about doing</font>

412
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,770
pen tests and the different aspects of

413
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,820
it they touch on all that stuff inside

414
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:52,090
of hackers they do a pretty good job of

415
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:54,370
that um you know they also have the bad

416
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:56,740
guy side of the two this is a quote<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

417
00:18:54,370 --> 00:19:01,809
the movie so they have whose name agent

418
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:05,380
agent dick Gill<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy this guy here with</font>

419
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:07,210
glasses he says hackers penetrate and

420
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,039
ravage delicate public and<font color="#CCCCCC"> privately</font>

421
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">owned computer systems infecting them</font>

422
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,730
with viruses and stealing materials for

423
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:17,559
their own ends these people they are

424
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:19,299
terrorists and I don't know that the way

425
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:23,289
he he spoke in this movie because I

426
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:25,960
watched you recently and just to kind of

427
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:27,460
refresh my memory on it and do the

428
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,020
things that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was saying throughout the</font>

429
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,880
movie like this this is just one of many

430
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">quotes where he says you know hackers</font>

431
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:38,260
are bad they're evil they were criminals

432
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:40,780
so on and so forth is very much in line

433
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,908
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the media says these days</font>

434
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:48,010
about hackers right just that using that

435
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:50,770
term the word hackers so that's um

436
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:52,750
that's all i have for movie stuff at

437
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,460
least for now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to move on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

438
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,870
some other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't want to keep</font>

439
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">going with movies because they kind of</font>

440
00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:00,129
got worse as time went on in terms of

441
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,270
like what they do with hackers and now

442
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,460
you'll notice there's there's an a

443
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,658
single TV<font color="#E5E5E5"> show that involves criminal</font>

444
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">investigations that doesn't involve</font>

445
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:09,309
requiring a hacker to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get things done</font>

446
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:11,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're talking with that last night so</font>

447
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:13,389
yeah they're on every show now they try

448
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,559
to make the hacker person cool but

449
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:19,360
they're almost always have some kind of

450
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:22,389
dark criminal background<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

451
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a hacker lexicon so wired magazine's</font>

452
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:30,309
supposed to be our friends they've come

453
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:32,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">out and said gray hat hacker who came</font>

00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:34,059
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> to save the day for the feds I</font>

455
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:36,189
think they're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the the</font>

456
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:40,480
iphone when they were trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

457
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:43,270
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the iphone with the one of</font>

458
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,440
their criminal investigations the part

459
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,789
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was actually getting at here is</font>

460
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,649
at the bottom there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are three types of</font>

461
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:48,640
hackers white hats black hats and gray

462
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:51,909
hats

463
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:55,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay who has ever spoken to anyone who's</font>

464
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:58,540
introduced himself as a black hat I'm a

465
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:00,010
black hat hacker hacker anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I</font>

466
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:03,610
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it'll ever house is a unique</font>

467
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:09,370
I mean they might claim it under an

468
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:12,219
alias maybe so 80 it kind of makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

469
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:14,469
mad actually that we're all of a sudden

470
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,590
hackers are divided into three

471
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,570
categories right we're either good or

472
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:21,399
evil that's what white hat and black<font color="#CCCCCC"> hat</font>

473
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:27,000
supposed to be or<font color="#CCCCCC"> where somewhere in</font>

474
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:29,590
between right so what color hat are you

475
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,890
you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really tell by the visual you</font>

476
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:34,480
know what do you wear I have actually

477
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,190
have a black hat somewhere in my bag

478
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,960
here I could put that on but it doesn't

479
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">make me evil right just because I decide</font>

480
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,070
to wear<font color="#CCCCCC"> a piece of clothing so we might</font>

481
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:46,719
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> just break up the entire</font>

482
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:49,689
alignment and okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> go from lawful good</font>

483
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,550
too chaotic evil so where are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you now so</font>

484
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:58,210
I know we have a lawful good paladin in

485
00:21:51,550 --> 00:22:01,389
the room Eriksson back but yeah so it's

486
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:02,740
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere between that</font>

487
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:05,440
really doesn't make sense i mean why not

488
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep going and break out the entire</font>

489
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,550
dungeon dragons character sheet just

490
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,939
hand this out to everybody say yeah this

491
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:16,450
is who I am right categorize me so it

492
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:18,430
that really bothers me<font color="#E5E5E5"> because hacker is</font>

493
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,780
is kind of it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you think about</font>

494
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,460
things it doesn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're good</font>

495
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,430
or evil or Eve so I'm even somewhere

496
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:26,950
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> its its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be any of the</font>

497
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:28,570
above just like you can have I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

498
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,310
police officers right you can have

499
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,230
police officers that are good you can

500
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,370
have police officers that are bad

501
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,780
they're doing bad things and then

502
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:40,120
there's probably a bunch that are kind

503
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:44,620
of in between so so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at</font>

504
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:46,510
some fairly current news play a little

505
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:53,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of game and looks at look at what's</font>

506
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:57,019
wrong with this picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we've he's a</font>

507
00:22:53,850 --> 00:23:01,500
supposedly a great hat hacker

508
00:22:57,019 --> 00:23:03,210
but if you read on a member of an

509
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,769
anti-semitic network of computer hackers

510
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:08,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">that wages cyberattacks against</font>

511
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:09,840
universities so he actually like they

512
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,539
openly say well he commits crimes but

513
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,370
that's considered<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

514
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:17,759
thanks you know it's necessarily good

515
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:20,219
he's not preventing crimes so at<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

516
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:22,320
point does it become black I mean how

517
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:26,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">bad do you ready draw the line where do</font>

518
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:31,158
you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's it's okay versus no</font>

519
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:33,990
that's definitely wrong so that's a

520
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:39,960
March 2016 for those who didn't know he

521
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:41,340
he claimed credit for hid so it was

522
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,779
printers and universities that had

523
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:48,330
anti-semitic messages on<font color="#E5E5E5"> them breaking</font>

524
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:49,919
into stuff another thing that really

525
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,809
makes me mad is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this concept of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

526
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:56,340
security researcher I mean what is a

527
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:59,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">security researcher okay so we have</font>

528
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:01,918
people out there who basically they hide

529
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,019
behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> this label to make it okay to</font>

530
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,549
hack into things I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a security</font>

531
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:07,409
researcher did you ask permission to

532
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:09,870
hack into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you have a contract in</font>

533
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:11,519
place are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually are you doing</font>

534
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:14,129
this just to become famous or are you

535
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,809
telling somebody because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

536
00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:18,178
see a security flaw that you think is

537
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:21,600
somebody's informations in jeopardy of

538
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:23,129
being stolen like what is the reason

539
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,779
fine so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically use this</font>

540
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:30,330
label as a way to get get away with

541
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:32,070
stuff and make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm not a hacker</font>

542
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,720
no I'm not hacker I'm a security

543
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:37,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">researcher so security researcher</font>

544
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,879
supposedly is better than hacker now to

545
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:41,399
be clear I mean I do believe in the

546
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:44,209
concept of a security Reacher researcher

547
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:47,789
but to me that's somebody who actually

548
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:49,769
puts together a lab environment and does

549
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:51,210
uses the scientific method to prove

550
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:55,200
something I mean that that to me is

551
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:56,909
security research hacking into a website

552
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then saying well my intentions were</font>

553
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:03,029
good therefore I'm a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> researcher</font>

554
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it's okay is not okay so one example</font>

555
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:06,000
of this I know you know pictures a

556
00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:09,629
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit hard to see with the lights</font>

557
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,830
in here but basically you

558
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:18,330
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pop-up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now this was a guy</font>

559
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:20,370
named david levin who in this thing was

560
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:23,310
state of florida elections he found a

561
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:28,649
sequel injection flaw<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay on an</font>

562
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:30,600
election website and he had this

563
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:34,350
interview we've made<font color="#E5E5E5"> this interview and</font>

564
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,649
he shows in the interview how we hacked

565
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:39,600
into it some of the accounts<font color="#E5E5E5"> he got</font>

566
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:41,730
logged into it this is all on<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube</font>

567
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:46,740
this where i got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this video</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i just</font>

568
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:48,420
pulled it off youtube and that goes

569
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,370
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part of it anyway so</font>

570
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:53,790
he puts all this information out there

571
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:55,739
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> after he puts out his video he</font>

572
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:58,790
tells the organization by the way

573
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:01,080
there's a security flaw in your system

574
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:06,990
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sound like responsible</font>

575
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:08,909
disclosure anybody right so yes it's it

576
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:11,400
kind of is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our responsibility since we</font>

577
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:16,110
have the knowledge to if we notice

578
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:18,420
something that looks wrong to to tell

579
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:21,600
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it it's really hard to do</font>

580
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:23,340
people have actually been threatened

581
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,810
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying hey you have a security</font>

582
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:30,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">issue and then they come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back with</font>

583
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:35,580
threats sometimes even even a potential

584
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:37,740
arrest in there but but we still have

585
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,260
that responsibility to to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

586
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,090
try to do the right thing when we can so

587
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:44,070
some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he did wrong</font>

588
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:45,990
here first of all he disclosed things in

589
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,550
the incorrect order that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

590
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,080
main<font color="#CCCCCC"> things right the other thing is if</font>

591
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">you find a sequel injection flaw</font>

592
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,409
somewhere like let's say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a</font>

593
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:55,260
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> ticket and you get a sequel a</font>

594
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,400
sequel message back don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and see how</font>

595
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">much data you can get out of the system</font>

596
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then don't post that on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube I</font>

597
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:04,920
mean there's I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think he did</font>

598
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,400
anything right so it's bad don't do that

599
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,400
stuff

600
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:18,730
make a choice Oh what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we gonna find</font>

601
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:30,820
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so this is the moonshine</font>

602
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:34,300
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the it's a fruit juice yeah so anyway</font>

603
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:36,189
don't do that so in one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my one of my</font>

604
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:38,379
best examples of what not to do or what

605
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:43,440
we shouldn't do as hackers is what this

606
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:46,390
guy does so Gregory Evans

607
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,400
self-proclaimed hacker number one he and

608
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:50,110
I don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember the list and I</font>

609
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:54,220
don't care but he's basically claimed

610
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:57,909
credit for every major awesome thing a

611
00:27:54,220 --> 00:28:00,220
hacker could ever do to try to basically

612
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:01,720
gained fame and fortune out of it okay

613
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,330
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what it's about we're</font>

614
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,040
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make we're trying to make</font>

615
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:10,090
computers available to people we're

616
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:11,379
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better place and you</font>

617
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:13,149
know his approach is just all wrong

618
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,190
there's there's whole websites that

619
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:17,250
basically cover all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the claims that</font>

620
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:21,340
he's made and debunk everything so

621
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:25,060
basically he's full crap it's all I need

622
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:27,990
to know about Gregory ovens<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so in</font>

623
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:31,960
the media this is fairly recent stuff

624
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:33,490
and yeah here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go more than 130</font>

625
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,030
restaurants in the cici's pizza chain

626
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:39,880
were the recent target of hackers okay

627
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:41,500
and customers credit cards may have been

628
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">stolen so these were probably cyber</font>

629
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,090
criminals maybe they use computers to

630
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,730
break in but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean they were</font>

631
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:51,699
hackers we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

632
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:53,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">article exactly what they really did did</font>

633
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">they actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with some new</font>

634
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:58,680
technology way of breaking into<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff or</font>

635
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,680
do they just run some automated tool

636
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:05,889
there's another one researcher accused

637
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:07,929
of hacking voters lists so now we're

638
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:14,250
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about now researchers are even</font>

639
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:18,210
bad anybody ever read the hacker news

640
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:18,210
this was an article<font color="#E5E5E5"> from there</font>

641
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,279
the hacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> tis twenty six-year-old</font>

642
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:23,419
hacker has been sentenced<font color="#E5E5E5"> to three</font>

643
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:25,309
hundred thirty-four years in prison for

644
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:26,899
identity theft as well as mass bank

645
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:29,149
fraud and<font color="#CCCCCC"> targeted it sounds like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

646
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:32,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a fraudster and a thief doesn't</font>

647
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:34,399
sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a hacker right but the</font>

648
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:36,230
article<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really does this wrong</font>

649
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:41,719
it's saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay hacking is bad you get</font>

650
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:45,429
30 34 years for hacking it wasn't for

651
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,720
hacking it was for stealing stuff thief

652
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:49,250
hackers from across the world will also

653
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,639
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the prowl trying to exploit the</font>

654
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:55,490
international event was<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

655
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:58,580
Olympics yet the Olympics so this came

656
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,929
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> shortly before so again it's not</font>

657
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,490
there's not going to be any criminals

658
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:02,779
there or thieves or fraudsters and I

659
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,950
think just hackers that's all we need to

660
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:08,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">worry about because we're the bad guys</font>

661
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:13,070
so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a perception thing that's a</font>

662
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:15,799
problem right it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so hackers</font>

663
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:18,399
for charity great organization great

664
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:21,080
intentions they do a lot of good<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

665
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,428
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hacked charities if you ever wear</font>

666
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,990
one of those shirts around you start

667
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:27,019
getting weird looks from people because

668
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:28,940
they're like that's bad right so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

669
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:32,710
this is an example of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use of it</font>

670
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:34,730
but it still<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets perceived incorrectly</font>

671
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:37,610
that's that's kind of why I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to</font>

672
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:40,669
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out it would be really nice</font>

673
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:43,039
if when people saw this in general they

674
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:45,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">recognized that this means these are</font>

675
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:48,289
people who try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make charities work</font>

676
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:51,199
better they try to really help the

677
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:53,090
people who need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be helped you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

678
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,490
there's there's so many organizations

679
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:56,509
that claim<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be charities that</font>

680
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,629
basically a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the money gets sucked</font>

681
00:30:56,509 --> 00:31:02,720
in and delivered<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the top level CEOs</font>

682
00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:04,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">and whatnot inside of the organization</font>

683
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,440
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people actually need the help</font>

684
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:08,469
don't ever receive as much as they

685
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,470
should

686
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:19,090
so how do we fix this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if we</font>

687
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:22,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">can but we can start by using the right</font>

688
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:25,480
label in places<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if you're</font>

689
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:27,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about your job I'm a pen tester</font>

690
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:31,150
I'm a security test or I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

691
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:34,510
consultant that's what you do if I talk

692
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:36,580
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I like to do I like to hack</font>

693
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:39,400
things which means I like to fix them

694
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,990
right that's a that's an activity

695
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:44,410
hacking is an activity it's not really a

696
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:48,460
job security testing is more<font color="#CCCCCC"> the job or</font>

697
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:49,690
you could say I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know red team or</font>

698
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't I don't know what</font>

699
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:55,390
we be another way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put it but i don't</font>

700
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:58,840
i don't see hacker as actually a job as

701
00:31:55,390 --> 00:32:00,730
more of an action and then there's

702
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,740
researcher if you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lab</font>

703
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:04,660
and it's a controlled environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

704
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,040
a researcher there's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other</font>

705
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,620
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we could put out there too i</font>

706
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,790
mean we could put script kiddie out

707
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:12,219
there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think anybody want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

708
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:14,020
actually call themselves a script yet so

709
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,460
if all you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is you have pulling</font>

710
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,500
the latest tool off the internet and

711
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,120
running it against stuff and hoping keep

712
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,960
your fingers crossed and hope that you

713
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:27,129

714
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:29,830
script kiddie maybe this one here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

715
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:31,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">think might make a difference so despite</font>

716
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:33,389
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> articles that go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out there if</font>

717
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:36,070
someone says yeah hacker broke into this

718
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:38,040
you can maybe try to correct them say

719
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:40,990
you mean a thief broke into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a</font>

720
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:44,889
fraudster stole a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

721
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:47,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">just because they use technology to do</font>

722
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:52,960
it that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean they're a hacker</font>

723
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:54,520
right so maybe they scam somebody maybe

724
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,530
they're an intruder they break into a

725
00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:01,540
system they're an intruder breaking and

726
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:03,460
entering you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing we can</font>

727
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:06,670
do is we can just do the right thing and

728
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:08,080
do it correctly so when we find a

729
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:10,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we see something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an</font>

730
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,449
issue don't go overboard<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you see like</font>

731
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:15,100
the sequel injection example you find

732
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,630
SQL injection somewhere because you put

733
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,240
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single tick into a field and this</font>

734
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,860
error pops up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last thing you should</font>

735
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,150
be thinking at that point is well I

736
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,520
wonder how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> information I can get</font>

737
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,650
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

738
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,200
unless you actually have a contract in

739
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:29,300
place that says<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's okay you can let</font>

740
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,740
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that hey I got this error</font>

741
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:35,149
message I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this means that you have</font>

742
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:38,330
a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your database or a</font>

743
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:40,700
problem about you know rather than

744
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:42,980
rather than trying to you know prove

745
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,140
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem by taking data</font>

746
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:49,820
out of it that can be very problematic

747
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:52,430
for you and it is crossing a line and it

748
00:33:49,820 --> 00:34:00,379
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you in a lot of trouble thrown</font>

749
00:33:52,430 --> 00:34:04,250
in jail that sort of thing so and that's

750
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:05,600

little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of something maybe you learn</font>

753
