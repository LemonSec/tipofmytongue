links in here so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you about</font>

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">myself obviously</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got that little intro</font>

16

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,519
thing I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> about training is kind of</font>

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,770
transferring knowledge things I know

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,600
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be something you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know so the</font>

21
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,579
idea is one thing we're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> in is</font>

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,099
figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what's the not knowns right</font>

23
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,979
and so I like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I push it a lot</font>

24
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,640
to a lot of classes now<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously my</font>

25
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,750
focus here is on information security so

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,789
you know usually if i'm not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

29
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:18,690
vulnerability assessment or audit or

30
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,820
something like that for a lot of the

42
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,000
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> because for me certificates</font>

43
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:46,679
anymore and doing this so long it's more

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,509
to help anybody that takes the classes

45
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:49,950
so that they can kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of further their</font>

course gadget and technology if

51
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,950
enthusiatic are enthusiasts so this

52
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,530
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at today a lot of</font>

53
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things if you go</font>

54
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,200
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two o'clock search going to be</font>

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,848
there as well are the two o'clock

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,770
presentation so you'll see some kind of

57
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,899
lead over here I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how the</font>

58
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,150
internet would be so I planned

59
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,410
accordingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'll have a little area</font>

60
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,940
there if you're connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your laptop</font>

61
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,590
right now and you have a good connection

62
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,579
then these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are things you can look up or</font>

63
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,319
you can write them down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

64
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">check them out later but this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font>

65
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll be going over right through the</font>

66
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,220
session so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know raise your</font>

67
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,440
hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have not used the internet</font>

68
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,090
right hopefully oh my goodness hopefully

69
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,740
everybody has used it it's a great place

70
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,720
to go to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

71
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,390
so a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the internet for</font>

72
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,970
online marketplace I mean ebay amazon

73
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:45,839
you pick it there's lots of uses of that

74
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:47,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">i love it to be guilty of that it's a</font>

75
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,590
great place to connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> with others I</font>

76
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,930
have friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> and/or family that are</font>

77
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,850
dispersed and they're not all on top of

78
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,560
each other so the only way you can do

79
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,120
that nowadays<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the trini thing right</font>

80
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,710
be on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook or Twitter or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,240
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's good for that kind of</font>

82
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:03,300
stuff if you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of stuff as</font>

83
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,160
well as things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> reddit right who</font>

84
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,760
doesn't love reddit so the internet is

85
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,530
amazing the problem here and as you will

86
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,679
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably coming up in a second is</font>

87
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,510
that privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a large concern or</font>

88
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,350
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a large</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> concern for everybody</font>

89
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,940
so as we are dealing and interacting on

90
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,710
a daily basis with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet we're</font>

91
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,329
giving away a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information right</font>

92
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,880
we're using a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we're also giving</font>

93
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,380
away a lot and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so hopefully in this</font>

94
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,150
session<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll kind of focus on some</font>

95
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,460
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might want to take home with</font>

96
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,700
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> focus on here is more</font>

97
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:38,030
practical knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so current threat</font>

98
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,549
landscape everybody talks about threats

99
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:43,650
unfortunate side of events is the assume

100
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,480
breach concept today<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have to</font>

101
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,790
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of live with and so we're</font>

102
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,500
constantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for ways to hunt for</font>

103
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,679
threats we're constantly looking for

104
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,420
ways to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to prevent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> threats for from</font>

105
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,520
taking foothold into our<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment and</font>

106
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,809
of course the keynote kind of bounced

107
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">onto this a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit in the beginning</font>

108
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,880
today so the bad guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are winning a lot</font>

109
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,980
of the sad news there but we are trying

110
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">to look to change that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right trying to</font>

111
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,630
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> new ways creative solutions better</font>

112
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,220
design to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font>

113
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,100
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be the future</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for us</font>

114
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,840
so that's one thing at least somewhat to

115
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,909
kind of go over and then unfortunate

116
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,070
side as you go through this you kind of

117
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,650
see and say well as more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more people</font>

118
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,360
interact online you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

119
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,359
and then there's awesome things about it

120
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,890
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a privacy perspective you kind</font>

121
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,120
of see more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more of this type of</font>

122
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,400
threat where you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of leaving</font>

123
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,980
all kinds of doorways open for yourself

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,799
for possible attacks in the future and

125
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,290
so attacks from you know risk like

126
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">identity theft tax like blackmail</font>

127
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:47,400
extortion you know unsolicited selling a

128
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,419
marketplace<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your information it's all</font>

129
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,239
out there and so that's

130
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,220
the concern so what I hope to<font color="#E5E5E5"> present to</font>

131
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,980
you guys as we go through these slides

132
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,600
is a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start searching for some of</font>

133
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,310
this stuff online and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of opening</font>

134
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,680
your eyes to some of the things and the

135
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,920
threats that are out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we'll</font>

136
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,300
start here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so when you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a</font>

137
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,920
search and what I found out through

138
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,920
going through and trying to develop this

139
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,690
talk is I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of take it from</font>

140
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,270
a perspective of how can I apply this

141
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,340
practically to a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different folks</font>

142
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,440
and so some folks might be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

143
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,760
different levels of interaction that

144
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,980
they want to go through and reduce their

145
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,380
overall privacy footprint and so it's

146
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,810
got everything it's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mom and dads</font>

147
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,909
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the family members down to the more</font>

148
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,050
technical crowd and what you can use to

149
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,240
kind of remove yourself from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

150
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,940
internet so the first thing to make note

151
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,860
of is the concept there of ego searching

152
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,410
right or vanity searching is what a lot

153
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,150
of people call it so ideally what vanity

154
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,100
searching our ego searching is is you

155
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,539
searching on some of your favorite

156
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,060
providers again i listed a whole bunch

157
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,620
of them down here<font color="#E5E5E5"> for yourself right and</font>

158
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,590
try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what kind of information</font>

159
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,420
is out there about you and so some

160
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,729
examples of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that of course they mention</font>

161
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,560
it here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide you've got putting</font>

162
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,090
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> name right obvious to what that</font>

163
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,190
would do and maybe it pulls back some

164
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,840
results but maybe it's too broad in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

165
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,180
scope of the results that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get so</font>

166
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,380
then you start to incorporate well phone

167
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,720
numbers you start to incorporate

168
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,480
physical addresses and some of those

169
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,030
types of things so one of the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

170
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,160
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in pen testing from a</font>

171
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,500
reconnaissance perspective we want to be

172
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,880
able to do like google hacking right but

173
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,190
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it and apply it in this</font>

174
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,650
regard to ourselves right to see how

175
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:27,660
much information is out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

176
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,060
an attacker could probably use to maybe

177
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,470
potentially get a foothold into that

178
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,960
information or that company or whatever

179
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,880
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so that's a key thing to make now</font>

180
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,440
a note that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

181
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,120
mentioned as you guys go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through and</font>

182
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,160
perform some of these activities<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

183
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,080
sure you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> signed on to whatever</font>

184
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,360
the provider is and so a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times</font>

185
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,979
you'll go to you know sign<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to your</font>

186
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,330
gmail and then you open<font color="#CCCCCC"> up YouTube and</font>

187
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,220
you're like wow it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> got me signed</font>

188
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,330
in or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to Google and start</font>

189
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,370
searching Google it's still got you

190
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,680
signed in so all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff is being</font>

191
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,030
tracked constantly so if you're you know

192
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">and again I might be talking to the</font>

193
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,489
crowd<font color="#CCCCCC"> here you might already know this</font>

194
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,080
but if you're ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

195
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,449
open-source intelligence-gathering you

196
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,949
want to make

197
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:05,139
as isolated as an environment as

198
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,990
possible so that that interaction point

199
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:10,210
is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> related or touching you right you</font>

200
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,039
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have good offset right and so as</font>

201
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,318
a way to do that make sure you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

202
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:16,628
signed on to whatever the provider is if

203
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,969
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can i'll show you</font>

204
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:20,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">in one of the slides you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can go if it's</font>

205
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:21,669
google or something like that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeps</font>

206
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:23,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">track of all your search history i'll</font>

207
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:25,029
show you a link you can go to and

208
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually clear out your search or start</font>

209
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:30,189
kind of restricting some of the access

210
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:32,409
to that also<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody hands up notice the</font>

211
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:34,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">Edward Snowden live stream this week</font>

212
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:36,639
from start page<font color="#CCCCCC"> com maybe not it was</font>

213
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:38,259
talking about election results and was

214
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,509
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about general privacy concerns</font>

215
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:43,060
with Trump becoming our new president

216
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:45,430
and so I really don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a dog of the</font>

217
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,529
fight but will tell you that hosting it

218
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,060
on start page calm is a good start if

219
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:51,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't know about start page calm</font>

220
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,779
what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it anonymize this all</font>

221
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,909
your searches through google so if

222
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:56,110
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do searches well use</font>

223
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:57,610
something that's going to anonymize

224
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,860
those searches now<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course here's</font>

225
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">another example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up go so as opposed to</font>

226
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">going in and using some of these search</font>

227
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:05,469
providers that keep tracking everything

228
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:07,990
about you maybe start to anonymize that

229
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:10,659
and use alternative sources of searching

230
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:12,939
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are out there also another quick</font>

231
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:15,339
thing just to kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of mention here if</font>

232
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:17,649
you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find yourself in a position</font>

233
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:20,050
like this has been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of hacks a lot</font>

234
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:22,479
of a breaches this year one big one

235
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,069
course of myspace concept but you're

236
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,409
like loud i don't think i have a myspace

237
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:28,180
account anymore and sure enough maybe

238
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:29,860
you did back in the day<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you didn't</font>

239
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,149
decide to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go close that account out so</font>

240
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's another thing to consider if</font>

241
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:34,029
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are things out there that you</font>

242
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:36,130
should do you should do some personal

243
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:37,539
grooming so being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

244
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,099
machine and do personal grooming is the

245
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,539
same thing as doing to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and</font>

246
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:42,579
doing some personal grooming and so

247
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:44,560
there's a couple sites i put in my notes

248
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:47,469
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name check</font>

249
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,300
calm as well as gnome calm you can go to

250
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,920
both of those sites put in like a

251
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">username or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that and see</font>

252
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">if it's visible on any social networks</font>

253
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,810
that are out there so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> just in case</font>

254
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,889
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a myspace account or you got a</font>

255
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,899
flickr account or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that</font>

256
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:00,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">you might go to those sites and start</font>

257
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:03,190
you know getting more visibility into

258
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:05,620
your foot your foot print<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay alright</font>

259
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">so moving forward</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> josh will talk about</font>

260
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,829
this is probably a little bit in his

261
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:10,810
presentation as well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept of</font>

262
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:12,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">daxing and so boxing is really an</font>

263
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,709
important concept because a lot of

264
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,530
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that go after and try</font>

265
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:20,470
to use intellectual gathering or the

266
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:22,150
first part of the pen test we use that

267
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,980
concept of kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of disclosing and</font>

268
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,870
finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> out about personal information</font>

269
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,400
about employees for the organization so

270
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,350
here they give you kind of just some

271
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,270
definitions to consider boxing the

272
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,160
process of retrieving hacking publishing

273
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,930
other people's information such as names

274
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,120
email addresses phone numbers and so on

275
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:40,060
and so a classic<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of this is</font>

276
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ashley Madison right so with the Ashley</font>

277
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:45,550
Madison cake 5 500 half-a-million-dollar

00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:47,380
lawsuits against this organization tool

279
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,630
to how they handle the the overall

280
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,640
breach and so that's a big cause for

281
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,310
concern course gamer gamergate<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

282
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,380
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> daxing as well so</font>

283
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,000
from a pen test perspective in a privacy

284
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,800
perspective really what I'm trying to

285
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">get across here is the more information</font>

286
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,579
that's out there that's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the</font>

287
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,070
more exposed you are right so that's

288
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:09,160
ideally what we want to kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of start</font>

289
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:10,930
looking at so as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we get into</font>

290
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,030
actually doing some of the search and

291
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,160
start start looking at how do we fix all

292
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,140
this mess it adds to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fishing</font>

293
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,000
connotation so this morning we have in

294
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,050
the keynote the concept of fishing and

295
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,390
what fishing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's so many</font>

296
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,310
different types fishing and smishing and

297
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:26,260
spitting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these different types</font>

298
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,630
of aversions of fishing that are out

299
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,630
there but when it boils down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it it is</font>

300
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:33,070
that a level of trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> exposure that</font>

301
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,470
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to compromise with that</font>

302
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:37,570
individual and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> family</font>

303
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,730
members or friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> or relatives or even</font>

304
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,110
colleagues you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody's going to</font>

305
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,370
get a fish and so we'll look at how to

306
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,050
address some of that stuff a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

307
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,550
later but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you know sites like hopes</font>

308
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,829
later right that you can kind of point

309
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,599
them to to give them my idea you know is

310
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,430
that a spam or is it a scam or something

311
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that that's a good useful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing or</font>

312
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,329
you can use fish tank so if you've been

313
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,490
given like a URL and you're worried

314
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,110
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this or you know you go to a site</font>

315
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,240
and you're wondering if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something</font>

316
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is considered a fish site those are</font>

317
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">good things to kind of address and kind</font>

318
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,890
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about and of course you know</font>

319
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for where all the attacks come</font>

320
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,400
from course we saw in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the presentation</font>

321
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,520
this morning a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of tax are going to</font>

322
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know our fishing campaigns are</font>

323
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,220
targeting the individuals here in the

324
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:19,210
United States so that's what that last

325
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:24,210
link kind of goes to so all right so

326
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,210
when looking at all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

327
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're going to find is there's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

328
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,019
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sites out</font>

329
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:32,670
they're that kind of expose some of the

330
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:34,980
information that's out there about you

331
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:37,498
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you post things so some</font>

332
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,930
examples of this might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be echo sec right</font>

333
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:41,819
so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had a little demo to show you</font>

334
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys if you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever seen echo sec</font>

335
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:45,149
before it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> neat they have a free</font>

336
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,999
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a pay version the free</font>

337
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:49,619
version is very throttle very limited

338
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:52,980
however what you can do is you can type

339
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:54,920
in a geolocation address ok and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then of</font>

340
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,149
that place you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can kind of draw a</font>

341
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,559
rectangle around the area of coverage

342
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,759
and then you can kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of see all the</font>

343
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,949
social interactions that are happening

344
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,839
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> that area now there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of</font>

345
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:05,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">different services</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are online that</font>

346
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,790
are like this so mappa<font color="#CCCCCC"> Phi's another</font>

347
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,319
example that's out there so what all

348
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,599
these sites do well they kind of track

349
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:14,819
you right so is another kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a silly</font>

350
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,889
example of that check-in services that

351
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:19,378
we use that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep track of</font>

352
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:21,300
us tweeting or whatever we're doing our

353
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:22,559
social interaction it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

354
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,748
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> track of that and then that could</font>

355
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,059
be something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might broaden your</font>

356
00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:30,569
access and so an example with that from

357
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:32,129
a privacy perspective would be if let's

358
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:34,259
say your privacy prone but you have

359
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:36,449
somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you that is not as</font>

360
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:37,620
privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem okay so they check into</font>

361
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:38,939
somewhere or they say they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

362
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,610
vacation or whatever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case may be</font>

363
00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:42,240
well now because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're understanding</font>

364
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,009
that you're friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that person</font>

365
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,809
they tagged you in something or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

366
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:47,399
the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be then you can kind of use</font>

367
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:49,170
these sites to geo locate that

368
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,179
particular person<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so some of that's</font>

369
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,620
kind of scary wiggle net you guys

370
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:54,569
haven't ever used that site it's a great

371
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,279
place to kind of geo locate Wi-Fi

372
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:57,689
devices so what you're going to get if

373
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,800
you zoom in you're going to get the SSID

374
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:59,998
you're going to get the mac address of

375
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,740
those devices that are all around<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

376
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:03,689
now obviously what we're trying to do

377
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,769
their right as we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> closer there we're</font>

378
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:06,120
try and do some more driving or

379
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:08,160
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we go up to</font>

380
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,589
the facility we create a fake access

381
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,029
point that says that name and we just

382
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:14,399
wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the results of that and then we</font>

383
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:16,799
pass the traffic on and so maybe that's

384
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,870
a bad guys thinking of what he could use

385
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">the site like this for as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as others</font>

386
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,999
so ideally start looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font>

387
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:26,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">these to be an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eye opener</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of what kind</font>

388
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:27,839
of information is around me so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

389
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,410
better kind of prune some of that

390
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,790
information away okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so I</font>

391
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,170
know I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what the internet</font>

392
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,279
access would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like here so what I</font>

393
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,229
wanted to do is I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

394
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,179
break<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the slides and show you what</font>

395
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,900
i would have kind of demonstrated in

396
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:43,880
this particular position

397
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:47,569
so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if I can get this so you</font>

398
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,820
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see it will all right so a</font>

399
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,990
couple things just really quick

400
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,540
photobucket right so photobook is a

401
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:55,490
service that you can use to send some of

402
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,290
your photos off and they can print<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

403
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,570
or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> case may be now this is</font>

404
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">just one example but probably a similar</font>

405
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:03,200
example would be any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other service that</font>

406
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,210
does the same thing right there's an app

407
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,890
for it on your phone probably when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

408
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:09,500
install the application it might ask you

409
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:12,380
can I use your camera can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I access your</font>

410
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,270
online or your your gallery of photos or

411
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,680
whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is or maybe you get to the</font>

412
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,870
situation where just upload the stuff

413
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't have a chance this</font>

414
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,380
morning to go off and pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> out some</font>

415
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,030
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what I've seen with this</font>

416
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">service before in the past is I've seen</font>

417
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:27,079
people's w-2s I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> people taking</font>

418
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,970
credit card pictures front and back

419
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,380
seeing driver's license all kind of

420
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,850
things that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would expect it probably</font>

421
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,260
shouldn't be on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet and how</font>

422
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,880
does this really happen well it could

423
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,670
happen out of neglect right or out of

424
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,930
just obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> just I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care or it</font>

425
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,910
could be that you install an application

426
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,229
that asks you access and it says what to

427
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,670
make things more convenient will start

428
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,620
uploading your files to your account

429
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:47,390
right so it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that</font>

430
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,100
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be a concern of ours now we</font>

431
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,569
might not choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use that service</font>

432
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,610
anymore because<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it handles its</font>

433
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,590
business as well as Google<font color="#CCCCCC"> dorking so I</font>

434
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,030
picked out some Google dorks to just

435
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,230
show off here the first one there

436
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,600
basically is just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look for</font>

437
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,820
pictures to be and the actual site one

438
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,970
of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually looks at iCloud photos</font>

439
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:07,130
online the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> one looks at DM dcma so</font>

440
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,870
that's a usual type of format that we

441
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,240
use for most digital photos today so

442
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,800
some of the Google<font color="#E5E5E5"> dorking if you</font>

443
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,210
haven't used Google<font color="#E5E5E5"> dorking before in</font>

444
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,260
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack methodology you should</font>

445
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,450
definitely look at it there's some

446
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,510
really good indicators<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromised in</font>

447
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:22,220
fact I probably threw some down here let

448
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:24,890
me show you in this one I'll skip it but

449
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,750
so like for me if I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing some recon</font>

450
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,060
on a particular subject organization

451
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,980
some of the things i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would use is google</font>

452
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,410
dorking for that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's site LinkedIn</font>

453
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,270
then specify the user or you can go to

454
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,810
some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> other sites like zoom info</font>

455
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:40,130
or lead411 or radius calm and put some

456
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,630
other information in there now what am I

457
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,700
looking for well I'm looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

458
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,780
format of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the email address I'm looking</font>

459
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,490
for the department that they're a part

460
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,350
of I'm looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for additional</font>

461
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,970
information like in this case if they're

462
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing email are they going to use their</font>

463
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,180
middle initial or not you know are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

464
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,730
going to do first initial last name

465
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,649
where they can

466
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,209
do and their formatting the email so i

467
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:59,250
can further when i get to the social

468
00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:00,750
engineering piece of the attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font>

469
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,670
have that information ready for me and

470
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,380
so good information and google hacking

471
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">in general looking for defaults and such</font>

472
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,370
as well as these other services that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

473
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:11,399
mentioned to you guys like echo sack and

474
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,870
map fi all of these services everything

475
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,639
that's a public event through a<font color="#CCCCCC"> meet-up</font>

476
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,740
or Twitter or some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those types of</font>

477
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,329
things even using things like tweet path

478
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,800
right you can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out if somebody is</font>

479
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:21,239
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> geo-locating some of their</font>

480
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,279
tweets and stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might be</font>

481
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know especially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

482
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,730
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that person a lot or they</font>

484
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:30,000
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of always are giving out their</font>

485
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,730
information so that's a lot of the

486
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,920
geolocation side of things let me jump

487
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:39,209
back in here<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so people</font>

488
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,670
searching is another thing when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i went</font>

489
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:43,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">through this process i wanted to be able</font>

490
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,969
to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the various different sites</font>

491
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,889
that have information about me online

492
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,230
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> by gosh when i started going over</font>

493
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:52,079
this list it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a tremendous list okay</font>

494
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:54,269
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know services like spokeo or pipl</font>

495
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,859
you can find a lot of information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

496
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:57,000
yourself on these sites now of course

497
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,680
the nice thing is they're kind of

498
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,600
centralized so they will point you in

499
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,739
the direction to who the source is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

500
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,500
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> that information is coming from</font>

501
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so and then of course a little bit</font>

502
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,780
later we'll talk about how do you get

503
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,459
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that right so you're going to</font>

504
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">start seeing like things like that's</font>

505
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,730
creepy stuff like pictures or your house

506
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:13,619
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start seeing how much</font>

507
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,760
your house<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs or what you pay for it</font>

508
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:17,369
maybe you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start seeing</font>

509
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,929
things like phone numbers email

510
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,299
addresses everything that is in the

511
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:24,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">Recon package right so all of that stuff</font>

512
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:26,069
is visible right and to the down degree

513
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:27,990
of some of this will see that even

514
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:30,000
things like Amazon wish lists are off

515
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,559
the actual limits here in that regard so

516
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,850
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of information out there on</font>

517
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:35,850
the internet about your birthday stuff

518
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:38,699
like that other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I think</font>

519
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:40,500
that's about it a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things there so</font>

520
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,700
searching<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some more right so when I</font>

521
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,010
started going through<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I was like</font>

522
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">well maybe I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to find a</font>

523
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:47,010
particular person's phone number<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

524
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">to validate that phone number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

525
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,520
individuals so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of services</font>

526
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:53,370
out there as well that do stuff like

527
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,230
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so ideally we just come in have</font>

528
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,428
somebody's name and you would try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

529
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,809
discover the phone number some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

530
00:17:56,429 --> 00:17:59,549
services<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually lets you discover</font>

531
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:01,290
things like cellular phone numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> or if</font>

532
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:02,370
it's coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a cellular carrier some</font>

533
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,860
of those types of things give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

534
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,889
previously known phone numbers of

535
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">individuals so</font>

536
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,460
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> great at tracking down people as</font>

537
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">well as addresses so now you can kind of</font>

538
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,880
further creep a little bit more into how

539
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,169
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> information out there from my</font>

540
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,140
physical address is out there now what

541
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:19,550
you'll find is you'll find a lot of your

542
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">physical address your phone number all</font>

543
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:23,300
that stuff just<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there on the</font>

544
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,980
internet so again a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of cool stuff to</font>

545
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,200
discover there through that process and

546
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,690
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of this you start saying this is</font>

547
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,170
a lot i want to start removing some of

548
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,370
this content so how do i do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

549
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,410
the first one's kind of obvious right

550
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:38,840
stop giving out<font color="#CCCCCC"> your information right</font>

551
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,700
when the earth account they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

552
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,010
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> email address right they don't need</font>

553
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,930
my phone number and so consider that the

554
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,750
first step right stop giving out your

555
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:49,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">information second stop is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the one</font>

556
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,630
that's probably maybe the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardest for</font>

557
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,370
some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess maybe unless you</font>

558
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,560
know how to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is the every</font>

559
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,300
place you go you want to save<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 cent on</font>

560
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,310
diapers or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you've got to</font>

561
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a loyalty card for that right so</font>

562
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:03,409
ideally what you do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is you</font>

563
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:05,360
handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> it by doing either giving out</font>

564
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,970
false information right we'll talk about

565
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,919
that a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit or just not filming</font>

566
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:12,200
everything out<font color="#E5E5E5"> right as far as that</font>

567
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,790
profile is concerned so don't providing

568
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">acta do not provide accurate information</font>

569
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,149
it's an excellent way to do it you could

570
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,889
also do disinformation so if in this

571
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,930
case you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give out some</font>

572
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,760
information may be a give it in the case

573
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:24,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's not linked to you or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> linked to</font>

574
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">a specifically straight your your</font>

575
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:28,040
information if you have to remember

576
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,750
things consider things like reversing

577
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,700
the day in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> month in the year some of</font>

578
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,160
those give a fake physical address also

579
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can use post office boxes right so a</font>

580
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,960
lot of what we do is we try to separate

581
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:40,580
ourselves from direct contact whenever

582
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,320
we're trying to increase our privacy

583
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,820
that's a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that and another</font>

584
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">example for that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could use</font>

585
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,169
anonymous email address seen by heard of

586
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,150
shark lasers<font color="#E5E5E5"> com so what shark lasers</font>

587
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:52,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">com will do is it lets you create</font>

588
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,630
basically an anonymous email and you can

589
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">sit it there right there in the web</font>

590
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,960
browser so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to download</font>

591
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,640
something or something requires your

592
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,800
email address give them an anonymous

593
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,390
email and then if it requires you to

594
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,040
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> confirm it it'll come right</font>

595
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:06,230
there into the window where you can

596
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,450
confirm it so but it's not linked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

597
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:12,080
so it's kind of separated from the

598
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:13,400
actual direct contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you can also</font>

599
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,439
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the email forwarding</font>

600
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,880
services listed here ideally they're

601
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,140
just trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clean you up so they're</font>

602
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,850
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect but if you're</font>

603
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,110
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reduce things like spam or you</font>

604
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,510
try

605
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:23,889
to get that mailbox back to a workable

606
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,990
state then you could use some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

607
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,670
services there<font color="#CCCCCC"> Plus as well some of</font>

608
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,620
these email forwarding services can

609
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:31,510
basically set it to where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

610
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,520
proxying the request through this

611
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,140
particular service so what that means is

612
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,970
kinda like Craigslist right so on

613
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,799
craigslist it's got an email and

614
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,870
somebody can click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that email to ask</font>

615
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,340
you a question well it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real</font>

616
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,870
email so it goes through a service

617
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,330
converts it and then jumps back to your

618
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:48,580
account<font color="#CCCCCC"> and and that way that providing</font>

619
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:50,379
that new unique layer of abstraction is

620
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,918
very useful from a privacy perspective

621
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:55,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as also things like</font>

622
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,880
implementing some measure of anonymous

623
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,400
calling right so maybe you don't give

624
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,620
out your real phone number maybe you use

625
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,230
an isolation method of that maybe you

626
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,719
give a friend's phone number or you use

627
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:09,130
some type of Wi-Fi calling service use

628
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,590
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of separates</font>

629
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,900
yourself from that physical number right

630
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,850
that's huge as well and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

631
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,580
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that my colleague will probably</font>

632
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:20,439
talk about at two o'clock is building

633
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,030
out an anonymous profile right if you're

634
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,549
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that content this</font>

635
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:26,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">information you've got to have some</font>

636
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:28,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">information to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give right so a good site</font>

637
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,760
to follow their be fake name generator

638
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:34,720
calm and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of create yourself</font>

639
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:37,480
a unique identity as far as rewards card

640
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,910
go again the downside here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

641
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you give it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information wise links</font>

642
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:43,450
back to you and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really good</font>

643
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,790
if you can give an anonymous email

644
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,559
address right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not linked to you so</font>

645
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:49,510
use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have an email</font>

646
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:51,010
address give them a fake one right if

647
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,720
they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a phone or maybe give</font>

648
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,160
them your anonymous phone number or give

649
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">them your google</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> voice or something like</font>

650
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,540
that don't link it to you now one of the

651
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:00,190
cool things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of places are now</font>

652
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,750
doing of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you see it in CVS you</font>

653
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,910
see at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best buy you see it at Toys R</font>

654
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,020
Us you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> go in store and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

655
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,760
it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a coupon if that's the</font>

656
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,500
argument that I don't get my ten dollars

657
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,210
off my hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> auto purchase you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can go</font>

658
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,679
in store and actually scan the card

659
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,530
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is again not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> linked to you and</font>

660
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,360
then get all of those you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know coupon</font>

661
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,490
codes or whatever it is so do keep that

662
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,320
in mind there's a lot of opportunity

663
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:23,650
here to do that concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

664
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,120
disinformation ok so<font color="#E5E5E5"> again how do we</font>

665
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:28,390
protect ourselves right keeping that

666
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,830
motive moving forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the biggest</font>

667
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,230
and I could have probably put this into

668
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,158
several slides is you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a good</font>

669
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,409
baseline

670
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:37,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I took it on myself to try to</font>

671
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:39,039
give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> examples of kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

672
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:40,359
looks like a good baseline and and if

673
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,830
there's nothing else there's something

674
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,359
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can take away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from this so the</font>

675
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,668
first thing is have an antivirus

676
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:47,699
solution so again there are too many

677
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:50,409
antivirus solution vendors out there

678
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,629
doing pen testing I've seen some of them

679
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:55,629
fault her a lot and some of them do a

680
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:57,189
decent job so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you're better</font>

681
00:22:55,629 --> 00:22:58,748
student to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect</font>

682
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,549
yourself then you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not right and it's</font>

683
00:22:58,749 --> 00:23:03,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">available on all platforms so you can</font>

684
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:05,559
use clam maybe you can use I don't know

685
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">semantics whatever your choice is I will</font>

686
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:09,340
mention there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a great site out there</font>

687
00:23:06,879 --> 00:23:11,649
av-comparatives org that you can go to

688
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,959
and they do third<font color="#E5E5E5"> party wise rigorous</font>

689
00:23:11,649 --> 00:23:16,149
testing on different solution providers

690
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,859
and they kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of rate them so every so</font>

691
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:19,658
often they'll give you a report on how

692
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:22,059
well antivirus is doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay for</font>

693
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:24,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">operating system and application updates</font>

694
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:27,158
so the thing I usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> follow is if i'm</font>

695
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:28,809
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> using an application or haven't used</font>

696
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:31,570
an application and a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks is gone</font>

697
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:33,849
right there there's no reason to have it

698
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:35,320
on their idea i love<font color="#E5E5E5"> like everybody else</font>

699
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:36,789
there might be something one thing that

700
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to hold on to because this does</font>

701
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:40,840
this one thing you do every six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months i</font>

703
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,779
as best you can to keep it updated so if

708
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:53,139
with just the installs versus having to

709
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:54,580
go to somewhere like majorgeeks or

710
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:55,809
somewhere else that it's got all these

711
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,279
links and you're like which one do i

713
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,609

718
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:11,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">out today best you can another example</font>

719
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:13,658
is your browser check from koalas so we

720
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:15,309
I mean everybody's you know vulnerable

721
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:17,950
to different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of browser extensions</font>

722
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:20,470
it be it you know Java scripts are

723
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:22,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking me java silverlight or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adobe</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">flash whatever it is you can go quickly</font>

725
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:25,960
to this site and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> to download</font>

726
00:24:24,489 --> 00:24:27,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything you just do a scam right there</font>

727
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,009
and see if any of your plugins or your

728
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,419
system is out of date so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the more we can</font>

729
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:32,979
keep up to date again you look at the

730
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:34,989
verizon data breach port that was a big

731
00:24:32,979 --> 00:24:36,369
problem for a lot of organizations as

732
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:38,799
keeping up with a patch management

733
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:40,359
configuration management so using those

734
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:44,529
tools to your benefit definitely goes a

735
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:46,809
long way another consideration to make

736
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:49,389
as well here safely removing cook

737
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:51,039
he's right so the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with cookies</font>

738
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:53,379
local shared objects right so you've got

739
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">them everywhere right it's not browser</font>

740
00:24:53,379 --> 00:24:56,889
just cookies right you got Flash cookies

741
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:58,779
you got silver like cookies you got all

742
00:24:56,889 --> 00:25:00,189
these various<font color="#E5E5E5"> objects they restore all</font>

00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:02,409
around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Machine what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

744
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:04,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">it well we can use tools like ccleaner</font>

745
00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:06,639
right as a solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes through</font>

746
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:09,039
across browsers because not everybody

747
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:10,269
uses just one browser as well as looking

748
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,769
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those local shared objects</font>

749
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:13,090
and removing some of that stuff bleach

750
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:15,070
bit if you're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux right so you can</font>

751
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:17,289
do these different options glary

752
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:19,360
utilities has some good options here as

753
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:21,639
well as even maintenance that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

754
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,139
use with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular tool onyx as</font>

755
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:25,178
well if you're on a Mac right so there's

756
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:26,369
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different options out there to</font>

757
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:28,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">get rid of some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those cookies</font>

758
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:29,678
choosing a better browser don't use

759
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:30,999
Internet Explorer I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously</font>

760
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,100
nobody really does for the separate work

761
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:34,629
right but use something like Firefox

762
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,178
there's lots of good plugins out there

763
00:25:34,629 --> 00:25:38,469
for Firefox it's my favorite I use

764
00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:39,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">chrome for a while and again I kind of</font>

765
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,070
go back and forth between these<font color="#E5E5E5"> two guys</font>

766
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:43,600
kind of love hate but definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

767
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:45,428
regards to these look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

768
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,860
tracking<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the providing options for</font>

769
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:50,350
control there in that regard<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font>

770
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,820
can also<font color="#CCCCCC"> use us things like trust no one</font>

771
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,559
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody used that before so it</font>

772
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,418
gives disinformation out on the browser

773
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:56,559
so when you do a search it doesn't

774
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:58,090
automatically interpret what you're

775
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,070
searching it just feeds it<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

776
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:02,439
so if it's keeping some information our

777
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:05,230
goal with trust no one is the concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

778
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:08,470
just providing extra extra noise as we

00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">go through our searching process Firefox</font>

780
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,830

strip

807
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,670
it's going to strip away that HTTPS

810
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,909
if there is a version of HTTPS out there

811
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,950
we're using that right verse right of

812
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:13,270
the page a full disk encryption can't

813

say enough about that course of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac</font>

814

you've got five all windows you got

815
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,800
BitLocker but then there's other options

816
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:19,630
out there for containers using something

817
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,129
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bear Creek so you can use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

818
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,390
like that as another solution for

00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,090
protecting that ho space machine

820
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:27,280
additional plugins web of<font color="#CCCCCC"> trust used to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">mention now nobody mentions it right got</font>

00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,820
pulled out of the Firefox browser

<font color="#CCCCCC">plug-in section because of the way that</font>

824
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,939
they were handling privacy practices and

825
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,409
that's the problem right you got all

826
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,630
these cool things that focus on privacy

827
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:38,740
look at adblock plus right now they're

828
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,690
starting to sell off to the highest

829
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,520
bidder right so you got to find measures

830
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:45,400
of change right that's what's going to

831
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,020
happen in security in general so<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

you block or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ball community is a</font>

833
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:51,700
better option than something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

834
00:27:48,190 --> 00:28:05,670
droite plus not going sure there we go

835
00:27:51,700 --> 00:28:05,670
right exactly right um so yes yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

836
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:14,110
yeah definitely use origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry for</font>

what you've got here as an option<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:27,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that right they're not going to go</font>

845
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,630
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> extra mile that it takes to go</font>

846
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,680
through all<font color="#CCCCCC"> those little layers that it</font>

847
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,210
takes to get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this stuff out</font>

848
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,770
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways to address that in</font>

849
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,690
a second also one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that just a no</font>

850
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:36,730
is the knots not on me if you're in web

851
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:38,380
applications you know what what kind of

852
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,790
stuff you're sending out to the

853
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,920
application server that can identify you

854
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:43,690
so it's a way to kind of take that away

855
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,940
a little bit and not help them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

856
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:47,290
identify what internet browser you're

857
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,700
using and what operating system you're

858
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,139
using you can use something like the

859
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,060
user agent switcher right to kind of

860
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,320
tell them you're in some version of

861
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">Linux when it's not linux or something</font>

862
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're using something else right this</font>

863
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,570
information is the best way to go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

864
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,340
mentioned tries attract me not there's

865
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously some privacy filters here a</font>

866
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,090
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that stuff's going around if I</font>

867
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,620
see the black mayor season<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on netflix</font>

868
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,780
right now there's a super creepy episode

869
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:10,419
there which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the third episode of</font>

870
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">season three and it deals with obviously</font>

871
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,880
the ability to kind of turn on the

872
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,280
webcam turn on the camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some of</font>

873
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,140
those

874
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,700
and now with<font color="#CCCCCC"> doughty's malware is not</font>

875
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,680
just as simple as looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the light</font>

876
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,540
anymore<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so some of those types of</font>

877
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,770
things their oversight is a pretty cool

878
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,240
tool if you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> used it before if</font>

879
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,950
it's on a mac<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it tries to access</font>

880
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,170
your camera or turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your internal</font>

881
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:28,970
microphone it'll pop up a message which

882
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:31,190
is pretty neat right active kind of a

883
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:33,950
host of detection a little snitch if

884
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:35,180
you're on a Mac<font color="#E5E5E5"> Great Firewall if you're</font>

885
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,770
on Windows<font color="#E5E5E5"> so something make me like</font>

886
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,060
zone alarm again the windows firewall is

887
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,710
decent you can add a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rules in</font>

888
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:42,020
there but you need a firewall to protect

889
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:44,690
you and then last pass right is in here

890
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:47,480
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> just having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some type of a</font>

891
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:49,040
password manager is a great way to fix

892
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,900
the problem with reuse of passwords

893
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,760
right you know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care what version</font>

894
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,520
to use just use something because

895
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,750
somethings better than nothing right

902
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,180
is a mess right<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody agree that</font>

903
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:13,010
right so with privacy and again I hope

904
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,290
nobody works for myself sorry anyway so

905
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:16,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">Windows 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a you know a lot and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

906
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:19,180
just put as much as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could on this one</font>

907
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">sly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's so many areas of</font>

908
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:24,350
interaction that Microsoft sends out

909
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:26,689
right it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeps some invasiveness</font>

910
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:29,270
right so things like location tracking

911
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:30,650
feedback you want to get microsoft Wi-Fi

912
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,930
sent who thought that was a good idea

913
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:35,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so those types of things I</font>

914
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:36,950
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understand Cortana listens to</font>

915
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,720
you all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time right so you know</font>

916
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,770
turning<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like that off again</font>

917
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,410
there's a really cool tool i'll mention

918
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:44,570
here oh and oh shut up<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 now again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

919
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:46,610
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> condone this tool because again I</font>

920
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:48,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't looked at it far enough but it</font>

921
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,570
is a tool that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of does all this</font>

922
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,220
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you right so if you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

923
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:54,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">a hassle with going through all the</font>

924
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,820
different settings changes if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want a</font>

925
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,740
simpler version just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of as a bar to</font>

926
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,970
slide over to turn on each<font color="#E5E5E5"> one or turn</font>

927
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:02,240
off each of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you can do</font>

928
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:04,010
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that okay but even you</font>

929
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,960
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just crazy and this has moved</font>

930
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:07,970
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people on two different</font>

931
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,880
platforms because of the mess<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what</font>

932
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:12,050
Windows 10 is kind of caused so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

933
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,370
some other things that we can do so

934
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:15,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't forget to sign out that's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big</font>

935
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,969
one obvious one I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to be more</font>

936
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:19,400
practical for moms and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pops as well so</font>

937
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:21,230
again you know teaching as long as i

938
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,640
have i've seen students that log<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with</font>

939
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,990
their gmail account and maybe just<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk</font>

940
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,910
out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not remember</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sign off</font>

941
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,870
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that or they'll leave</font>

942
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:28,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">there you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

943
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,169
and their desk just to run down to the

944
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,970
restroom or go get a drink or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

945
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:33,050
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not lock it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out so those</font>

946
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:35,090
are simple type of things that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

947
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:36,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even at home right is it becomes</font>

948
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:38,689
habit it just becomes habit so do that

949
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:40,389
turn off<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all about in the</font>

950
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:42,500
news and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a good one anyway</font>

951
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:44,440
same thing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet I mean in</font>

952
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:47,180
general that's a good practice to follow

953
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,920
secure file deletion right so by default

954
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,270
everybody should<font color="#CCCCCC"> know windows does not</font>

955
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,490
when you removed from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the recycle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bin</font>

956
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,750
does not get rid of everything right so

957
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,430
you got tools like recovery that you

958
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,630
could run and see if you can recover

959
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:59,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of that stuff that's been removed</font>

virtualization put those on there as

981
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:37,790
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that way you know again same</font>

982
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:39,439
thing you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug it in you don't have</font>

983
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,750
to actually install it<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the actual</font>

985
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,179
right how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many times you've you</font>

986
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,580
installed<font color="#E5E5E5"> something and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's try to</font>

987
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:49,580
install either changing your browser

00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:51,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">settings or changing your search</font>

989
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,330
provider installing some more crap<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

990
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:55,670
whatever it is so using something like

991
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:58,250
uncheck e to do unchecking all the boxes

992
00:32:55,670 --> 00:33:00,080
as you do the installation a secure

993
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">Drive wiping so using things like d</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> van</font>

994
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,010
or using something like kill disk right

995
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,449
those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really making sure that you</font>

996
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,650
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like a few years back with</font>

997
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,559
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stanford students when they got the</font>

998
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">xboxes from gamestop and we're able to</font>

999
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:12,290
pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> off the credit cards</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that were</font>

1000
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,580
stored on the drive so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make</font>

1001
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,070
sure you're killing your drives doing

1002
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:18,139
appropriately write a note mr. robot

1003
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:20,059
fans right so yes lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of good stuff</font>

1004
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:22,400
there you can pull off drives cloud

1005
00:33:20,059 --> 00:33:25,160
services like<font color="#CCCCCC"> SpiderOak so if you are</font>

1006
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:28,070
using cloud storage providers again the

1007
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,300
sentiment<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you are the</font>

1008
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:31,970
product right everybody knows that

1009
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:34,070
should know that and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the</font>

1010
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:35,840
customer and so a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the you know</font>

1011
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:37,100
the weight that weighs heavy on a lot of

1012
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,050
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a privacy perspective is</font>

1013
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,399
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> offer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero knowledge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1014
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:42,560
and a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> k</font>

1015
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,180
so we use services like spider oh and

1016
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,830
they do take a zero knowledge approach

1017
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:48,200
to the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they are you</font>

1018
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:50,110
know having so a lot of good<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1019
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,730
there from ways to protect yourself

1020
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:54,649
again I<font color="#CCCCCC"> realized a lot of stuff a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1021
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,720
stuff right so then I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on</font>

1022
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:58,550
smartphone privacy now I took the

1023
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,490
approach to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fruit right product</font>

1024
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:02,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Apple obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Android would have some</font>

1025
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,310
of these same kind of settings that you

1026
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,660
would want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to customize but again the</font>

1027
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,520
problem with these devices today they're

1028
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,230
making for convenience right and I keep

1029
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,719
adding all these new features which are

1030
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:12,889
amazing but the downside to some of

1031
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,779
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> features is they can leave</font>

1032
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:16,100
yourself exposed and so what I wanted to

1033
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:18,620
do is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a second here and kind</font>

1034
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,120
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at that now I my notes of course</font>

1035
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,980
I have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> links to things like</font>

1036
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,630
Apple's iOS pause the privacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy</font>

1037
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:25,790
which I recommend everybody read also

1038
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:27,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the FCC smartphones security checklist</font>

1039
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,239
again it's a good thing to follow if

1040
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,830
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to make sure you're at</font>

1041
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:32,120
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a baseline of what you would</font>

1042
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,949
expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a privacy perspective so</font>

1043
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,799
anyway just<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at these you're like</font>

1044
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:39,139
oh my gosh Apple is amazing at tracking

1045
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,700
stuff right same as Microsoft is or

1046
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:42,529
Windows is so you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

1047
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:43,549
advertising limit your ad tracking go

1048
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,360
through some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your phone here and</font>

1049
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,669
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see some of this stuff just</font>

1050
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,649
turned on just amazes me so looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1051
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,790
your apps and controlling what access

1052
00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:52,130
your apps have to things like your

1053
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:53,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">camera why does that happen eat access</font>

1054
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:55,880
to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera was that app need access to</font>

1055
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,800
my location all the time some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

1056
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:00,320
types of things I usually look to say

1057
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,810
never in most cases if I can if it says

1058
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,550
that it will always need access and it

1059
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,860
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me choose to only when the app</font>

1060
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,060
is loaded I will say no I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry so</font>

1061
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,470
those types of things you have to make

1062
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,960
an account for<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're willing to</font>

1063
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:13,759
sacrifice a little bit absent use your

1064
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,590
microphone apps that use your photos

1065
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,720
mean just stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just kind of</font>

1066
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:19,250
scary right how<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next to last</font>

1067
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,290
one right your Wi-Fi and that's the same

1068
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing with all devices a lot of times if</font>

1069
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:25,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">you connect somewhere like free Wi-Fi or</font>

1070
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:27,200
whatever it is it always<font color="#E5E5E5"> just connects</font>

1071
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,779
right and so everybody that don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend</font>

1072
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,430
test knows that and so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use lots</font>

1073
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:33,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">of different tools out there the scan</font>

1074
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:35,629
for people that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for networks</font>

1075
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,550
to connect it right and connect such so

1076
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,960
again the whole cloud methodology and

1077
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,490
some of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff there's also three</font>

1078
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,650
and privacy filters that you can apply

1079
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:44,180
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a lot of options we can do</font>

1080
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,220
now I made to slice just because there's

1081
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:48,620
too much stuff right so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> long does it</font>

1082
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:51,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep your messages look at using secure</font>

1083
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:53,089
messaging applications signal whisper

1084
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:54,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">chapstick ears crimp the cat there's</font>

1085
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,460
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of solutions</font>

1086
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,690
out there that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use and even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1087
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,900
your mail so look at using something

1088
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:02,150
like proton man right so Safari there's

1089
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,650
again a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things here does a you</font>

1090
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:06,680
know default wise from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a search engine</font>

1091
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:08,570
perspective cookies perspective blocking

1092
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,279
pop-ups is obvious who thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

1093
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:12,290
good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's store password right</font>

1094
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,120
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> again we don't really know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

1095
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:15,350
they are using that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information course</font>

1096
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,089
clear all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that information out now</font>

1097
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:18,230
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ran out of room so</font>

1098
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:20,990
here's some other stuff just to kind of

1099
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:22,640
have at it so the black<font color="#E5E5E5"> faux is not</font>

1100
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,859
doing as well but I do mention it here

1101
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,200
if we can find a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get just a plain</font>

1102
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:28,700
phone nowadays and then kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of looking</font>

1103
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,049
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of lock it down instead of</font>

1104
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">having all this bloatware and other</font>

1105
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:33,260
stuff that's added to the system again

1106
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,400
that's a good option<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though you</font>

1107
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:38,240
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it a good bit with the</font>

1108
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,770
black phone to turn off<font color="#CCCCCC"> Surrey so one of</font>

1109
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,970
the things here that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it kind</font>

1110
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:42,560
of silly about series you can tell

1111
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:44,089
Surrey to basically go to airplane mode

1112
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,770
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then if you're trying to remotely</font>

1113
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:47,450
connect to your device because some i

1114
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,590
stoled it you can't get to it right same

1115
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,640
thing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the control center right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1116
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,140
put that probably somewhere in here as

1117
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,629
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can flip that control center up</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the guy that couldn't get onto the phone</font>

1122
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,710
loaded up the whole storage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:04,610
all these photos that he had to go

through and<font color="#E5E5E5"> delete of the device so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1126
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,700
it's a trick you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's funny but</font>

1133
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,970
judging from the crowd<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know how</font>

many half kids or don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids or</font>

1135
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:29,089
maybe you just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of control</font>

1136
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:31,370
your roommates right they do some crazy

1137

stuff after all<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe they're using</font>

00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:34,130
your stuff right<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that crazy stuff</font>

1139
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:35,990
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you wanna have a little bit of</font>

1140
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:39,200
control things like k9 web protection or

1141
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:40,879
have a content filter in place you know

1142
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,560
those are good solutions to make again

1143
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,660
if you can you can afford it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font>

1144
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,430
put it in place I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a pfsense</font>

1145
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,379
firewall or small box that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can run</font>

1146
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,759
pfsense those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all good solutions as</font>

1147
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,920
well if you can add some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that content</font>

1148
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,200
manageability inside there there's also

1149
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">just being a dad myself found a lot of</font>

1150
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">different apps that are out there that</font>

1151
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:59,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">can control screen time stuff and even</font>

1152
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet devices now that you can</font>

1153
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,110
basically go things and do things like

1154
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,640
pause the internet you can set

1155
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:06,290
restrictions to a time windows when the

1156
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,799
internet is available or not so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1157
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,300
do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of cool things today definitely</font>

1158
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,800
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> good and then also privacy</font>

1159
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">grade org so there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of sites like</font>

1160
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,670
privacy a grade basical what it does is

1161
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">it looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the apps that you install</font>

1162
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,670
and it gives them a rating based off of

1163
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,290
privacy who doesn't want that right

1164
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,760
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we are owes were a nap</font>

1165
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,500
generation we're always installing lots

1166
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,360
and lots and absent you might not know

1167
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly what those apps do obviously</font>

1168
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,750
implementing something like Open DNS

1169
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:29,310
great content filtering mechanism and a

1170
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,590
great book for any parent out there

1171
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:33,330
that's trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a handle of some of</font>

1172
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:37,140
this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the kids do outsmarting</font>

1173
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:38,700
your kids online right makes sense so

1174
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:41,549
anonymize networks another thing to

1175
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:45,419
consider oops I think I shall pass one

1176
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:46,530
sorry controlling spam so there's a lot

1177
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do so for the first</font>

1178
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:50,970
thing why don't we want to click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1179
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,560
subscribe right here right I think it's

1180
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:54,209
maybe kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of obvious right by</font>

1181
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,070
responding to something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to the</font>

1182
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:58,710
email you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving that positive</font>

1183
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:00,510
confirmation and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the rate at</font>

1184
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:02,970
which you do it as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as an important</font>

1185
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:04,680
factor to it so a lot of times of the

1186
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:05,939
people that push out a lot of that spam

1187
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,830
they don't care if you unsubscribe or

1188
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,090
not now<font color="#CCCCCC"> so again I understand it's a</font>

1189
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:10,740
part of their policy that they have to

1190
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:12,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">follow that and that might be true but a</font>

1191
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,640
lot of times it's not right so a lot of

1192
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,020
that is extra effort that we've now gone

1193
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,250
through and confirmed ourselves not only

1194
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,300
confirmed herself but now they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can sell</font>

1195
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,040
our information off this is a real

1196
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,840
account live account and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font>

1197
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,910
they are very interactive with this

1198
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:26,460
account so again be careful<font color="#CCCCCC"> with doing</font>

1199
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:28,859
stuff like that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what it</font>

1200
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,030
entails now another thing here limit<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1201
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,820
sharing of your email address again

1202
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:35,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't use your real stuff right it is</font>

1203
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,540
far as I'm concerned your email address

1204
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:40,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">should not have something that's</font>

1205
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:43,140
recognizable by somebody that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is gonna</font>

1206
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,000
know your name<font color="#E5E5E5"> so not to say that you're</font>

1207
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,470
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very crafty email</font>

1208
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,150
address that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> offensive to</font>

1209
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,069
anyone but you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something</font>

1210
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:52,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not linked directly to write</font>

1211
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:54,060
obvious so if you have control<font color="#E5E5E5"> over that</font>

1212
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:57,450
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that and then in this</font>

1213
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:59,490
case if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do maybe in this case you</font>

1214
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:01,379
use an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email service that's not that you</font>

1215
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,819
pay for write something that is not free

1216
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,410
because again like I said back at the

1217
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:06,750
concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not paying</font>

1218
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:08,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">for it you're the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> product right don't</font>

1219
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,180
post<font color="#E5E5E5"> your email address on websites this</font>

1220
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,890
is a hard one<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a lot of companies</font>

1221
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,540
right in time I do a pen test if I'm

1222
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,400
doing recons first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do a spider</font>

1223
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,200
the site try to find emails right or go

1224
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,630
on linkedin try to find emails and so a

1225
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,950
lot of times<font color="#E5E5E5"> I as a company if there's</font>

1226
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,530
not policies that govern some of this

1227
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:23,109
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> accept</font>

1228
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:24,490
we use is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a way that in this</font>

1229
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">case we can enforce something like that</font>

1230
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:27,609
from an organization for Spectre so we

1231
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:29,710
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider that for own personal</font>

1232
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:32,200
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> right just don't put your real email</font>

1233
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,400
address out there things like use a

1234
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,750
disposable email of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

1235
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,670
another site are mentioned shark lasers

1236
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:38,050
to you guys earlier I use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1237
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,580
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> classes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because we'll do a lot of</font>

trial<font color="#E5E5E5"> software's like Nessa sorcerer are</font>

1239
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,390
not necessary that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll have the</font>

1240
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,279
students go through and use like a fakey

1241
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:47,710
message I mean again just so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can</font>

1242
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,450
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of try out the software other</font>

1243
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:51,040
things they're reporting spam don't

1244
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:52,839
click any of the links be careful with

1245
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,580
the links<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can instantly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just copy a</font>

1248
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:00,069
can scan the URL from another

1249
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,660
third-party versus having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to click on it</font>

1250
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:02,770
right it's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> a better practice to</font>

1251
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:05,109
do something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that watch out for</font>

1252
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:06,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">check boxes and of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some</font>

1253
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:08,770
spam filtering services you can use kind

1254
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:10,750
of proxy out your mail anonymize

1255
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:13,390
networks a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things here of course</font>

1256
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:14,920
the Tor project I to pee the idea of

1257
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:16,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">using these networks everybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinks</font>

1258
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,310
these networks are we and in ugly and

1259
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:20,140
stuff then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's dark net whatever it is</font>

1260
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:22,060
everybody does illegal things on these

1261
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,319
but a lot of times it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy</font>

1262
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:26,650
prone people that might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> using these</font>

1263
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:28,750
networks now I to<font color="#CCCCCC"> P is relatively or not</font>

1264
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,100
related<font color="#E5E5E5"> new but it's not as used as much</font>

1265
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:32,050
as the Tor project as far as I can tell

1266
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,920
but either one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these solutions really</font>

1267
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:36,040
good and I also want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring your</font>

1268
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:37,750
attention to privacy browsers so epic<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1269
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know if white hat has there's</font>

1270
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:41,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">anymore it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called aviator also</font>

1271
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:44,110
browse are all of those are browsers

1272
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:46,330
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on privacy efforts so</font>

1273
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:48,370
not having to go through the effort of

1274
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:49,330
and the Firefox settings changing

1275
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:50,920
everything from a security perspective

1276
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:52,509
now I like that because it's a lot more

1277
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">hands on but everybody's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

1278
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,360
like that so using something like epic

1279
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:57,520
browser might be a better option for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1280
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,780
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that case also use proxy lists right</font>

1281
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,270
so if you've got tools that you can use

1282
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:03,460
like proxy chains or something else find

1283
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:05,200
a good proxy list that's anonymizing

1284
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:08,530
your traffic and then maybe that's an

1285
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,930
option as well a lot of VPN sites also

1286
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:12,640
produce those a<font color="#E5E5E5"> proxy list for free to</font>

1287
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,899
use so any of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that type</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff that</font>

1288
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,790
kind of anonymous some of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

1289
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,430
connections as well as operating system

1290
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:20,290
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> cubis s cube less entails both of</font>

1291
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:21,850
those solutions are really good from an

1292
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:23,560
anonymized perspective from a privacy

1293
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:25,240
perspective so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

1294
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,279
tracking everything something like a

1295
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,649
Windows 10 would a lot of good<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font>

1296
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,630
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> tails it keeps a little bit newer I</font>

1297
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,950
guess in regards to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but both of</font>

1298
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,760
those solutions really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1299
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,529
sandbox

1300
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's amazing application virtualization</font>

1301
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:39,190
you can do for sandboxing on a windows

1302
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:40,750
based system so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have our</font>

1303
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:42,160
get back a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more control of</font>

1304
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:43,840
the applications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> run in windows you</font>

1305
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,549
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now of course Microsoft is</font>

1306
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,440
trying to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now with a lot of</font>

1307
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:48,730
their micro virtualization that they're

1308
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing and things like Windows 10 but</font>

1309
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:52,270
again a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are very weary of</font>

1310
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:53,620
Windows 10 in its virtualization and was

1311
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,660
speaking a virtualization that's another

1312
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:58,000
layer that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can add there from a</font>

1313
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:59,319
protection perspective as well so credit

1314
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,450
card information sharing a lot of

1315
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:03,190
information here and controlling it so

1316
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:05,230
prevent that you're approved junk mail

1317
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:07,180
who doesn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that crap right thirty</font>

1318
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:09,730
thousand dollar loan I just go ahead and

1319
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:11,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">take it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to my bank right and so those</font>

1320
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:12,220
are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of things that concern me</font>

1321
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,390
so here you can go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular</font>

1322
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:16,509
site<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're starting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

1323
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:18,190
mail and you can opt out online for a

1324
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:20,140
small period of time but then opt out

1325
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:21,400
permanently if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go ahead and do it</font>

1326
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,410
through males so some of those services

1327
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,660
get a free reddit report that's your

1328
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:27,129
right and so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that and all as</font>

1329
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,799
well as you can pray place a fraud alert

1330
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:31,480
for 90 days or pray place of a freeze I

1331
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,130
don't know but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the state</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1332
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,110
South Carolina is free to do that yes

1333
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:37,090
okay perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> so those are good options</font>

1334
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:38,650
and then get reusable reusable credit

1335
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:40,300
cards right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you get them at walmart</font>

1336
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:42,310
wherever some places let you even pay

1337
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,290
cash for these reusable credit cards so

1338
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:47,250
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea there is it's not linked</font>

1339
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:47,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">directly to good</font>

1340
00:43:55,550 --> 00:44:00,990
good to know yes absolutely but<font color="#CCCCCC"> try and</font>

1341
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:03,660
try those toys options are always good

1342
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:06,149
options to follow if I heard of privacy

1343
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:08,279
calm very cool site again I don't know

1344
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:09,510
if it's open invite or not but basically

1345
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,010
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does this it creeps temporary</font>

1346
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:12,570
credit cards for every online

1347
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:14,580
transaction that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make in that pretty</font>

1348
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:15,750
cool so those types of things kind of

1349
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,890
like blur does a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit with your</font>

1350
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">credit card but even if taking it to the</font>

1351
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:20,640
next level those are cool services that

1352
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:23,630
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use for anonymizing</font>

1353
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:27,120
yourself a little bit further<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1354
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:28,650
social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media so again this is probably a</font>

1355
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,620
stab in the heart so to speak for a lot

1356
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:33,300
of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> yours this generation so ideally</font>

1357
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:35,490
social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand it it's</font>

1358
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,440
awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I use Twitter literally on</font>

1359
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:39,359
a daily basis I really do<font color="#CCCCCC"> enjoy it a lot</font>

1360
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,580
but if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes down to the point</font>

1361
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:44,010
between yourself and privacy and looking

1362
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:47,370
at the concerns of some of that how how

1363
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:49,080
how evasive these particular types of

1364
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:51,750
technologies and these services are is

1365
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:54,690
out of control so I'm always having to

1366
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:56,040
go into my facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy policies and</font>

1367
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:58,290
privacy settings and make sure they're

1368
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,730
not turning some new feature on right so

1369
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:01,110
that's kind of a pain in the butt but it

1370
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:03,240
definitely is important go to the

1371
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:05,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">privacy settings at the first step you</font>

1372
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">can also go into facebook under your</font>

1373
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:08,850
settings a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times people will sign</font>

1374
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:11,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">on with their the apps that they</font>

1375
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:13,170
download with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook so that's always</font>

1376
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:15,000
a bad option right it's convenient

1377
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,960
option but it's a bad option because now

1378
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,270
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> giving that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

1379
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,830
application full certain controls over

app and signed on with it with Facebook

1384

take it on their block it and don't

1407
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:10,230
good

1408
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,050
awk kind of introducing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to what kind</font>

1409
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:14,760
of thought behind investigative process

1410
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:16,770
is now used in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this social landscape</font>

1411
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we use today and then another thing</font>

is depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your level of</font>

1413
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:23,490
professionalism so like I separate all

1414
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,740
these accounts if it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> linked in if I</font>

1420
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:36,930

1423
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:42,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody so you know maybe setting up</font>

1424
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:43,680
that separation those layers depending

1425
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:47,250
on the service you use is another good

1426
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,990
thing to think about hmm so we need to

1427
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:50,490
control herself as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see there's</font>

1428
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:52,979
lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that around</font>

1429
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:56,250
here so let's look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

1430
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:58,410
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so most sites today have an opt-out</font>

1431
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:00,839
measure and so I mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> spokeo i</font>

1432
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:02,250
mentioned pipl<font color="#E5E5E5"> com both of those in the</font>

1433
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:03,869
introduction so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went through the</font>

1434
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:05,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">process or removing myself from the</font>

1435
00:47:03,869 --> 00:47:07,260
internet your best option<font color="#CCCCCC"> is find a</font>

1436
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,848
buddy right so you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody else</font>

1437
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,770
with the same privacy concerns as you

1438
00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:12,630
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you see how much</font>

1439
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:14,009
information they can find on you and you

1440
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:16,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">find out as much information as you can</font>

1441
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:18,210
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> them and then you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go in it like a</font>

1442
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,919
teamwork kind of thing and that's much

1443
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:22,589
funner that way rather than doing it

1444
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,780
yourself it will be a process I promise

1445
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:28,200
you guys getting your privacy back is

1446
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,940
not a for the faint of heart there is a

1447
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,930
paid service that I've put my notes to

1448
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:34,680

1451
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:41,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">dollars but again you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decide is</font>

1452
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:43,560
it worth that to go through that go cost

1453
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:45,300
of you or is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting which I</font>

1454
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,890
again being a hacker I love those kind

1455
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:48,329
of things I like to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out as much as</font>

1456
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:50,368
I can about things I like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through</font>

1457
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:51,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">the process right so here's all the</font>

1458
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:53,490
sites and just kind of a lot of

1459
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:56,700
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here what you'll find</font>

1460
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:58,229
is that every site pipl com or spokeo

1461
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,029
com any of these sites where they track

1462
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:02,099
you sometimes they'll give where they

1463
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:03,599
found you from and then you can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1464
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:04,740
go to that site<font color="#CCCCCC"> and see if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they have an</font>

1465
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,260
opt-out so definitely look at those

1466
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:09,240
types of things again just delete me is

1467
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:12,480
another good place to go to find where

1468
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,618
those opt outs are located as well as we

1469
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,780
have to be concerned about data

1470
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:17,520
marketers right so again like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1471
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:20,040
you're not paying<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your the product</font>

1472
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,060
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideally a one example is the</font>

1473
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">value packs right</font>

1474
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,330
if you get mail somewhere you might be

1475
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting a lot of those little blue</font>

1476
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:27,990
envelopes that have lots of coupons that

1477
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,250
nobody uses right so you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of</font>

1478
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:30,899
opt out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some of those types</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1479
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:32,850
services and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here's some great places</font>

1480
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,890
to go as well as safe<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shepherd is</font>

1481
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:37,290
another place so chef efforts a shepherd

1482
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:39,210
calm will allow you a proactive way to

1483
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:40,590
remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> your personal information from</font>

1484
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:42,540
the internet from these marketing

1485
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:44,220
databases so again being that more

1486
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:47,610
proactive person is definitely going to

1487
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:49,740
go a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> way as well as the telephone</font>

1488
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:51,000
stuff so if you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see that a lot</font>

1489
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,799
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information your home phone</font>

1490

00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,890
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that stuff is online and</font>

1492
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:57,750
available to you start getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1493
00:48:55,890 --> 00:49:00,210
you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce the amount of</font>

1494
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:01,530

1498
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:10,200
types of services also things like

1499
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:11,759
simple stuff you can try if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1500
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,649
not be discoverable if you have to call

1501
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,510
somebody for some reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do the</font>

1502
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:17,760
star 67 to kind of do the no caller ID

1503
