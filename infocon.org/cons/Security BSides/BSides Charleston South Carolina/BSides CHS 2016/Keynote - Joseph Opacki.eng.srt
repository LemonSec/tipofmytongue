54
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,730
right so I got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long history working in</font>

55
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,320
cyber crime so I was pretty excited when

56
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,609
Dave contact me and gave me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

60
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,630
I've tried to go to bsides

61
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,430
internationally and it's a great

62
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:32,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">community of individual so I'm happy you</font>

63
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:35,300
guys were here<font color="#E5E5E5"> today too I have a long</font>

64
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,450
history in cyber crime like I just said

65
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,710
in fact I started working on cyber

66
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,030
investigations back in the 90s when I

67
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">worked for an organization called the</font>

68
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,840
overseas Security Advisory Council at

69
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,390
diplomatic security at the US Department

70
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,910
of State and since then I pretty much

71
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,130
been addicted in fact I didn't start in

72
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,140
security as you guys pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much know I</font>

73
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,480
started in computer science I started as

74
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,190
a software engineer and pretty much like

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,690
my other software engineers like kicked

76
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,820
me to the curb just kept on break in

77
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,520
their applications right anyone here

78
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,320
brake applications right so there's a

79
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,970
pretty much established name for it now

80
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,859
right it's like computer network exploit

81
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,840
you know computer network attack you

82
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,430
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever quality assurance whatever</font>

83
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,260
you want to name it I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fuzz</font>

84
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,660
things in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to plasma have</font>

85
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,510
applications a lot and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still continue</font>

86
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:23,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do it today so I enjoy that type of</font>

87
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:27,470
work however I'm really excited to see

88
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:29,180
how the industry has pretty much evolved

89
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,000
over the last 20 years since i started

90
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,340
doing cyber threat investigations from

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,530
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i went on and i continue my work</font>

92
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,320
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i spent a long career in US</font>

93
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,519
government essentially working on

94
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,829
investigating cyber criminals in fact

95
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,780
the last 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> years of my life before I</font>

96
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,970
came into the private sector were spent

97
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,860
in the FBI in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> i started off the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FBI</font>

98
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,630
worked in the cyber division and then i

99
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,190
moved on to something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called operational</font>

100
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,709
technology to division and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

101
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,769
retired<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was the technical director of</font>

102
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:59,420
advanced digital forensics at the FBI's

103
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:01,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">advanced digital forensic program right</font>

104
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,170
so they have long titles in the FBI

105
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:06,290
and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of bureaucracy if you guys</font>

106
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:08,359
have read the news so I retired from the

107
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">FBI a couple years ago and from there I</font>

108
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,770
went out and I took a private sector job

109
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,230
at a company called<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyesight partner you</font>

110
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:17,840
guys familiar with outside partners

111
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,488
anyone all right good so I site partners

112
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,079
they're one of the first like cyber

113
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:23,179
threat intelligence companies which

114
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,159
focuses on true intelligence collection

115
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,200
methodologies and so pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much I was</font>

116
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,630
the senior director of debt research

117
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,210
where I site partners my job there was

118
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:35,180
to pretty much collect unique cyber

119
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:39,109
information that targeted our clients

120
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,940
right I had some life changes decided I

121
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,410
want to move on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and me and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wife no</font>

122
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,180
longer wanted to live<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the Washington</font>

123
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,620
DC area because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was becoming quite</font>

124
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,390
overcrowded and it was starting to

125
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,950
become election season so I started

126
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,349
looking for a job and<font color="#CCCCCC"> my wife gave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

127
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:54,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">two options she said go to the mountains</font>

128
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,940
or go to the ocean right and so I've

129
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">been fortunate enough to find Charleston</font>

130
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,000
South Carolina and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

131
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,920
year and a half and I absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> love it</font>

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,350
if you look outside the ocean is right

133
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,910
there right and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know setting the</font>

134
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:09,290
Hurricanes aside everything else has

135
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:10,880
been absolutely wonderful right so today

136
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,970
I want to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something which is</font>

137
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,920
overlooked besides<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot to say this</font>

138
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,090
I'm sorry so besides that government

139
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,680
work and the work I did in the private

140
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,989
sector I also got a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> history in</font>

141
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,910
academia so I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been teaching at George</font>

142
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,770
Mason University for like the last six

143
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">years the master computer forensics</font>

144
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,620

forming the curriculum necessary to

149
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,600

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,630
a critical critical crisis of talent in

154
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,780
fact it's even harder for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us down here</font>

155
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:52,250
in the south because we're not

156
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,960
developing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my opinion the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talent pool</font>

157
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,450
in this area the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we necessarily</font>

158
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,000
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop people in this talent</font>

159
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:00,770
pool we need cyber people like if you

160
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,180
work locally you work<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the South you</font>

161
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,340
work in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know southern part</font>

162
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,990

163
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">just some primary locations where you</font>

164
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,590
have to find in<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand pick individuals</font>

165
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,240
and pray<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they relocate to where</font>

166
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,580
your company's at right if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

167
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,470
them work

168
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,300
remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's a problem and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

169
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:19,250
that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rethink our strategy</font>

170
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,840
their overall today I want to talk about

171
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">what a lot of people overlook and this</font>

172
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,888
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially the infection vector</font>

173
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,780
right and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of time looking</font>

174
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:30,120
at infection<font color="#E5E5E5"> factors in fact when I was</font>

175
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,789
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bureau I spent 10 years as the</font>

176
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,439
SME<font color="#E5E5E5"> and mal reverse engineering and when</font>

177
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:36,599
I was at George Mason I<font color="#E5E5E5"> taught the</font>

178
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,909
marrow reverse engineering class for the

179
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:40,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">graduate program and so I've got a lot</font>

180
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:43,319
of experience reverse engineering

181
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,610
malware I love it but I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font>

182
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,050
assembly and anyone who looks at

183
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,300
assembly for more than like five years

184
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,340
knows your brain<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of begins to rot</font>

185
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:54,120
right and you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start doing other</font>

186
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:56,219
things not only that but like every time

187
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,330
you find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know you can break</font>

188
00:06:56,219 --> 00:07:01,800
some like anti disassembly technique new

189
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,419
malware payload comes out you got to

190
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,830
like start all over again in fact new

191
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,539
malware payloads come out faster than

192
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:10,198
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can reverse engineering and it's</font>

193
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:12,599
quite a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so after spending</font>

194
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,029
all the time looking at malware I

195
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,800
decided to refocus like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to say</font>

196
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:19,259
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what how many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here know</font>

197
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,860
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber kill chain is Lockheed Martin</font>

198
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:24,090
does because they trademarked it anyone

199
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,710
who knows about the cyber kill trade

200
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,020
knows like the whole primary point of

201
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:30,839
the cyber kill chain is to try to

202
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,460
prevent the initial tap right and pretty

203
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,650
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> it lays it out it's like hey here</font>

204
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,508
are the stages<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the attack and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

205
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,120
fishlabs we have this kind of mentality

206
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:40,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's like why don't we do things</font>

207
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,629
proactively so that we can prevent

208
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,219
attack all together<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact what we call</font>

209
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,839
the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the attack is what a</font>

210
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:48,389
lot of people know as the infection

211
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,680
vector if you can prevent the initial

212
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:52,199
attack from happening then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

213
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,639
prevent all the badness from happening

214
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,479
following the tack and that's really

215
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,889
important concept so instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

216
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,080
reactionary it's important for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

217
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:03,210
refocus and say hey let's prevent that

218
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,430
all together right let's get rid of it

219
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,719
and if we can get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it then we</font>

220
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:13,229
won't have as bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it taxes we do so</font>

221
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:16,800
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where 90% of all</font>

222
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:18,240
malware infections come from well it's

223
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">not fair if you work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for me thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

224
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,009
very much anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

225
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:25,229
anybody else fishing it's absolutely

226
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:28,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">true now here's the problem of fishing</font>

227
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:30,209
right everybody and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you guys will</font>

228
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,769
tell me it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> true everybody pretty much</font>

229
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,750
takes fishing and they kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of scoop it</font>

230
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:35,610
underneath the rug why it's been around

231
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,250
for a long time fishing it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security</font>

232
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,620
awareness issue you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> harden I mean</font>

233
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,568
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a larger issue than you</font>

234
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,979
think right so you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like scoot</font>

235
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:45,810
it under the rug you can't implement

236
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:49,050
some technology and the reason why is

237
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:51,719
fishing is not a technical issue fishing

238
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,758
is a social engineering issue it's

239
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,379
essentially an attack which tries to

240
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,750
social engineer the person who sits

241
00:08:55,379 --> 00:09:00,209
behind the keyboard and while you can

242
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,670
implement technologies to try to limit

243
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:05,279
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack you're never going to fully</font>

244
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,290
get rid of these attacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happen on</font>

245
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,420
zero day things are always going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

246
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,339
through the system right so ninety

247
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent of malware infections start with</font>

248
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,759
fishing and fishing is one hundred

249
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:16,410
percent of social engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack</font>

250
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,259
going after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user behind the keyboard</font>

251
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:22,589
the user behind the keyboard is largely

252
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:26,750
responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for infecting the operating</font>

253
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:30,389
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> of which they operate on right so</font>

254
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:32,189
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that we've given them all the</font>

255
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:33,959
training that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we needed to give them we</font>

256
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:35,910
give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer-based training we</font>

257
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:37,439
give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> info SEC training we give them</font>

258
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,509
all the training<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says don't click</font>

259
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:41,250
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the links but fishings not like that</font>

260
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:44,699
anymore and we have to stop thinking

261
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">about fishing as that that clicking on</font>

262
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:47,189
the link program that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

263
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement security awareness training</font>

264
00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:53,389
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get away from right</font>

265
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:56,069
everybody in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world has an innate</font>

266
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:57,959
psychologic response to information

267
00:09:56,069 --> 00:10:02,009
that's in front<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them they want to say</font>

268
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:05,099
hey this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is true</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't care who you</font>

269
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:07,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact it's stuck on studies have</font>

270
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">shown that one out of five phishing</font>

271
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:11,850
attacks that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the end user</font>

272
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,040
results in a malware infection one out

273
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,350
of five and you're never going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font>

274
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,930
all fishing you're never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop</font>

275
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,879
it from reaching your end users so do

276
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:25,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to take that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chance do you</font>

277
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:29,220
really so how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in here know</font>

278
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:31,050
about fishing like do you know about

279
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,800
fishing or you know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> fishing</font>

280
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,750
because I'd know about fish

281
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,029
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't didn't really know about</font>

282
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,910
fishing with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> quotes until recently</font>

283
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:42,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so I'm gonna talk a little bit</font>

284
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,660
about what makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a really advanced</font>

285
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,160
fishing campaign and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a</font>

286
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,410
little bit about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the anti</font>

287
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,630
analysis techniques used in fishing

288
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,160
campaigns and then more important excuse

289
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,230
me more<font color="#E5E5E5"> importantly I want to talk a</font>

290
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,850
little bit about investigative

291
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,810
techniques used in cyber threat

292
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,180
intelligence I want to talk about

293
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:00,790
investigative techniques to go after the

294
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:03,130
actors associated with cyber<font color="#CCCCCC"> crime and</font>

295
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,620
trying to make big impacts into the

296
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:08,490
economies that essentially make up these

297
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:13,540
cryptic criminal infrastructures right

298
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:15,519
so largely there's two types of fishing

299
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,170
in my opinion there's what's called

300
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">consumer-focused fishing which goes</font>

301
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,069
after your consumers and then there's

302
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:22,660
called something called<font color="#E5E5E5"> spearfishing</font>

303
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,050
which goes after your employees and

304
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,939
pretty much spearfishing is

305
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:30,279
unfortunately synonymous with something

306
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">called a PTA and nation state in fact</font>

307
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:35,019
there's a clear delineation between

308
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,510
spearfishing advanced persistent threats

309
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:40,120
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> nation-state activity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and</font>

310
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,770
unfortunately because a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us don't</font>

311
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,720
really delve in that area there's the

312
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:46,329
big confusion right spearfishing

313
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,579
definitely delivers these advanced

314
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:50,949
persistent threats spearfishing is

315
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:53,290
definitely used by nation state actors

316
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,450
however that's the only thats not the

317
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,189
only type of spearfishing how many

318
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:01,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">people here know what business email</font>

319
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:03,459
compromise is wailing CEO scamming CNO

320
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,680
CEO impersonation that's a spear fish

321
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:08,439
right in fact that's not even a really

322
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,939
technically complex crime it's basically

323
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,610
a social engineer attack and

324
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,110
impersonation of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level figure but</font>

325
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,520
that's spearfishing but I wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

326
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,500
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nation-state I would even say</font>

327
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,089
that that's advanced persistent threat I

328
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,100
just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an attack against your</font>

329
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:23,649
employee base which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what spearfishing</font>

330
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,410
is so my point here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a</font>

331
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:28,180
large percentage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of there's a large</font>

332
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">percentage of activity that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> falls within</font>

333
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,560
this domain right if you think about it

334
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,290
everything from banking<font color="#E5E5E5"> charge and</font>

335
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,569
activity everything from scamming and

336
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,910
impersonation advanced persistent threat

337
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:42,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">nation-state activity it all begins with</font>

338
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:45,459
the same infection vector right fishing

339
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,910
now how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here a get fishing</font>

340
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:50,349
training

341
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:53,980
fishing training how many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

342
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:55,630
get fishing simulation training it was

343
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">like the annoying email or they try to</font>

344
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:00,310
like get you into clicking the link yeah

345
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:02,829
it's painful<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's less than one-eighth</font>

346
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,660
of the room quite literally so think

347
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,580
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it less than one eighth of the</font>

348
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:11,770
room focus this is on this problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

349
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:14,470
it's a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> true about</font>

350
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:16,960
fishing and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus first on</font>

351
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,030
consumer focus fishing the largest

352
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,950
percent of fishing is all financially

353
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:23,890
incentivized in fact a large amount of

354
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:27,280
fishing is all built upon credential

355
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:30,580
theft so if you actually get fish with a

356
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,920
spam lure then the whole focus there is

357
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,380
to steal your account credentials and

358
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,150
that's something that's tried and true

359
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">and is probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to change</font>

360
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:42,160
anytime in the future however there are

361
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,890
things that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing trending over</font>

362
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,569
the last couple years for example while

363
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,449
the banking industry or the financial

364
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:51,340
sectors are largely the number one the

365
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,620
one number one<font color="#E5E5E5"> target we've seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

366
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">large-scale increase the number of</font>

367
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,450
targets against cloud sharing

368
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:01,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">file-sharing social media web mail and</font>

369
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:03,640
the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why is because there's this</font>

370
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,300
thing called account reuse right how

371
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:10,750
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have a yahoo account well no</font>

372
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:13,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">now right so they're like so but if you</font>

373
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:16,510
had a yahoo account ever then you got a

374
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:18,100
problem because you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be honest when</font>

375
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,830
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked this question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I do this</font>

376
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,540
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people use the same</font>

377
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:27,430
username and password in multiple

378
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:29,620
locations yeah exactly so if I fish your

379
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,640
account credentials in one location then

380
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,320
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm going to do I'm going</font>

381
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,650
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it on financial institution</font>

382
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,200
because I'm hoping that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

383
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:40,780
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that same account credential for</font>

384
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,190
your online banking and when you do I'm

385
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,680
gonna go steal all your money well not

386
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">me baby me I don't know cybercriminals</font>

387
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:52,000
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so where are all the</font>

388
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,530
targets right this is a big thing so

389
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,600
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last couple years largely</font>

390
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:57,819
fishing targeted the United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

391
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,720
because the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> y-12</font>

392
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,490
financial

393
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,069
wasn't it right it quite literally is

394
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:07,529
and we all know that however<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

395
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:09,639
we've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> so because we've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

396
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:11,410
overloaded with phishing attacks in the

397
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:13,569
last couple years there's been shifts to

398
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,759
other parts of the world right no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer</font>

399
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:17,199
is the United States just the mega

400
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:18,490
capital of fishing there are other

401
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,219
places<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are being fished pretty</font>

402
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:23,230
intensely in fact China has a four

403
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,060
hundred percent increase in phishing

404
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,860
attacks this last year that's four

405
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,209
hundred percent and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

406
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,089
because China is try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do more</font>

407
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:33,910
essentially trying to work with private

408
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:37,379
sector outside China's walls right it

409
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:40,959
also opens them up to a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks</font>

410
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:43,060
so how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> here want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font>

411
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,518
how to start a successful fishing

412
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,229
campaign all right I'll give your names

413
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:53,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">and numbers for the FBI afterwards</font>

414
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:55,990
please so let's start with this how many

415
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:58,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">people in your pen test yeah I love pen</font>

416
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:01,629
testing I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> hockey I'm sorry same</font>

417
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:03,279
thing so if you pen test if you're truly

418
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:04,689
trying to break down an organization

419
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,800
then the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you're going to do</font>

420
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:07,569
is you probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see how</font>

421
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,829
vulnerable they are and so you're going

422
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:11,259
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> collecting information about</font>

423
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:13,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">them and I got to tell you pen testing</font>

424
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:15,699
today is a lot different than past pen

425
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:18,100
testing 20 years ago now there's all

426
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:19,540
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools technologies platforms</font>

427
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,370
that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use to do pen testing</font>

428
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,569
there's a lot of expensive classes at

429
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,870
black hat that know if you've really

430

taken less they're millionaires so

431
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,750
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of great free tools right</font>

432
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,449
in fact I've got one up here how many

433
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">people ever use email harvester before</font>

434
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:35,410
yeah I'll need your names to please so

435
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:36,759
if you ever used email harvester before

436
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,769
you know that you can point it out of

437
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:39,910
domain and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> result of the action is</font>

438
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:41,740
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

439
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,709
exposed email addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how</font>

440
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:46,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">easy it is to collect email addresses</font>

441
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:49,719
how many organizations have email

442
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:54,490
addresses out there of their staff

443
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:57,639
members all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them that everyone's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

444
00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:00,250
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know maybe yeah so as fact and</font>

445
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,689
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the primary points of BC's like</font>

446
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,069
the impersonation scans we were talking

447
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:04,599
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the ability to define</font>

448
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:07,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">high-level members of your organization</font>

449
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:09,569
and then find their email addresses

450
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:12,780
then use that email<font color="#E5E5E5"> address spoof to</font>

451
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:14,579
email other people it's basically what

452
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:17,369
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying here is it's easy to collect</font>

453

455
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:27,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">or 40 not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sync hold like 100 so when you</font>

456
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,790
register a domain you've got to use an

457
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,960
email<font color="#E5E5E5"> address right so basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

458
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,510
of all the locations on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

459
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">weathers email addresses forums I mean</font>

460
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:39,120
who is your organization's website

461
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:40,800
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole point is it's easy</font>

462
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,969
to collect email addresses but now

463
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,490
you've got email address what do you do

464
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:47,490
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it how many people know what a</font>

465
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:49,650
fishing kit is<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

466
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,929
like this from a technical standpoint

467
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,730
it's easy to make fishing kit<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

468
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:55,830
you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your target website you do</font>

469
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,570
file save as and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you take</font>

470
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,280
all the assets with you right and

471
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:01,950
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you've done is you've</font>

472
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,590
saved an HTML page that looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

473
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,030
son now there's two parts of a fishing

474
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,559
kit there's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> called a scam site</font>

475
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,850
which targets the brand and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're</font>

476
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,770
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scam there's something called</font>

477
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,809
a mailer which you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use to do</font>

478
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:16,350
what up mail things because it's called

479
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:18,660
mailer so once you get that site created

480
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,770
which looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like your target brand then</font>

481
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,420
what you're going to need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is you</font>

482
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,160
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to post it somewhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right you're</font>

483
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to put it up online somewhere and</font>

484
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:30,240
largely when you put it online you have

485
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:32,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of two options z the illegal option</font>

486
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,400
and the slightly less legal option right

487
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,919
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you're going to compromise</font>

488
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,500
probably some type of content management

489
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,590
system maybe WordPress because WordPress

490
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,120
is highly highly highly vulnerable is

491
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,669
there anybody here works your WordPress

492
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,199
okay good we're good we're good so

493
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,730
WordPress it's got a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

494
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,230
vulnerabilities we see it being hacked

495
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,760
almost every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact a lot of</font>

496
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,350
content management systems have boner

497
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,840
ability as you see it once they become

498
00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:00,090
compromised then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> upload stuff to</font>

499
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,770
that website right so you're basically

500
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:04,649
putting content on a website that

501
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,940
doesn't belong to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you or if you don't go</font>

502
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,920
that route there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

503
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,750
bulletproof hosting right you just buy

504
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,640
it probably buy it with stolen money and

505
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,860
you know what it's bulletproof so why

506
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">not use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it right so if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font>

507
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,639
go through that<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole process then you</font>

508
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,389
go get that once you get it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

509
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,200
running then

510
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,940
and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to use this</font>

511
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,890
mailer<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and basically the</font>

512
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,560
mailer is a web form probably written in

513
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:28,230
PHP maybe ASP or some like crazy

514
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,960
language like you know python or

515
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,880
something go maybe but basically its

516
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,590
interface it allows you to create a

517
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,260
message and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole point of this</font>

518
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:40,949
message is to try to social engineer

519
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:45,450
users back to your scanned page right so

520
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:46,740
whenever I use this mailer I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

521
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,320
send this email out to all the

522
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">collective email addresses now you're</font>

523
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,700
probably thinking well how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going</font>

524
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,730
to route it right how you gonna send all

525
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,770
this email traffic so the going rate for

526
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:02,430
a compromise email server right now is

527
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:04,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">about four dollars it's unfortunate it</font>

528
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:07,650
is true but for four dollars you can get

529
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,000
some smtp popped and you can just push

530
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,860
your mail through at your heart's

531
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,630
content and once that gets blacklisted

532
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,790
you buy another one for four dollars and

533
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,800
here's the sad reality though is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

534
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:19,889
send out tens of thousands of messages

535
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,560
all I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one person to fall for my</font>

536
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:25,860
scam and my smtp server has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> paid</font>

537
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,909
for think about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> four dollars think</font>

538
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,189
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much money I can drain your</font>

539
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:34,800
bank account of I mean it's not it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

540
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:36,810
it's easy math so we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

541
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,180
fishing is I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to tell</font>

542
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:42,780
you I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use paypal because</font>

543
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:44,370

544
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,500
you guys seen an email<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this before</font>

546
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,030

background is once you put your

Nation I'm going to reuse it over and

568
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:43,120
over and over again easy stuff right so

569
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:45,309
mmm in addition to<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromise and</font>

570
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,679
websites there's also this other thing

571
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:51,850
right that's in that scam site and it's

572
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:53,950
called a web shell basically what we see

573
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:58,149
a lot of these scam sites is that once

574
00:21:53,950 --> 00:22:00,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">we identify excuse me once a attacker is</font>

575
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,260
compromised<font color="#CCCCCC"> a website they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

576
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,820
have to re<font color="#CCCCCC"> compromise it over and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

577
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:06,100
and over again<font color="#E5E5E5"> they just want easy</font>

578
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,750
access so a lot of the times with these

579
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,050
scam kits will see something called web

580
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:14,020
shell that exists and the web shell is a

581
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:16,389
URL address accessible to the machine

582
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:18,400
it's basically a large PHP script that

583
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:20,920
gives them full access to the server and

584
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,750
I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about command line access to</font>

585
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,300
everything outside the webroot it's

586
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:27,370
basically a web interface to the

587
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,379
compromise machine and if they're

588
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,780
storing credentials locally this gives

589
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:33,730
them a vehicle to download<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

590
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:37,090
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that web server and we see these</font>

591
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:39,400
web shells a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

592
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:41,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking to yourself man I want to do</font>

593
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,800
this scam it sounds easy right well I'm

594
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,150
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you how so how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

595
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,678
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the majority of fish and kids</font>

596
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,880
come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dark market well how many</font>

597
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,800
people here<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the dark markets</font>

598
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,830
are everybody you read about them<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

599
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,510
news but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Got News for You majority of</font>

600
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:57,129
fishing doesn't actually occur in the

601
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:59,020
dark market in fact there's some

602
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:01,059
percentages of that curve in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dark</font>

603
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,650
market and it's true you could go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

604
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:05,260
dark market and you can make purchases

605
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,480
and buy these fishing kids but here's

606
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:10,750
the thing is the dark market has a large

607
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,910
barrier to entry right so the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

608
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,559
people who actually shop or the number

609
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">of people who go to the dark market is</font>

610
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,920
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> small and the number of those</font>

611
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,350
people who actually shop in the dark

612
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,730
market is really really really small<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

613
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:24,850
if you're selling a fish get in the dark

614
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:27,250
market then your core your core target

615
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,270
audience is like this big right and you

616
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,340
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want that you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make money</font>

617
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:32,290
so why put in the dark market especially

618
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,540
if these fishing kids on average only go

619
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,770
for like 12 fifty dollars if you only

620
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,090
sell three of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you made like a</font>

621
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:40,629
hundred dollars it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of money</font>

622
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:43,510
right I mean so what we're actually

623
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:45,450
seeing is that we see more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more</font>

624
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:47,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">these scams being distributed via</font>

625
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:51,600
social media right you guys familiar

626
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:54,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter github facebook facebook</font>

627
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,240
you know it's a beautiful platform for

628
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:59,250
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution of information so what</font>

629
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,039
we see is we see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of these guys</font>

630
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:04,110
hosting Facebook sites or other social

631
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:06,600
media sites which basically described

632
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:09,029
the phishing scam and give you

633
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,769
everything that you need to actually use

634
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:13,380
this information in the phishing scam

635
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:15,330
and you know what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> target audience is</font>

636
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,700
a lot larger<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the barrier to</font>

637
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,439
entry in facebook is a lot different

638
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,059
than the barrier to entry in the dark

639
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,309
market in fact if you look at these

640
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:26,789
three sites here what you'll notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

641
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:28,970
that the numbers equal 45,000 plus

642
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:31,559
people and this is only<font color="#E5E5E5"> three out of</font>

643
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:33,019
thousands of web pages and here's the

644
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,309
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about these social media sites</font>

645
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:37,110
tells you how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it gives you the</font>

646
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:38,820
files even gives you email addresses

647
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:41,189
tells you how to compromise servers in

648
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:44,010
fact more and more what we're seeing is

649
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:46,380
we're seeing things like all these

650
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:48,870
Facebook hosted sites telling you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

651
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">use these scam pages telling you how to</font>

652
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:52,739
compromise and collect these credentials

653
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,779
telling you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell these</font>

654
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:58,080
credentials and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we're seeing more</font>

655
00:24:54,779 --> 00:25:00,059
and more instruction and here's the big

656
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,010
payoff right instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of just like</font>

657
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:03,809
posting these things out there and

658
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,820
letting you figure it out they've got

659

660
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,779
hosted on YouTube<font color="#E5E5E5"> right in fact you</font>

661
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:11,639
could go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to youtube right down learn how</font>

hack I mean there's all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

665
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:19,740
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there that are done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sense of</font>

stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> utilize and they also</font>

672
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:34,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">scan you're probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering how do</font>

673
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,360
they benefit what's the benefit from<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

674
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,710
this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm going to talk about this</font>

675
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,789
in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit detail because I'm get a</font>

676
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,309
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

677
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:45,419
technical what I start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

678
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:48,600
fishing kids whenever they do this they

679
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:51,480
largely embed deep with inside the code

680
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:54,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fishing kit a backdoor and so</font>

681
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,919
they're relying on the fact that every

682
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,090
one of the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who redeploy their</font>

683
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,220
fishing kit and use it that

684
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:02,470
that that back door essentially will

685
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tech will take the credentials that are</font>

686
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:07,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">collected and also send it to the author</font>

687
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:08,918
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I write a fishing kit and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

688
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,539
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it they're pretty much my</font>

689
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:13,179
army for collection and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

690
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:15,158
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but those account credentials are</font>

691
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:16,240
being shipped<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me as well and I'm</font>

692
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:18,190
going to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that they're</font>

693
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,470
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me as my army and I'm going to</font>

694
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:22,419
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> box it up and amna sell it</font>

695
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,279
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to use it and that's how</font>

696
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:25,690
they're getting that's how they're

697
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:27,220
getting all the account credentials they

698
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,260
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even deploy these fish kids</font>

699
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,690
anymore they just rely on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> young</font>

700
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,799
people who want to do this stuff as the

701
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:36,340
individuals<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are going out and</font>

702
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,679
compromise the credentials for that so

703
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:42,908
you're thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this man how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

704
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:45,299
we combat this problem right and so one

705
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:50,110
of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've focused on is</font>

706
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:53,679
this ideology of incident centric<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus</font>

707
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:55,029
actor centric investigation<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so how</font>

708
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,179
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people here working Incident</font>

709
00:26:55,029 --> 00:27:00,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">Response</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> socks anything like that so</font>

710
00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:02,500
incident response is pretty much a

711
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:05,980
reaction right in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact the cyber kill</font>

712
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,539
chain is a reactionary point so

713
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,460
basically something<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens then we do</font>

714
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:12,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that is a reactionary stance</font>

715
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,960
and what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is we want to be</font>

716
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:16,720
proactive<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and it takes a mindset</font>

717
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,270
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's saying basically instead of</font>

718
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting with the incident let's start</font>

719
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,929
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> after the actors who are</font>

720
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:24,669
responsible for a lot of this crime all

721
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:26,500
right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> instead of working from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

722
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:28,720
ground up you work from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> top down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

723
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,980
if you start managing monitoring these

724
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,679
individuals who are putting this out

725
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,870
there then we can disrupt essentially

726
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:36,760
their economies and that's what we're

727
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:39,570
trying to do fishlabs is disrupt their

728
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:42,399
economies and let me give an example I

729
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:44,080
like threat actors I follow threat

730
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,330
actors almost every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got a lot</font>

731
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,889
of Investigation experience so it's easy

732
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:50,678
for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to track these guys down but</font>

733
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:52,630
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook so it's</font>

734
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:54,940
easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> track them down anyway and i</font>

735
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:57,399
gotta<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you fishers have the worst</font>

736
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,529
operational security<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean they're the</font>

737
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:02,678
worst online and most cyber criminals

738
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:05,320
are I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a joke that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've told</font>

739
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:07,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the floor it's like do you I mean it's</font>

740
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:10,168
it's crazy stupid how how done some

741
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:12,179
cyber criminals are but

742
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:13,739
let's talk about this guy so I'm gonna

743
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:16,109
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this one individual that we</font>

744
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:19,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">track right and he's a pretty prolific</font>

745
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:21,749
fish kid author he does stupid things

746
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:26,100
and think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a forensic</font>

747
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:28,049
stand put right so in his kids he has

748
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">all these characteristics which are we</font>

749
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:32,850
utilized to tie his activities together

750
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:35,159
such as renaming the infrastructures

751
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:37,799
with special characters or special

752
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:39,690
folder names such as going through and

753
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:42,179
renaming the files with special file

754
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:43,919
names which makes me which makes you an

755
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:46,440
easy which makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easy for me to</font>

756
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,269
identify his kit more importantly and a

757
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,609
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know this that hackers</font>

758
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:52,320
like to tag within their source code but

759
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:54,689
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that pretty much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

760
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,340

then now I've got the signature that I

763
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:02,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">can track you with it's easy to do this</font>

764
00:29:00,749 --> 00:29:05,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of stuff because I mean they do</font>

765
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:08,340
that they make it so blatantly obvious

766
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:10,019
more important this guy he has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

778
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,730
here's my stuff it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty badass</font>

779
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,470
here's who i'm targeting you go

780
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:39,570
compromise this site and when you

781
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,519
compromise the site here's how you use

782
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,989
the kit that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that's all you got to</font>

783
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:44,759
do and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wait for all those</font>

784
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:46,379
account credentials to come in and then

785
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:49,739
when you get him you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where to sell</font>

786
00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:53,549
them right and so he does all this but

787
00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:55,499
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> for him like I said he's</font>

788
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:57,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">got really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad hop sack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and how hard</font>

789
00:29:55,499 --> 00:30:00,419
truly is it to track individuals like

790
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:02,850
this let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at this guy so</font>

791
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:05,249
he's got you tube sites every site that

792
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:07,590
we go on Facebook YouTube social media

793
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:09,480
Twitter github these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these are</font>

794
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:12,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">all characteristics of a tracking right</font>

795
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,859
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this individual here he has a</font>

796
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:16,019
username when he posts these<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube</font>

797
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:17,820
videos you go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> his facebook site</font>

798
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:19,769
you look at all the activity same

799
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,960
individuals we see the names we pull the

800
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:22,600
names out and what we find is one of

801
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,850
those

802
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:28,059
is this hacking profile<font color="#CCCCCC"> which was not</font>

803
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:30,070
too clever and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he's got bad</font>

804
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:33,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">OPSEC he also blogs in with his true</font>

805
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:34,899
identity right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it let me give you a</font>

806
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,280
key if you're going to do hacking

807
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,970
campaign don't go there with your true

808
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:41,289
identity right so once we see this we

809
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,990
can start tracking all this stuff

810
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:47,110
together we say hey we think we know who

811
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:49,929
he is in fact thank you facebook we know

812

822
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,559

away and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what i mean by actor</font>

825
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:16,929
sent eccentric tracking we know what

826
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,120
he's doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know there will be</font>

827
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:20,890
incidents will manage this instance but

828
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the same time we want to focus on the</font>

829
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:25,539
actors right we want to take out their

830
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:32,860
infrastructures to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a huge impact</font>

831
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:35,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the cybercrime economies so fish</font>

832
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:37,240
kits are pretty advanced and if you

833
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:38,918
don't have you've never seen a fish kit

834
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,900
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to give you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font>

835
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:48,760
details on how they operate from a

836
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:50,710
technical standpoint so most fish kits

837
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,840
use email that's not a line I mean it's

838
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">just in there in fact most biscuits are</font>

839
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,590
written in PHP because PHP is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> free</font>

840
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:58,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">processing language</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but we see a little</font>

841
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:01,240
bit nowadays of some fish kits being

842
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:02,950
written in asp why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

843
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:07,000
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was dead language but hey</font>

844
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:09,340
whatever so mostly PHP right so what

845
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,789
you'll see here is in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> PHP basically</font>

846
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:14,980
this is a the information that you're

00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,030
that the trying to scam you can see here

849
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:21,610
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's got information like the</font>

username password token you know maybe

851
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:26,439
some geographic information where they

852
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:29,408
came from refers whatever and they use

853
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:33,490
email as a vehicle to collect the

854
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:35,830
account credentials however we take

855
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:37,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">those down at fishlabs we work on</font>

856
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:39,399
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the mule accounts right so</font>

857
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:40,870
let's say for example you keep on

858
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:42,129
creating your Moodle account so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

859
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:43,959
on taking them down they get frustrated

860
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:45,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so what we've seen is we've seen</font>

861
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,230
this little shift in the way that they

862
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:49,029
collect<font color="#CCCCCC"> these account credentials we've</font>

863
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:51,640
seen it move from traditional email

864
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:54,070
communication to other tactics such as

865
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,600
this pretty much which is storing the

866
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:57,399
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> directly on the compromised</font>

867
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,230
server remember I<font color="#CCCCCC"> told you earlier that</font>

868
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:00,969
they push these things called the web

869
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:03,100
shell directly into the compromised site

870
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,600
they can go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> later on and use the</font>

871
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:09,100
web shell to collect all the compromise

872
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:12,039
credits or what we've also seen is we've

873
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:15,039
seen posts to your elves so now they're

874
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:16,720
using refer logs right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what</font>

875
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,039
they're saying is hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to take</font>

876
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,630
all the count credentials I'm going to

877
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:21,669
drop it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the URL and then I'm</font>

878
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:24,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">elected</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the referrer log from</font>

879
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:26,769
wherever whatever website I have access

880
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> refer logs so I mean it's easy to do</font>

881
00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:31,750
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's ? and then whatever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

882
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:34,658
after ? right inside report inside port

883
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:36,519
80 the other thing we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen is we've</font>

884
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:39,250
seen this weird shift we've seen this

885
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:42,070
weird shift using IRC channels jabber

886
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:44,139
based communication so now whenever you

887
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:46,779
whenever it collects that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cal credential</font>

888
00:33:44,139 --> 00:33:48,279
they're popping up a jabber message so

889
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:50,110
they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some IRC server somewhere</font>

890
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:52,210
we're basically there every time they're

891
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:53,350
collecting cred there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> message pops</font>

892
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:55,899
out with that credential information

893
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:57,820
right which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of ingenious I mean</font>

894
00:33:55,899 --> 00:33:59,139
except that if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else gets usually</font>

895
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,700
and password<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can jump on there and</font>

896
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:05,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">collect them as well maybe even you know</font>

897
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:09,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">change the password I'm just saying so</font>

898
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,989
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking oh these HTML pages like</font>

899
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:12,520
they're not really complemented

900
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:14,918
complicated but I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

901
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,139
they're extremely complicated with a lot

902
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:19,388
of conditional logic in fact if you look

903
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:22,929
at this one right if you look at this

904
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:26,500
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes into protecting</font>

905
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:29,200
the infrastructure for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example if</font>

906
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,690
they're spearfishing some<font color="#E5E5E5"> users that</font>

907
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,060
work a specific company then one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

908
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:37,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that they might do is just only</font>

909
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:39,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">allow access from those IPS that come</font>

910
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:42,040
from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> company footprint right this</font>

911
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:44,649
is quite literally the definition of

912
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:47,090
conditional logic is basically saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

913
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:49,190
this IP is one that I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

914
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:52,330
did and collecting information from give

915
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:55,940
it access otherwise send it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google or</font>

916
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:59,120
Disney or Microsoft or wherever or maybe

917
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:00,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">even just give it back a 403</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make maybe</font>

918
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the user doesn't even know it exists</font>

919
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:04,580
this is essentially called<font color="#E5E5E5"> geographic</font>

920
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:08,020
targeting and it's a problem right

921
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:10,490
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if these kids have all this</font>

922
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:13,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">Geographic targeting logic built into</font>

923
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:15,890
them and we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's a</font>

924
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:17,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">Spanish bass fishing kit then why do</font>

925
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:19,879
English speaking countries need to

926
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:24,589
access it if the targets are all located

927
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:26,240
in South America so other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

928
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:29,090
conditional logic they still use a lot

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">of HT access files right and I love</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> HT</font>

930
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:33,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">access files because it gives me a ton</font>

931
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:36,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">of intelligence information it gives me</font>

932
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:38,180
information not only about the target

933
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:41,029
but it gives me information about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

934
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:43,609
who the target has<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen before right if</font>

935
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:46,040
you scroll through these<font color="#E5E5E5"> HT access files</font>

936
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:47,420
has all this commenting in there right I

937
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,460
love the ones where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep their</font>

938
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:51,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're tracking the silence guys who</font>

939
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:53,240
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracking them right look at it so</font>

940
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,770
the criminals are tracking the guys who

941
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">are tracking them and that's ingenious</font>

942
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:59,810
right that basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> says oh these</font>

943
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:01,910
criminals are aware that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

944
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:07,009
targeted by these security researchers

945
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:09,290
at this company so one of the things

946
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:11,300
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> try to identify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fish kids</font>

947
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:13,730
that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosted online is look at a lot</font>

948
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:15,500
at refer logs right in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> we asked our</font>

949
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:19,160
clients to give us their refer logs and

950
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:22,190
what the referrer log has is it has a

951
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,580
request<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a corporate asset which</font>

952
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:27,890
usually should come from corporate URL

953
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:31,340
however if you see for example logo got

954
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:32,569
gif being a sec accessed from cheese com

955
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,490
then you're probably thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

956
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:36,500
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> why is my logo being accessed</font>

957
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:40,520
from this website right and this is

958
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:42,860
called refer detection however what

959
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,380
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of lately is that</font>

960
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:48,290
instead of accessing these globally

961
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:50,360
accessible assets inside of HTML pages

962
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,880
we've seen logic being built directly

963
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:55,820
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kit to evade all that right</font>

964
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,070
either they'll drop the individual

965
00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:00,040
assets locally into this camp kit or

966
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:03,490
what we've seen is they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

967
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:07,029
bed that information directly<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

968
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:09,040
PHP so encode base64 drop the gift

969
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:11,170
directly into the code now they don't

970
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,420
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with it local asset during</font>

971
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:16,240
the interpretation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the PHP page it's</font>

972
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:18,820
loading it's faster there's no global

973
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,250
access to any assets it's self-contained

974
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:23,080
no referral logs so we've seen this

975
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:27,610
being used over and over and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

976
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:31,330
now it's not it's also not that simple

977
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:34,480
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people delve in occupation and</font>

978
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:36,880
encryption I do I love me some

979
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,120
encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so you should</font>

980
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,010
encrypt everything and what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing</font>

981
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,350
is we're seeing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of these authors</font>

982
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:46,060
do that right so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through</font>

983
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:48,160
and they're encrypting encrypting and

984
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,600
crypt encrypting right so I just talk to

985
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,910
you a minute ago about back doors and

986
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm gonna give you an example so when</font>

987
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:56,410
one of these threat actors actually puts

988
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:58,000
out this fishing kit right they're going

989
00:37:56,410 --> 00:38:00,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to leave the fish kit in plain view</font>

990
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,020
because they want the<font color="#CCCCCC"> person who's going</font>

991
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:04,390
to deploy it to modify it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet their</font>

992
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:06,820
needs however don't forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they put</font>

993
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:09,220
a back door in the kit right and the

994
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,530
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of the back door is embedded</font>

995
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,270
as deep as possible so they never<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

996
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:15,850
it and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about this</font>

997
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:18,009
additional communication channel so if

998
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:19,900
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at this kit we do code</font>

999
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:22,180
inspection what you'll immediately

1000
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:24,580
notice is that there's an F right right

1001
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,899
and PHP which is like it include right

1002
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:28,720
so you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at it and you're</font>

1003
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:30,660
saying hey what's that including and

1004
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,890
when you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the file</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that includes</font>

1005
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,899
that looks familiar right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that looks</font>

1006
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:38,740
like a jquery library but think yourself

1007
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:41,530
why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use PHP to include the jQuery</font>

1008
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:43,390
library when I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just include it with</font>

1009
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:45,820
a script tag with all the other script

1010
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:47,290
tags so you kind of get interested or if

1011
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,240
you're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security researcher you get</font>

1012
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:51,370
interested you want to dig in so you

1013
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,709
start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this and then all the</font>

1014
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:57,250
way at the bottom there's another

1015
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:59,590
include inside of this so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically this</font>

1016
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:02,680
files including another file and guess

1017
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:04,870
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that file is off you skated right</font>

1018
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,549
in fact I look at it and I'm like oh

1019
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,930
look at all that beautiful code it's

1020
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:10,600
going to take me forever to look at that

1021
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:11,419
but once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do it once you d obfuscated</font>

1022
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,950
that weather

1023
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,920
you do it with some type of deification

1024
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:18,200
tool or you manually do it then you're

1025
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,480
going to find this embedded code and

1026
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,069
what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing is we're seeing that</font>

1027
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,630
this embedded back to our code is

1028
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:25,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially collecting the same</font>

1029
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:27,380
information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other users are</font>

1030
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:29,899
collecting so there's a whole other

1031
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:34,819
communication channel that exists inside

1032
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:37,069
of this code oops so now think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1033
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:38,839
I write a kit I get people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deploy my</font>

1034
00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:40,940
kid I hope that thousands of people

1035
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:42,319
deploy my kit and now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an army of</font>

1036
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,690
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploying my kit who are</font>

1037
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:46,250
collecting credentials for me right I

1038
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:49,089
don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to collect credentials</font>

1039
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:51,470
creating a fish kid is not illegal

1040
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:53,000
that's like crazy malware is not illegal

1041
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:54,618
like you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> used as long as you</font>

1042
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,119
don't use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right so if you create it</font>

1043
00:39:54,619 --> 00:40:01,309
and you don't use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not legal so</font>

1044
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's not the only way in fact what</font>

1045
00:40:01,309 --> 00:40:05,390
we've seen is we've seen a lot of

1046
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:07,069
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> occupation methods inside all</font>

1047
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:09,558
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids and I'm going to refer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1048
00:40:07,069 --> 00:40:11,270
this one because essentially when I was

1049
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:12,710
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of malware stuff there's</font>

1050
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:14,210
something exists called a file type

1051
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,400
mismatch and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you probably know</font>

1052
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:20,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it it's basically whether the file</font>

1053
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,220
is like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know malware TMP and instead</font>

1054
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:24,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a TMP file it's like an exe file</font>

1055
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:26,089
because the file signature shows it at

1056
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:28,180
sappi instead of it being a TMP and

1057
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:29,960
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an example no</font>

1058
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:32,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">self-respecting malware authors going to</font>

1059
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:37,040
name their malware<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bauer also just</font>

1060
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:39,230
saying that so let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this you</font>

1061
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,630
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right this includes a PNG file</font>

1062
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:44,420
however when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at the actual file</font>

1063
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:47,960
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a PNG file right it's not a</font>

1064
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:50,119
graphics file it's a PHP file so once

1065
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,890
it's included with PHP we include then

1066
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:53,660
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible it's interpretive all</font>

1067
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:55,279
right and so we go through the same

1068
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,930
methodology well actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one's</font>

1069
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,240
created by free online tool so we know

1070
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:00,859
we can do if you skate it quickly so use

1071
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,098
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> d off you skate it and what</font>

1072
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:06,920
we find<font color="#E5E5E5"> is another level of optimization</font>

1073
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:11,329
right how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> here know what</font>

1074
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:14,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">Packers are Maori Packers okay so just</font>

1075
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:17,869
like with malware<font color="#E5E5E5"> Packers there is no</font>

1076
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:19,910
rules on the level of encryption and

1077
00:41:17,869 --> 00:41:21,799
obfuscation you can put it in place all

1078
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,580
right you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> pack a file with a packer</font>

1079
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:25,220
with another pack

1080
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:27,790
with another<font color="#CCCCCC"> Packer at some point you're</font>

1081
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:30,200
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be limited</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by execution time</font>

1082
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:31,640
same thing goes with fish kit you can

1083
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,140
obvious get a fish kit and then re off

1084
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,790
you hit it again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rioc your skin</font>

1085
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,230
it again use multiple off you station

1086
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:37,940
methods we just multiple decryption

1087
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:39,290
methods it doesn't matter you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go</font>

1088
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,570
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could go through and do</font>

1089
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:43,250
file renaming of all your assets within

1090
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:45,470
your code so that you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1091
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,150
gobbledygook<font color="#E5E5E5"> Campbell back like naming</font>

1092
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,740
convention no one knows exactly what

1093
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:51,500
your variables are doing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do</font>

1094
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:53,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">all that because in the end it's all</font>

1095
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,090
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be interpreted by the computer</font>

1096
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:58,790
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's supposed to be machine readable</font>

1097
00:41:55,090 --> 00:42:00,110
all right once we do you skate this then

1098
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:01,430
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find that back door we're</font>

1099
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to see it it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be there</font>

1100
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:07,819
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be available for you right</font>

1101
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:10,370
so in this instance specifically we see

1102
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:12,290
this backdoor actually sending more

1103
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:17,060
information to some credential account

1104
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:19,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone that's not the only vehicle to</font>

1105
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,600
obfuscate information right how many

1106
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:24,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">people play around with gif images</font>

1107
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:26,630
anybody access information you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1108
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,069
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys know about gif exploits so</font>

1109
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:30,080
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge gif exploit out there</font>

1110
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:31,970
right now so basically the gift exploit

1111
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,279
is anything after the file signature can

1112
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:35,689
be executed<font color="#CCCCCC"> largely and what we're</font>

1113
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">seeing is we're seeing a lot of what</font>

1114
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:39,050
those those web shells that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked</font>

1115
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:42,200
about earlier being embedded directly

1116
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:44,510
into gif files so these gif files if you

1117
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,810
look at it has a legitimate signature

1118
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:49,940
meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's got a dot gif</font>

1119
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:52,460
extension right it's legitimately a gif

1120
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:55,160
file however after that file signature

1121
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:57,530
we see PHP code embedded directly into

1122
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:59,629
the file right and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the times</font>

1123
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:03,020
what we're seeing this done for is to

1124
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:05,480
hide the web shell directly in the site

1125
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:07,759
outside of this is the system

1126
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,980
administrator view so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a system</font>

1127
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,690
administrator I look at a file dot gif

1128
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,860
file signature looks the same good

1129
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:15,530
that's an image I don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry</font>

1130
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:19,070
about it but if I access this on a page

1131
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:21,380
on a lamp stack via this URL it's going

1132
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:24,050
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> interpret this PHP code and it's</font>

1133
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:27,530
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to serve back this Web shell to me</font>

1134
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:29,360
which gives me access to the box so this

1136
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:35,680
mean i love<font color="#E5E5E5"> the level of obfuscation and</font>

1137
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:37,420
that the attackers actually used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1138
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,290
hide their activities I mean this is

1139
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:44,200
stuff that really interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me so</font>

1140
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:47,980
my whole point here is that fishing

1141
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:52,210
largely is a what a lot of people think

1142
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:54,010
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower level crime is I think a lot</font>

1144
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:59,710
is considering<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that ninety</font>

1145
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,510
percent of most malware infections start

1146
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:04,960
with fishing campaigns just like this

1147
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:08,859
and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard essentially to get to</font>

training people to understand what this

00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:49,119
attack scenario it looks like and how

1166
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:50,200
serious it is right without<font color="#E5E5E5"> spam ninety</font>

00:44:51,849 --> 00:44:58,990
and love and look at won't exist right

1170
00:44:54,849 --> 00:45:02,500
not only that but spam phishing as a

1171
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:04,299
entry into the threat campaign is

1172
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,799
becoming more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more fans it's</font>

1173
00:45:04,299 --> 00:45:09,609
becoming harder and harder to identify

1174
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:12,040
and attack and look at all the

1175
00:45:09,609 --> 00:45:14,890
information that's actually going on so

1176

whole point here is to impact the

1187
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:38,859
economies of cybercrime by taking out

1188
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:41,558
the infrastructures and the actors who

1189
00:45:38,859 --> 00:45:44,170
are largely responsible for focusing for

1190
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:46,089
causing all of this damage right so with

1191
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:47,650
