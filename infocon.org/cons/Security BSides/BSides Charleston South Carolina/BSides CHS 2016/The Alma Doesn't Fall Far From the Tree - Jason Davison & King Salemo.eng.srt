1
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:24,740
alright so our present I should our

2
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,419
presentations on a little bit of

3
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,040
overview of ransomware first we're going

4
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,500
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of then talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a piece of</font>

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,730
ransomware that we found via social

7
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:40,390
media monitoring type of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

8
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:42,890
back in late<font color="#E5E5E5"> August and we were able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

9
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,840
basically perform a man-in-the-middle

10
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,890
attack on the ransomware and intercept

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,329
the key going across and essentially

12
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,620
decrypt files without having to pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

13
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:54,650
ransom so we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that in the</font>

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,209
second half for the talk so like I just

15
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,470
said we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of go over the</font>

16
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,489
state of ransomware we're going to talk

17
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:03,860
about its profitability what makes it

18
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:07,490
simple in comparison to banking Trojans

19
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:10,399
really the type of one size fits all

20
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,110
thing and then we'll move into

21
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:15,170
ransomware like I said we'll give you

22
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:18,440
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a rundown of network</font>

23
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,479
activity encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> decryption and then</font>

24
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,670
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we carried out the man in the middle</font>

25
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,549
attack and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrap it up and then</font>

26
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:32,420
happily take any questions that anyone

27
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:34,729
has first an introduction who are we my

28
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:39,799
name is Jason Davidson and this is King

29
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:42,229
suhlemah we work at fishlabs and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

30
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">play with malware on a regular basis</font>

31
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:49,850
yeah anything the head yeah no I just

32
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:55,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when I am I'm definitely in</font>

33
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:56,750
the orange suit I got warrants ooh so

34
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,280
ransomware the current ransomware

35
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:02,060
pandemic so why is racing where become

36
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:05,659
so popular in 2016 that's really become

37
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:08,179
the the malware of choice amongst

38
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:10,729
cybercriminals if you will in the end

39
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:11,930
like cyber criminals are just

40
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,299
businessman right there<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to make</font>

41
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:18,410
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they want to make money as</font>

42
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:20,959
efficiently as possible meaning less

43
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,420
work on their end while still returning

44
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,560
a decent profit<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them how can they</font>

45
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,920
gain the most money in the shortest

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,510
amount of time if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

47
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,179
so that goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> along</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the first point</font>

48
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,739
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> ransomware is profitable it's also</font>

49
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,260
relatively simple in comparison to

50
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:37,180
banking trojan what kind of banking

51
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:41,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">Trojans we'll talk about that a little</font>

52
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit later less moving parts just less</font>

53
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,569
less movement of money really<font color="#E5E5E5"> overall</font>

54
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:52,090
you can make use of bitcoins and

55
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:54,160
anonymity in bitcoins in Bitcoin wallets

56
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:58,390
so that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes kind of</font>

57
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:03,280
ransomware more simplistic in the sense

58
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:06,160
of getting paid and making money one

59
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,920
size fits all right so you really just

60
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to once you get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your encryption</font>

61
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,619
right and you have a semi robust

62
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,269
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just kinda you can</font>

63
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,959
kind of tweak your payloads here and

64
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:21,610
there to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work on like</font>

65
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:23,890
detection and mitigating detection and

66
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,910
things like that to make a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

67
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:29,649
more successful but once ransomware runs

68
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,970
you've already<font color="#E5E5E5"> your are you already</font>

69
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,530
successful right you've encrypted their

70
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,459
files and then it's either they're going

71
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:38,200
to pay or they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pay so</font>

72
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:41,410
with banking<font color="#E5E5E5"> trojans in comparison here</font>

73
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,810
I think for track right you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

74
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,810
you have to the victim has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open the</font>

75
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:50,140
browser twice before wat<font color="#CCCCCC"> wreck will</font>

76
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,489
provide web ejects to when they navigate

77
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,470
to their banking website and things like

78
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:55,600
that there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just much more much more</font>

79
00:03:53,470 --> 00:04:00,340
moving parts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> things going on with</font>

80
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:03,160
banking<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojans so like I said bought</font>

81
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:06,690
wreck anything to add I'm banking charge

82
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:10,660
inside mm-hmm good to go everybody well

83
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:15,190
thanks but so I'm moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

84
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:16,478
profitability ransomware the FBI stated

85
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,450
the first three<font color="#E5E5E5"> months of 2016 the</font>

86
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:22,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">ransomware had a community 209 million</font>

87
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:25,900
dollars and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lockheed came around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> locky</font>

88
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,970
being the first really<font color="#CCCCCC"> major major</font>

89
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,638
change in campaign and kind of swing

90
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:33,070
things towards ransomware in 2016 it was

91
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,710
about mid-february februari 12th or 16th

92
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:40,330
somewhere around there was when<font color="#CCCCCC"> locky</font>

93
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,669
came out and like i like i said on the

94
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,950
second

95
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:46,820
point here major campaigns like<font color="#CCCCCC"> locky</font>

96
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:51,560
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> server are both successful based on</font>

97
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:53,510
spam volume alone now lucky as far as as

98
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,420
far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as far as nobody else is</font>

99
00:04:53,510 --> 00:05:00,770
alluded to<font color="#E5E5E5"> walkie being run by multiple</font>

100
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:04,430
groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> just by one group who spams out</font>

101
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:07,130
just loads and loads of samples via the

102
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,110
neck ears botnet and server is actually

103
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:12,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably the most successful ransomware</font>

104
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,780
as a service campaign where the original

105
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:20,750
authors will basically lend their code

106
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:22,159
base to people that want to give give<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

107
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:32,810
ransomware campaign or give a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ransomware</font>

108
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:35,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">run ago so overall profit each</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> locky or</font>

109
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:38,000
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lahti estimation was originally</font>

110
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:41,060
drafted a report provided by the telus

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,490
group and<font color="#E5E5E5"> april i believe this is just</font>

112
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,510
to give you an<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of the potential</font>

113
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:50,150
profit that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Milwaukee could be could be</font>

114
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:52,420
spinning off we could see here they did

115
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:54,620
two different calculations based on

116
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,900
whether victims were paying one Bitcoin

117
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:02,180
or whether victims were paying half a

118
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:04,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bitcoin and over 12 months you either</font>

119
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:09,230
make it if your if your victims per day

120
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:11,630
stay the same you're making 393 million

121
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,970
dollars or 196 million dollars

122
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:18,110
essentially which is a good chunk of

123
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:24,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">change and I I wish I made that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

124
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:24,790
money work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a year I'm good</font>

125
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:38,380
so here's an actual from check check why

126
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:41,560
put out a great a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> blog and a great</font>

127
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:44,500
white paper on insight into the server

128
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,530
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> server ring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of server group and this</font>

129
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:51,759
this image<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually from from one of</font>

130
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:54,039
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> blogs where they have where they</font>

131
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,289
are inside the server panel and you can

132
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:58,990
see actual actual infection numbers here

133
00:06:56,289 --> 00:07:00,930
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like this like hard numbers</font>

134
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:04,210
where the tallest group was estimating

135
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:06,370
based on payment and victims per day

136
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,710
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are hard numbers this is</font>

137
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:12,580
what the server<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server author the</font>

138
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:14,440
person on utilizing the the service at

139
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,719
the time these are this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what they're</font>

140
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:20,710
actually making so we can see installs

141
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,449
encryption started good encryption

142
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,359
started to have the encryption is

143
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:27,250
completed and then we can see before the

144
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,400
far right column we can see the number

145
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:32,979
of payments and we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a profit</font>

146
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,570
column on the very far right where it

147
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:38,139
shows exactly how much money they're

148
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:39,460
making so<font color="#E5E5E5"> overall they had 10,000 insult</font>

149
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:42,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't know how long this period is</font>

150
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:47,400
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like from april 9th to april 23rd</font>

151
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:50,800
so 10,000 installs with a profit of

152
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,299
fifty-three thousand dollars which over

153
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> course of two weeks is a good chunk</font>

154
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,250
of change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and these are these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i like</font>

155
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:00,099
this image because like I said they're

156
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:04,990
hard numbers so it gives you an idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

157
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:08,050
actually what they're making so right

158
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:12,479
ransomware makes use of operating system

159
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:14,590
features right it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they're</font>

160
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,359
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not doing they're not home</font>

161
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,758
brewing their own encryption or if they

162
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,800
are chances are it's probably capable of

163
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:22,330
being cracked or broken they make use of

164
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,130
operating sister the cryptic

165
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:30,330
cryptographic libraries within the

166
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:32,500
operating system which makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> for very</font>

167
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,640
simplistic right api called very

168
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,429
simplistic yeah and

169
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,140
easy easy uh he's got a lot of times

170
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:41,030
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see on the teeth on movies we</font>

171
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,049
see like these<font color="#E5E5E5"> mad hackers sitting on</font>

172
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,490
the keyboard making the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

173
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:46,219
sophisticated<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of malware you ever</font>

174
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,800
seen and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like uncrackable and they</font>

175
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:51,230
can't trace it or find anything real

176
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,900
life that never really happens and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

177
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:56,270
ransomware it's even less so the whole

178
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,880
point of blocky was to make the<font color="#E5E5E5"> payload</font>

179
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:02,240
as simple as possible so what they did

180
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,550
was they<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't do a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of anti vm sort</font>

181
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,030
of detection or anti analysis detections

182
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:10,219
the reason for that is the more anti

183
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:13,220
analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> intentions you put in the more</font>

184
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,890
likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> a likelihood a security products</font>

185
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,470
going to flag it so if they don't do any

186
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,240
any sort of checks at all then the

187
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,040
likelihood of it succeeding and

188
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,720
encrypting and perhaps scripting

189
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,689
encrypting things on shared drives and

190
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,370
stuff increases a lot and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't so</font>

191
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,780
they don't care if they're my vm or not

192
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,100
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are running stuff in</font>

193
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,959
virtualized environments so they just

194
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:36,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">care that it executes and it's encrypted</font>

195
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:39,800
yourself like hospitals<font color="#E5E5E5"> per se reason</font>

196
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:42,260
hospitals payout is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say you</font>

197
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,790
have a nightly backup right hospital has

198
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:47,180
a lot that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened since that nightly</font>

199
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:49,790
back up to say if it ran like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lunch</font>

200
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">time so you look at that amount of data</font>

201
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,120
within that time that's accumulated

202
00:09:51,040 --> 00:10:00,240
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason to hospitals can pay</font>

203
00:09:53,120 --> 00:10:02,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that kind of it ya llego</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> park</font>

204
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,529
but like the targets for those and he's

205
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,010
at a hospital<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can understand that is</font>

206
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:09,510
that like well I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> the large sums of</font>

207
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:11,790
majority like big industry like

208
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,270
impossible<font color="#CCCCCC"> o or like early base being it</font>

209
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:18,000
too or is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like was a baby</font>

210
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:20,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">um with so a lot of people get hit and</font>

211
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,940
the industry's very the ones that are

212
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually paying our people in hospitals</font>

213
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,720
so they have no other option right like

214
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,460
your hospital like your you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

215
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,500
your native a key target at all it's

216
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,760
just same their trees many people well

217
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,430
that's the thing right with ransomware

218
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,490
it's like the more targets you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

219
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:40,170
higher chance of making money where are

220
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:43,020
the emails are crafted in such a way

221
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:45,120
where sometimes they will send it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

222
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,290
hospitals looking like something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

223
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,410
the hospital would see on a day-to-day

224
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:51,930
basis so like it'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> some medical</font>

225
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:55,469
terminology for them to elicit user

226
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,660
interaction small<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sheriff's Office end</font>

227
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:00,330
up paying because I'm usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

228
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,680
their IT isn't up to snuff and they go

229
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,620
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look and they have like that</font>

230
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,750
goes for like a week ago so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

231
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:11,540
plenty of<font color="#E5E5E5"> small police offices that have</font>

232
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,540
paid out on of who else is paid

233
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:29,210
years to ethics why would they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

234
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:30,980
come so yeah so it depends on when the

235
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:34,160
ransomware runs and it depends on the

236
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,270
infrastructure there are certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

237
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,040
that you think would be streamlined

238
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:40,579
within a hospital on certain things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

239
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,130
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be configured in such a way that it</font>

240
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:46,730
was changed to accommodate some other

241
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:49,550
piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of software it really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> depends like</font>

242
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:52,040
big hospitals with bait out and it was

243
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:54,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was it was</font>

244
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,630
hospital to LA right<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah um tic got</font>

245
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,830
smacked by Lackey and I think they ended

246
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,250
up paying seventeen thousand dollars

247
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,940
total to get their files back yeah

248
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:05,140
that's definitely one of the most

249
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:07,820
notable<font color="#E5E5E5"> as far as targeting goes I</font>

250
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,410
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like some of the lures are</font>

251
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:13,040
crafted or<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the initial email at</font>

252
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:14,540
our likes sent out like so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you</font>

253
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,329
work at a hospital then like he said

254
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:20,780
medical terminology things like that

255
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:22,400
financial institutions invoice like

256
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,810
right invoices and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

257
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,430
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to look at my invoice or why</font>

258
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,780
am I have to pay this much money<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it</font>

259
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:31,939
like you're sending one to your bank

260
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:34,790
torrent<font color="#CCCCCC"> Locker used to be torrent lock</font>

261
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:37,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">that used to be the most targeted as far</font>

262
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:40,420
as geo regions go they would do some

263
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,530
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy like geoip blocking where</font>

264
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,969
you have to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that specific</font>

265
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:47,270
region and they would even block some

266
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:50,900
VPN notes if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wanted to like try to</font>

267
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:52,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the payload right so uh though</font>

268
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,290
that's probably the most targeted that

269
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've seen yeah I'm not familiar with</font>

270
00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:00,079
epic I'm not sure oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it's actually</font>

271
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:01,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">running so there's I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean within a</font>

272
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,480
hospital i know there's many different

273
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:05,330
segments you know the accounting group

274
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,790
may be running<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a different manner you</font>

275
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:10,640
know as opposed to the ER or other

276
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:14,540
segments so they take advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

277
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'd have to look more into epic</font>

278
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:23,620
actually

279
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:29,140
question actually yeah that is a great

280
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:31,420
question yeah um a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people so a</font>

281
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:34,960
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pay is consumers</font>

282
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:37,900
so that I think what we saw was like two

283
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:41,470
percent very very low Oh Yancy was like

284
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:43,000
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I def I have so many computers I</font>

285
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,610
mean I'm a little bit of a special case

286
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,470
but like I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe I have a linux</font>

287
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,180
distro right and I'm like oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> my god just</font>

288
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at it I'm like oh I don't really</font>

289
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,359
care about my files time to put a new

290
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,820
distro on I was like I like to change

291
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,830
distros all the time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes I'll</font>

292
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,300
back up sometimes I'm oh I like

293
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:01,060
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> just blowing away my files</font>

294
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,969
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean if he's only gonna help</font>

295
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:07,119
you so much I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you from personal</font>

296
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:08,350
experience a/v is really really bad I'd

297
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,110
say there's certain vendors that are

298
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:13,270
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than others I could recommend</font>

299
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:16,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">some I don't know if I allowed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

300
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:20,589
that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh i would say about three of</font>

301
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:22,390
them are better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than most and other than</font>

302
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:23,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">that like I don't even know how you most</font>

303
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,939
vectors are going to be through your

304
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,140
email right like they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

305
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:30,670
sent to you via email and I I can't put

306
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,520
myself in somebody else's mind set based

307
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:36,430
on the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know like I delete</font>

308
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,610
all my emails like barely read them and

309
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:42,010
I just never click on anything I don't

310
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,570
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if is and there's I can't</font>

311
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:47,529
speak for people<font color="#CCCCCC"> when they call my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dad</font>

312
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:50,170
yeah yeah so someone got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube video</font>

313
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:52,510
about getting hit with Iran sworn i was

314
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:54,250
saying that the the backup utility he

315
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:56,589
was using was impenetrable to the

316
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,330
ransomware that he that he got infected

317
00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:00,100
with it wasn't that it was an

318
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,839
impenetrable as a lot of the ransomware

319
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,089
that occurs is looking for certain

320
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,650
extensions so what happens is when his

321
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:07,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">file is being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> backed up it was some</font>

322
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,730
random extension for that particular

323
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,800
piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of software which is not going to</font>

324
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,750
be in the list of extensions that is

325
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking to encourage a lot of them is</font>

326
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,920
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cryptos dot exe dll because</font>

327
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,439
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to want to try to</font>

328
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,790
corrupt a file that's you know important

329
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,020
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the operating system so they're not</font>

330
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,649
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system down with</font>

331
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,100
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font>

332
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:29,920
the Manson so looking for doc xls

333
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,470
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for files that they know</font>

334
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,759
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have important data for you</font>

335
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,379
the usual a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them have a</font>

336
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,959
pre-loaded extension list and those are

337
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:39,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">the extensions are looking to encrypt so</font>

338
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:41,040
they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to mass blast and</font>

339
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,089
encrypt every single file on your system

340
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,050
because nine times out of ten if they do

341
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:45,850
that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to hit something</font>

342
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:48,490
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to run</font>

343
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:51,569
very well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't like the system</font>

344
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:55,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">files it so exactly the things that hold</font>

345
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:59,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">value right what took prices photos or</font>

346
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,029
like yeah so photos<font color="#CCCCCC"> Excel documents I</font>

347
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,649
mean head of accounting information well

348
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:04,749
they lost whitelist those directories

349
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:06,059
like the important system directories so

350
00:16:04,749 --> 00:16:07,899
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go through and do some</font>

351
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:09,550
executables like via games or something

352
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:11,170
they can hit those but then they'll make

353
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:14,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like they don't hit system 32</font>

354
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:16,569
and things like that right yeah we are

355
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:19,809
going on the file center thing like if I

356
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:22,300
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I to open and I saved my I the</font>

357
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:23,889
database file the ID because it's dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

358
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,628
<font color="#E5E5E5">DB is the extension that doesn't get</font>

359
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:27,490
encrypted because why would anybody have

360
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:32,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ida files on their computer that's</font>

361
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:35,769
getting encrypted by ransomware but i

362
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,300
would say depending on like because most

363
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:40,809
people to the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this is</font>

364
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of changing tides here i don't know</font>

365
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:44,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">how many of you do banking on your</font>

366
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,459
actual computer but a lot of like mobile

367
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,459
banking right that's becoming much

368
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:50,649
bigger and so also the mobile attack

369
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:54,579
vector is becoming more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more savory</font>

370
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:57,069
if you will whereas like I don't like I

371
00:16:54,579 --> 00:17:01,149
barely sign in to my banking website on

372
00:16:57,069 --> 00:17:03,009
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer to to do anything really</font>

373
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:04,539
like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't I don't use my computers</font>

374
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:11,279
for critical functions fairly I don't

375
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:11,279
know how do you live yeah I did barely

376
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:27,510
mobile browser user use desktop browser

377
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:36,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">keys Wow I appreciate you backing me up</font>

378
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:39,129
yes I'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna see a lot of this</font>

379
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:45,850
increase in the future towards things

380
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:52,600
like mobile devices are IOT devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

381
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:54,280
Dropbox it back to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ball this yeah so</font>

382
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,110
we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other day</font>

383
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,760
we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people have</font>

384
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,439
called services but people end up map

385
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,760
and drives for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer and some</font>

386
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,130
actually go out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> start encrypting</font>

387
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,690
stuff on shared drives depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how</font>

388
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,700
the clouds actually use<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was actually</font>

389
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:09,100
thinking about someone making you know

390
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,770
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even be like clever you could</font>

391
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">easily do it we're actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connected to</font>

392
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,980
some sort of cloud service<font color="#CCCCCC"> star Krypton</font>

393
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,810
so if you have one drive and they had

394
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">one drive on your computer which is like</font>

395
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,899
map to your phone right and then your TV

396
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,250
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if it was</font>

397
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:24,040
able to get up there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and even then</font>

398
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:29,440
propagate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those devices that</font>

399
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:35,379
would be nifty<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah right um but you</font>

400
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:40,810
have to be able to pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up that good</font>

401
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:42,690
yeah yeah so it's a sleep backups but

402
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:46,690
like most people aren't going to back up

403
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:48,550
is that fair yeah I don't ask people

404
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,260
that's really the number one but cloud

405
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:53,440
services are getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> better as to where</font>

406
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:55,000
like it does it for you so that's that's

407
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,380
nice yeah it's the number one thing they

408
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,110
Bank on is backups right this is a

409
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:02,650
consumer<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do a nightly back up the</font>

410
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,449
next day the a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people if I had a</font>

411
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,910
nightly back up and also and I can hit

412
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:10,770
at 9am i don't care i'm not paying the

413
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:13,300
ransom just gonna re imager you know so

414
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:15,430
for a consumer<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd say backups are</font>

415
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:18,040
important but they also play on the fact

416
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:21,670
that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people don't and a lot of</font>

417
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who do get hit there just is they</font>

418
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:25,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of wage like oh</font>

419
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,590
like is to bitcoins really worth all

420
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,750
this data inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> computer I have a</font>

421
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:35,990
USB Drive that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could just reload it</font>

422
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:37,940
with them so my next point hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

423
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:41,570
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> your question well my next point</font>

424
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:43,160
goes to kind of really is all about all

425
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,178
male<font color="#CCCCCC"> where right if you have depending</font>

426
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,190
on what platform you're trying to target

427
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:47,840
in most cases is windows if you have

428
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:50,299
knowledge of windows and turtles<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

429
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,270
api's and things like that then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

430
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:57,639
probably right decent decent malware I

431
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:59,750
think in my opinion I think the

432
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,179
knowledge of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows internals that you</font>

433
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,370
need for rent to write ransomware is

434
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:05,690
less than the knowledge of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows</font>

435
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,790
internals that you would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write a</font>

436
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,799
decent banking<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trojan because the</font>

437
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,780
pending Trojans looking to be more

438
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:16,400
subversive and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

439
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:21,200
crazy things<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the API and be more</font>

440
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:23,870
crafty if you will going on the

441
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,210
simplicity<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing still I bring somewhere</font>

442
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:30,530
projects exists for educational purposes

443
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:33,169
and this is um this is kind of a fiery

444
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:36,830
topic amongst some researchers where I

445
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:38,960
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know why people like like this</font>

446
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,370
malware sources that's leaked and like

447
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,110
you can look at the source code and go

448
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,909
through line by line and understand what

449
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:46,760
it does right but there's no reason

450
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,840
anybody in my mind maybe someone

451
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">couldn't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of one and let me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

452
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,889
there's no reason that I can think of

453
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,750
why you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would want to give people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

454
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:56,020
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the capability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to write their</font>

455
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:59,419
own the capability to write their own

456
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,929
because I guess the argument is what

457
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:05,419
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing now isn't enough to stop</font>

458
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:07,850
what's going on so let's make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it open</font>

459
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:10,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">source and maybe somebody will come up</font>

460
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:14,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">with an idea whereas I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the root of</font>

461
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:16,159
the problem is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not in its not</font>

462
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:19,580
that ransomware is complicated and we

463
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:24,610
have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea how to how to not let it</font>

464
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:28,189
run right it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

465
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:30,770
we this goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

466
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,320
Joe said in the keynote the ability to

467
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,610
stop fishing and the initial

468
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">vector like that's never going to stop</font>

469
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:37,000
and this nine times out of ten

470
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,559
ransomware payloads are probably going

471
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,340
to be delivered I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess actually exploit</font>

472
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:44,440
kits but range where<font color="#CCCCCC"> attempts are going</font>

473
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,850
to be delivered through fishing nine

474
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,830
times out of ten is a little much I

475
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:51,879
would say the majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

476
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:53,970
though that ransomware will be delivered

477
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,950
through fishing so I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

478
00:21:53,970 --> 00:22:00,100
open source ransomware is really a

479
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:02,440
necessity it's not like if I have the

480
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:05,019
source to some if I had sourcing some

481
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,649
some code or some web app right and i

482
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:12,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">was able find this year day i would I</font>

483
00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:14,559
wouldn't just spammed spam like a proof

484
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,758
of concept that's not malicious or

485
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,700
something like that but these are in

486
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,470
nature for educational purposes they

487
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,850
will encrypt your computer whereas most

488
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:26,759
of them have back doors or something

489
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:30,969
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they put in there's no reason just</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">sultana</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open source ransomware well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

491
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:36,309
see a lot of a lot of malware in the

492
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,840
wild people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will actually just copy and</font>

493
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:40,360
paste on stack overflow or something

494
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,389
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mm-hm in this particular case</font>

495
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:47,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we talked about this in</font>

496
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:50,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">the specification but i did find a post</font>

497
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:53,320
by somebody it was several years ago

498
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:55,090
with almost the exact structure of the

499
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,120
source code that appears in this piece

500
00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:00,490
of ransomware and it's they modified a

501
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:04,000
few things to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it fit for this</font>

502
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:05,830
particular scenario so I mean it's I

503
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,909
mean it's questionable I mean when

504
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:09,309
you're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like proof</font>

505
00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:12,850
of concept some people argue that well

506
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:17,559
if we know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of methods in</font>

507
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:19,059
which they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can attack or sort of get our</font>

508
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:23,379
hitter infrastructure than we can

509
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:26,379
prepare<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them really really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

510
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:28,658
know a good adequate<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense for this</font>

511
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:30,009
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> than for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the enterprise that we</font>

512
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:32,649
could tell you like a good enterprise

513
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:36,399
start data feed is like key for a

514
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:38,289
consumer for for enterprise like someone

515
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:40,658
could provide you a good like threat

516
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:42,399
data fee like intelligence feed so a lot

517
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:43,830
of companies out there I won't say a lot

518
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:46,018
but a good number of homeworld two

519
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,460
you they'll analyze a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of malware and</font>

520
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:49,679
then in their feet they'll give you a

521
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,880
lot of indicators and the reason that's

522
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,220
important is because they're probably

523
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,049
analyzing them and seeing halos faster

524
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,700
than company would so by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time the</font>

525
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:57,720
company gets the payload they're going

526
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,490
to ollie they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have those</font>

527
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,559
indicators so a couple things are going

528
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:03,179
to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> either they get infected and</font>

529
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:05,700
the payload can't communicate back to

530
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:07,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> c2 and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these cases if the</font>

531
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,779
payload can't communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not going</font>

532
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:12,539
to start encryption another thing that's

533
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:14,580
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen is it's not going to</font>

534
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:16,080
allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> it through right so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

535
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,850
those indicators if we have the hashes

536
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,610
of the payload we have the indicators to

537
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:22,260
try and communicate with it's not going

538
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,330
to get through and even if it does get

539
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:27,809
through we can easily have something

540
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:29,820
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> your seam software you know or some</font>

541
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:32,460
IDs isolate that particular machine

542
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,590
quickly off the network before it has a

543
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,539
chance to do any more<font color="#CCCCCC"> damage so for the</font>

544
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,010
enterprise and someone someone with a

545
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:39,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">good threat data feed is definitely help</font>

546
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,658
you out consumers a little bit more

547
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:44,730
difficult because those set data feeds

548
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:47,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">costs money you know big companies are</font>

549
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:50,850
paying a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> running form sometimes</font>

550
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:53,429
some of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies do share those</font>

551
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:56,519
indicators like a partnership with a

552
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:59,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">navy vendor it doesn't happen as much</font>

553
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:03,440
Holly because people are paying you know

554
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:03,440
people are selling that data yeah

555
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:18,379
so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you pay what for what you</font>

556
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:22,340
get unfortunately moving on a kind of

557
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:24,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">more of the compare and contrast like I</font>

558
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">said earlier banking charges have many</font>

559
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:30,590
more moving parts the delivery

00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:32,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">mechanisms really uh I think banking</font>

561
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:35,360
Trojans probably are more consistently

562
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:38,030
delivered through word docs where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

563
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,760
ransomware is a solid mixture of word

docs and windows script for<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript</font>

565
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:48,230
files I think more so and exploit kits

566
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:50,570
with like King had said<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier</font>

sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes if ransomware can't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">track the infection but they'll still</font>

00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:08,540
banking charges I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the control is a</font>

576
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:12,140
little more important because you have

577
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:17,060
you actually updated to exfiltrate and

578
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:18,650
web injects basically what weapons XR is

579
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:22,129
so like you navigate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your banking</font>

580
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:26,030
website right and the banking<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trojan</font>

581
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:27,560
will basically script an overlay kind of

582
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:29,360
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fly so that when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the</font>

583
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,919
banking website you're logging into

584
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,030
their their their scripted overlay and

585
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,070
that's how they grab your banking

586
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:42,290
credentials and things like that

587
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:45,379
anything to hit on web and expose the

588
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:47,149
delivery mechanism like i said<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier</font>

589
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,550
kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-size-fits-all really</font>

590
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:52,160
once they get the the payload on<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

591
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:53,870
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the victims computer then also</font>

592
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,850
thinking to do is get the victim to run

593
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:59,810
the payload and most people are going to

594
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:01,550
click things regardless so after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

595
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:03,790
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just uh it's the victim gonna pay</font>

596
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,790
or not

597
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:10,639
so characteristics of modern ransomware

598
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:13,820
delivery methods we kind of touched on

599
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:17,928
mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> setzer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phishing emails inside zip</font>

600
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:20,570
files what was big over the last three

601
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:22,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">weeks really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is like encrypted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Word</font>

602
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,899
documents where the word documents

603
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:26,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">password-protected those come through</font>

604
00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:29,139
with zero detection essentially and they

605
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:32,419
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the password in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the email to</font>

606
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:35,869
open the word doc and then they have the

607
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:38,659
classic enable macros<font color="#E5E5E5"> to view this</font>

608
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:40,279
content or something something along

609
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:42,139
those lines and then the macros will run

610
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:45,049
and download the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage payload</font>

611
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:46,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the those the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

612
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:50,679
the coolest<font color="#CCCCCC"> things I saw over the last</font>

613
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:53,509
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks or four weeks probably a</font>

614
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:56,299
variety of malicious actors as far as

615
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:57,950
skill level goes you have like the full

616
00:27:56,299 --> 00:28:00,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">development teams behind Lackey and</font>

617
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:03,799
server and the larger ransomware

618
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:06,978
campaigns and then you have more new

619
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:09,529
threat actors if you will kind of like

620
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:12,320
the the author behind Alma Alma

621
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:15,019
ransomware this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably their first</font>

622
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,960
first run at creating ransomware and

623
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:22,239
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of new ransomware</font>

624
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,239
out there that isn't done well because

625
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:26,418
even kids new to the block are trying to

626
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:28,399
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> money using this vector right</font>

627
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:30,139
that's why 2016 is the year of

628
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,478
ransomware because it's really exploded

629
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:37,209
so everybody wants a part of the

630
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:37,210
potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> success that ransomware offers</font>

631
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:44,939
so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> over kind of touching on low</font>

632
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,720
quality grants and where this will lead

633
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:51,659
into our more of what we found back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

634
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,820
August like I said everybody wants a

635
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:56,190
piece of the chunk everybody wants a

636
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,830
piece of the success that ransomware has

637
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:01,130
to offer so like I said you get new

638
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:04,110
variants and new families all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time</font>

639
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:08,820
like even even back in twenty sixteen i

640
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:12,270
remember in 2016 we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still here back</font>

641
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">in February ah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was the first day lock</font>

642
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:17,639
he was out somebody was able to crack<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

643
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:20,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">tour first couple of days and the next</font>

644
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next iteration of the payload came</font>

645
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:24,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a string inside and strut inside</font>

646
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,549
the palos like f you security

647
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:29,130
researchers or something similar to that

648
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:30,480
so even you inversions the lock he went

649
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:32,549
through iterations where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't</font>

650
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,549
perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sigma surber checkpoint was a</font>

651
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:38,010
really actually able to supply<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

652
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:40,139
decrypter<font color="#E5E5E5"> up until I think it was server</font>

653
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,879
it was a Persian server to then

654
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:45,480
definitely server to was out I don't

655
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">think server three was out there but up</font>

656
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,140
until when they put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i think it was</font>

657
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,450
around August eighteenth fish when they

658
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:54,240
put out their blog in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Decrypter they</font>

659
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:55,710
were able to decrypt files up until then

660
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,240
and then shortly<font color="#CCCCCC"> after they like the</font>

661
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,159
next two<font color="#CCCCCC"> days server came out and</font>

662
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:08,700
patched the weakness in their encryption

663
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:10,289
mechanism to mitigate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> papua a bunch</font>

664
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:13,760
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of ransomware families have</font>

665
00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:17,220
been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to undergo cracking and</font>

666
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,230
decryption by some security researchers

667
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,320
and then you have low quality family

668
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:23,820
variants like stampato new trip fading

669
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,939
somewhere which i think is like I'm

670
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:29,879
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> for in Phoenix locker all of</font>

671
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,890
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think they have perfect</font>

672
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,440
encryption yet I don't know that to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

673
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:39,539
one hundred percent true but last time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

674
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:43,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">checked that was the case so now talking</font>

675
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:46,770
more about what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> found and are</font>

676
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:47,860
our bread and butter in<font color="#E5E5E5"> August take it</font>

677
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:53,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">away</font>

678
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:57,020
so those of you who haven't ever don't

679
00:30:53,750 --> 00:31:00,650
know in some Slavic languages and also

680
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:03,950
in Hungarian alma is the word for<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple</font>

681
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:06,559
and what we found was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the payload itself</font>

682
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:08,480
was masquerading we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to trick a</font>

683
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,510
user into thinking that that the file

684
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,010
itself belong to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple we thought that</font>

685
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:15,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">was kind of interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where they</font>

686
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:18,530
called it Alma with that string in there

687
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:21,080
on the locker or I'm sorry so a lot of

688
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:23,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">people called the Alma locker bleeping</font>

689
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,250
computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was some other ones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

690
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,260
a difference between a locker and ransom

691
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,000
lockers<font color="#CCCCCC"> just trying to prevent access to</font>

692
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:32,000
computer as opposed to rain storm is

693
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,620
actually encrypting the files so when it

694
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,320
first came out there's a reason we came

695
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:38,780
out with all the ransomware and everyone

696
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,860
kept calling it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alma hawker so you'll</font>

697
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,350
see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other blogs out there</font>

698
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:44,870
saying on the locker it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing</font>

699
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:47,000
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a locker I guess some</font>

700
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:51,139
people don't understand certain types of

701
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,720
terminology so this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> one was</font>

702
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,520
delivered via rig exploit kit very

703
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,919
popular exploit kit so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't a</font>

704
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,840
phishing email or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that if</font>

705
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,539
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you don't know how fish or</font>

706
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,970
exploit kits work<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it's as</font>

707
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:06,470
simple as visiting website<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

708
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:08,929
is visit a website and it could cause

709
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:11,510
infection the way this works is the

710
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:13,820
exploit kit determines what your browser

711
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:15,230
is vulnerable to or perhaps you have a

712
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">plug-in that's vulnerable to something</font>

713
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,980
and a bunch of JavaScript rinds and

714
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:20,870
determine its ok that while they're

715
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,730
running you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know internet explorer with</font>

716
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:24,280
this particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what they do</font>

717
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,870
is they try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deliver a certain</font>

718
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:29,570
malicious file or most malicious payload

719
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:33,049
onto the system via that vulnerability

720
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:35,720
and that's why it's hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to defend</font>

721
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:37,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">against exploit kits is because the only</font>

722
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,570
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have for yourself is</font>

723
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,219
keeping your browser<font color="#E5E5E5"> and your plugins up</font>

724
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:45,168
to date that's the only defense you have

725
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:47,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">really no so exploit kit it's it's going</font>

726
00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:49,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">to exit provide the execution is</font>

727
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:51,770
complied the drop just complied the

728
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,840
execution a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who do these</font>

729
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:56,179
exploit kits<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's crime or as a service</font>

730
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,860
so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually you can't go out</font>

731
00:32:56,179 --> 00:33:01,220
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy like your own exploit kit</font>

732
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:03,439
what they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is you you rent</font>

733
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:06,200
like like say a day<font color="#CCCCCC"> how many days are</font>

734
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">ours to use the exploit kit right so in</font>

735
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:13,570
this case which is I thought this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

736
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:15,799
odd that such a new payload or

737
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,510
simplistic<font color="#CCCCCC"> fela really as far as ransom</font>

738
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:19,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">Burgos was being delivered</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a rig</font>

739
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:21,559
because once angler had gotten popped

740
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:23,990
back in June angler was really the

741
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:27,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">premier exploit kit rig kind of took</font>

742
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:31,070
over and tried to fill anglers shoes so

743
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:33,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was I was very surprised to see this</font>

744
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:36,260
being delivered<font color="#E5E5E5"> by rig okay so it was</font>

745
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:39,169
odd think we calculated that the threat

746
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:42,908
actor paid around five hundred dollars

747
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:47,120
for this particular payload to circulate

748
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:55,090
a break out there yes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really</font>

749
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:55,090
standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay nuts</font>

750
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:10,230
right so there's also a notable<font color="#CCCCCC"> too I</font>

751
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:13,230
mean there's a billion UAC bypasses out

752
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:15,089
there right which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that's not hard to</font>

753
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:18,629
craft if you've written an exploit kit

754
00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:21,119
you can write you a<font color="#CCCCCC"> see bypass but like</font>

755
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:25,129
even like dll sideloading that'll little

756
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:29,849
bypass UAC most of the time so surber<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

757
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:31,589
think two months ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> a month ago server</font>

758
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:33,720
server didn't get executed with Edmond

759
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:36,808
privileges it would prompt three times<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

760
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:39,058
<font color="#CCCCCC">met after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a minute each time for you to</font>

761
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:40,649
execute it as admin or for it to bump

762
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:43,020
it's Prince up this is because it

763
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:45,750
couldn't it's like to get the et Cie

764
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:49,759
 or not he TC shadow the shadow the

765
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:53,069
shadow copy of the shadow dr yeah yeah

766
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,770
yeah so if it couldn't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

767
00:34:53,069 --> 00:34:57,329
wasn't running a salmon or some some

768
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,430
sensitive files that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to encrypt</font>

769
00:34:57,329 --> 00:35:00,599
and it would prompt you three times and

770
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:04,230
if it didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it it's still</font>

771
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:05,940
encrypt just not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> not everything</font>

772
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:08,039
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted yeah that's another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

773
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,630
you have going for yourself that what a

774
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:12,029
lot of rain<font color="#CCCCCC"> smears will do is disable</font>

775
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:13,829
the volume shadow service and what that

776
00:35:12,029 --> 00:35:16,140
does is you know if you ever booted up

777
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:18,180
windows<font color="#E5E5E5"> it says we can there's something</font>

778
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:20,308
wrong try to boot up from the last known

779
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:22,379
good start up and then what it's doing

780
00:35:20,309 --> 00:35:23,640
is pulling copies from that volume

781
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,589
shadow service de probably try to bring

782
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">things back online so the first thing</font>

783
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:29,700
some ransomware will do is just disable

784
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:33,950
it all together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wipe it out you</font>

785
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,950
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that those</font>

786
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:43,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know I don't know about so far</font>

787
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:45,049
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not familiar with how that</font>

788
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:48,799
works but if they are backing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up sugar</font>

789
00:35:45,049 --> 00:35:50,630
heavy them yeah and it can't access it I

790
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:51,890
don't know where the backup goes like

791
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,990
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it right like if they</font>

792
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:57,109
encrypt the backup then it could be a

793
00:35:53,990 --> 00:36:01,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">good defense yeah I'd have to look more</font>

794
00:35:57,109 --> 00:36:04,779
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mm-hmm now the problem here is</font>

795
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:07,609
when we first saw it it was tripped by

796
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:10,250
one vendor and I can remember who that

797
00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:13,609
was get remember either basically we

798
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:14,960
checked I think was a month later and it

799
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:18,049
was like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was two or three</font>

800
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,049
vendors had this flag this malicious so

801
00:36:18,049 --> 00:36:23,359
and then only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of them actually</font>

802
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:27,980
knew it was ransomware so I mean he's

803
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:29,509
pretty bad I would say there's two I

804
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,099
mean I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go out there and say it hate</font>

805
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:36,650
to say but windows actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a good</font>

806
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:38,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">anti-virus uh-huh yeah I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I they</font>

807
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,950
don't know they know they know us better

808
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:41,210
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> most so like they're their</font>

809
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:44,299
detection rates are actually pretty good

810
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:46,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would say malwarebytes does a pretty</font>

811
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:48,380
good job because Persky does a pretty

812
00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:51,410
good job the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them are</font>

813
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,210
questionable that that's basic that

814
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:55,490
based on everything that we see we look

815
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:58,250
at a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different stuff mostly</font>

816
00:36:55,490 --> 00:37:02,508
ransomware and banking<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trojans shameless</font>

817
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:03,680
plugs bud yeah so even throw that out

818
00:37:02,509 --> 00:37:06,109
there but I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help out some</font>

819
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:13,700
consumers but was it was a major<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

820
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:14,900
that we seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have the best so those</font>

821
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,769
of you who<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what address space</font>

822
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:21,140
layout randomization is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ASL are</font>

823
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:23,779
basically what happens is it takes a

824
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:25,759
executable and it will load it in a

825
00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:28,390
random place of memory in an effort to

826
00:37:25,759 --> 00:37:32,390
prevent things like buffer overflows

827
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:34,730
this is more of a defense mechanism so

828
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:36,920
that way people can't perform

829
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:39,440
exploitation what was interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

830
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:42,290
this binary is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

831
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,150
and it's a lot of Mabel's and it's just

832
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:45,830
the sly little trick it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

833
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:48,890
that's easily disabled if you look

834
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:50,450
inside of the file<font color="#E5E5E5"> header the executable</font>

835
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:52,430
file header there is actually if you see

836
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:56,299
where I'm pointing to it says dll can

837
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:59,299
move you can all but in this particular

838
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:02,000
section or this application here<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFS</font>

839
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:04,580
explore that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular checkbox is what</font>

840
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">changes that information in the header</font>

841
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:09,500
and basically what that does is if that

842
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,880
wasn't checked basically what would

843
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,460
happen it was constantly loaded in the

844
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,690
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> location every time it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

845
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,370
really hinder analysis because like I

846
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:18,980
said we can load this up we can uncheck

847
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:20,359
that and we load the executable and when

848
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,430
we do our debugging session again it's

849
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,890
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be at the place we expected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

850
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:26,509
amenity so as analysts what we do is we

851
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:29,319
look at a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different malicious</font>

852
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:33,410
software and we use things like Ida or

853
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:35,630
Holly x64 dbg<font color="#E5E5E5"> buggers a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

854
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:37,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">things allow us to step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through the</font>

855
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:39,980
assembly code to see what the malicious

856
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:43,130
payload is doing and in this case is

857
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:44,870
just my guess a noobish sort of thing to

858
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:47,120
try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent analysis for some people</font>

859
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:50,720
and it did trip some people walk we who

860
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:52,940
use more automated fashion so people use

861
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,330
sort of automated debugging may have

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">that Jason alluded to is sometimes</font>

871
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:23,450
they'll rip your files even though they

872
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:24,680
don't have an internet connection and if

873
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> case a lot of times what</font>

874
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're using is something called</font>

875
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:31,750
symmetric key<font color="#E5E5E5"> cryptography and what that</font>

876
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:36,980
is is you have one key used for both

877
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:38,900
encryption and decryption another way

878
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,220
someone could do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a symmetric</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

879
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,760
you see some of the ransomware see this

880
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:46,370
is you have my pgp right you have to

881
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">keats and they have a very close</font>

882
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:49,819
mathematical relationship in the fact

883
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,130
that if you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> one key and in</font>

884
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:53,719
data with this one key<font color="#E5E5E5"> only this other</font>

885
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:56,029
key can decrypt it and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

886
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:57,890
forth so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you see this with PGP with</font>

887
00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:59,239
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> private and public key so you keep</font>

888
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,618
your private key to share your public

889
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:03,289
key so that way people want to send you

890
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:04,640
files that don't get intercepted they

891
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:06,529
can encrypt<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your public key and you</font>

892
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,150
can do for put your private key so what

893
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,680
happens is some of the rain square will

894
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,420
take advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this asymmetric</font>

895
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,359
cryptography in fact that they'll

896
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:17,839
generate the key here on the server send

897
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:19,670
you one part one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the keys encrypt</font>

898
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:21,469
everything so you never actually have

899
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:24,529
the other key on your box so you can

900
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:26,779
there's no way to really decrypt I mean

901
00:40:24,529 --> 00:40:28,309
you could potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it you drew</font>

902
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:31,009
force it but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by the time you get</font>

903
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:32,959
your dad as about 20 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether it's</font>

904
00:40:31,009 --> 00:40:35,630
important to you then and I I guess

905
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:37,190
that's up to you so in this particular

906
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:40,369
case they're using symmetric key

907
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:43,400
cryptography and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

908
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:44,900
haven't seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sort of data that looks</font>

909
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:48,650
like what we're pointing to there where

910
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:50,779
it says base64 what it is is it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

911
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:53,180
simple encoding use you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know send</font>

912
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:56,690
messages email attachments over the

913
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:58,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet and whether they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

914
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:00,170
printable characters and that's the

915
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:04,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason why people use this encoding so</font>

916
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:06,289
it's easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> transfer data so this sort</font>

917
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:08,839
of simplistic piece of ring somewhere

918
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:11,329
will send the initial response<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

919
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:13,640
server and if we actually base64 to go

920
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:16,219
to that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see a value</font>

921
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,989
indicated by<font color="#CCCCCC"> P and if you see this value</font>

922
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:21,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">here that's actually the encryption key</font>

923
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:24,650
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a yes also known as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ryan</font>

924
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:26,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">dale cipher so they're using that in an</font>

925
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:30,049
effort to encrypt the files on the

926
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:31,698
computer after the encrypter runs you're

927
00:41:30,049 --> 00:41:33,650
going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this with all ransomware</font>

928
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:36,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to get the bummer message</font>

929
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:39,709
here saying sorry making your files are

930
00:41:36,769 --> 00:41:41,328
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> locked now so they want you</font>

931
00:41:39,709 --> 00:41:43,308
to pay here so they give you

932
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:45,709
instructions downloading the Decrypter

933
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:50,209
and that way you can go and get your

934
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:52,480
files back if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to extortion I</font>

935
00:41:50,209 --> 00:41:56,149
guess

936
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:58,730
so the Decrypter a lot of tools we use

937
00:41:56,150 --> 00:42:01,580
in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community very how there's</font>

938
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:04,280
like several different tools to do the

939
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:10,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">same thing this particular tool what it</font>

940
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:12,170
does is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> takes signatures this is</font>

941
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:13,730
basically a database of signatures and

942
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:17,210
uses those signatures to try to identify

943
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:18,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the file is sort of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AV does it</font>

944
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:21,140
so you have more like y'all so basically

945
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:25,190
you have a bunch of signatures that will

946
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:28,670
identify what made the payload or what

947
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:30,800
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> hacker was used to make it you</font>

948
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:33,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what compiler was used this</font>

949
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,180
particular instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> Exe info tells us</font>

950
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:38,029
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting says this is</font>

951
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:40,580
a net payload if you see under there

952
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:43,070
where it says visual c visual c sharp

953
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,420
basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> map it's very important to us</font>

954
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:48,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">because we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to show you in a</font>

955
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:51,740
second why there was a Packard play we

956
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:53,390
might see it in there if it was written

957
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:57,319
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Delphie you'll probably see something</font>

00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:58,580
sitting Borland you know another<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular</font>

959
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,770
tool that's like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something</font>

960
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:04,700
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> PE ID that was used for many</font>

961
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:05,780
years this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> krypter so they give</font>

962
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,759
you instructions to download the

963
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:13,580
Decrypter here they give you a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin</font>

this to my left but<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the left second</font>

966
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:23,450
over you see that for sv<font color="#E5E5E5"> kju it picked a</font>

967
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:25,939
random extension to encrypt your files

968
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:29,240
with and this is the particular section

969
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:32,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">after our first execution to the right</font>

970
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:35,169
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see how much money we have to pay to</font>

971
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:37,520
get our files back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here we have our</font>

972
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:39,500
hours remaining to pay a ransom and

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,810
those of you who are not familiar with

ransom within the time allotted it

976
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:49,190
varies most people just uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> priam some</font>

977
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:52,490
they doubled it so instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of paying</font>

978
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:54,890
what bitcoin you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take two etc so</font>

979
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:57,169
based on this they may give you some

980
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:59,890
some places where you can go buy your

981
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:01,630
bitcoins and pay them off with

982
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,098
you can click check pavement and what it

983
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:10,480
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it tries to see if you paid the</font>

984
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:12,400
ransom or not so when the Decrypter is

985
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,859
run it sends some information back to

986

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> c2 so what we did was we loaded up</font>

987

something called Wireshark if there's

Network Monitor anything that captures

990
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:29,589

00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:09,460
where I have that first arrow then

1005
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:11,258
you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the response so like the hcp</font>

1006
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:13,839
200 there's a response from the server

1007
00:45:11,259 --> 00:45:15,549
and there's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> post from us and</font>

1008
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,430
then the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> response from the server</font>

1009
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:21,700
it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hard you should probably</font>

1010
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:25,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">look yeah yeah so the Decrypter does two</font>

1011
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:27,430
posts the first post to i dot PHP is

1012
00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:29,799
just the victims identifier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to inform</font>

1013
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:32,919
the c2 which victim is trying to

1014
00:45:29,799 --> 00:45:34,390
communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to dig</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to form the CT which</font>

1015
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,509
victim is trying to communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font>

1016
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:39,190
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the decrypt or the c2 will then</font>

1017
00:45:37,509 --> 00:45:42,339
respond with like King had said the

1018
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:43,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bitcoin wallet address the four</font>

1019
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:46,480
character extension just the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1020
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:51,250
we saw populated<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the Decrypter on the</font>

1021
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:54,039
previous slide and then again it posts

1022
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:57,759
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see dot PHP or what I believe stands</font>

1023
00:45:54,039 --> 00:46:00,160
for check to see in CF the victim has

1024
00:45:57,759 --> 00:46:01,869
paid check of the victim is paid and it

1025
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,019
just responds with them the wallet

1026
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:04,019
address

1027
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:14,890
so the assert the community control was

1028
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:16,390
on tour yeah well it's communicating

1029
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:19,150
overt or wherever that server was

1030
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:22,060
somewhere right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards just like an</font>

1031
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:35,040
anonymizing service so it was

1032
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:37,660
communicating with onion yeah sorry

1033
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,640
onion dot link so it's a way of getting

1034
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:43,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">at tour services without having a tor</font>

1035
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,410
browser so that's what they were doing

1036
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:48,490
yeah because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you try to go straight</font>

1037
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:50,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">on Ian without reception I believe in</font>

1038
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:53,500
the initial infection page like if you

1039
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:55,210
can't navigate to one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> four four</font>

1040
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,260
nodes or whatever they<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave you then</font>

1041
00:46:55,210 --> 00:47:00,160
they provide you with the link to

1042
00:46:56,260 --> 00:47:01,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">download tour so the reason I was</font>

1043
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,589
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> before why it's important</font>

1044
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:08,170
that the payload<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fitness is because</font>

1045
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:10,780
there's some very popular tools out

1046
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:12,490
there that allow there's some very

1047
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:15,130
popular tools out there that allow you

1048
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:19,330
to sort of pull a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of metadata out of</font>

1049
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:21,730
there and with net it's similar to java

1050
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:23,770
so when you compile<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java code it turns</font>

1051
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:27,160
into something called bytecode so it's

1052
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:29,980
not straight native native code that's

1053
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:32,379
running on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU or so basically what</font>

1054
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:35,050
happens is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will compile something</font>

1055
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:36,880
called intermediate language<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IL and I</font>

1056
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:39,520
elf contains so much metadata that we

1057
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,560
get pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost the same exact</font>

1058
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,840
source code that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the developer road and</font>

1059
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,000
in this case you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see we got pretty</font>

1060
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:48,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">much everything back they had a little</font>

1061
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit obfuscation but not much and so this</font>

1062
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:52,480
right here you're seeing is the initial

1063
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:55,150
post from the Decrypter to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> command</font>

1064
00:47:52,480 --> 00:48:00,040
control checking to see if we paid our

1065
00:47:55,150 --> 00:48:02,950
ransom so you say you have a file on

1066
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:04,430
your computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> a txt file once it's</font>

1067
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:07,419
encrypted<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you try to</font>

1068
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:10,069
you're going to see something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1069
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:12,770
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just the result of the aes</font>

1070
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:17,840
encryption happening with the key we

1071
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:20,720
showed earlier now those<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you took</font>

1072
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:23,900
Jason<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gilliam's class learn about things</font>

1073
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:26,629
like for these all these other different

1074
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:29,660
tools fiddler is another tool that we

1075
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:31,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do sort of me in the middle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tex so</font>

1076
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:35,210
what we can do here is as you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

1077
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:37,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">when we run the Decrypter on the right</font>

1078
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:39,110
there the first box you see where he

1079
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:41,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">says decrypt traffic what we're</font>

1080
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:43,700
selecting there is the Decrypter that's

1081
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:45,320
running and then what we do towards the

1082
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,029
bottom here is break upon post because

1083
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,890
what happens is decrypter is crimes are

1084
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:51,920
going to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do an HTTP POST back to</font>

1085
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:54,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> c2 in an effort to sort of</font>

1086
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,410
communicate playing on playing on the

1087
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:59,660
effect that this actor then in my

1088
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:02,629
opinion wasn't was new to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scene of</font>

1089
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:05,509
malware really shortly after the

1090
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:08,150
campaign went live the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traumatic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> troll</font>

1091
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:09,950
went down and you were no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to able</font>

1092
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:13,010
the Decrypter you no longer able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1093
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:16,100
download the Decrypter which just<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes</font>

1094
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:18,680
to show how really not robust the

1095
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:20,480
infrastructure was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so like</font>

1096
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:23,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">being said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this in what we're about</font>

1097
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:26,600
to do basically is act as the sea tube

1098
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:30,970
and provide the Decrypter with the data

1099
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:35,450
necessary to decrypt the victims files

1100
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:38,810
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see it we hit the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> break it posted</font>

1101
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:41,419
and what we do here is we are supplying

1102
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:42,560
a DAT file reason we do that is in the

1103
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">bottom right there you can really type</font>

1104
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:47,150
stuff in to fiddler so you have to

1105
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:49,730
supply a file with our data and here

1106
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:51,680
we're sending back data pretending where

1107
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:53,960
the command and<font color="#E5E5E5"> control center back to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what'd he do like he said we're gonna</font>

1111
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:04,650
break on post so as the post goes

1112
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:07,220
through initially we crafted a dot DAT

1113
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:10,020
file and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can choose response</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:12,240

drop down box but we were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1116
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:17,819
populate the data file with the data

1117
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:20,490
necessary for the Decrypter to believe

1118
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:22,320
that we were the c2 and it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1119
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:24,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">fun at first like I was like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making like</font>

1120
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:27,300
500 bitcoins in like negative seven

1121
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:28,800
hours to pay and doing all these crazy

1122
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,140
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what the Decrypter would</font>

1123
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:36,330
do so those uh we had a little fun with

1124
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:37,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">it first the next response that we</font>

1125
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:40,350
assumed was going to go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1126
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:45,419
Decrypter since we weren't sure exactly

1127
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:47,040
since the c2 went offline was the key so

1128
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:49,440
all we did was send back the key to the

1129
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:53,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">krypter and that's what you're seeing</font>

1130
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:55,110
here in the bottom right<font color="#CCCCCC"> we choose after</font>

1131
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,790
another break on<font color="#CCCCCC"> post</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we choose a deck</font>

1133
00:50:56,790 --> 00:51:01,370
populates on the bottom right there and

1134
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:04,020
then we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> click run to completion and</font>

1135
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:06,930
when we do that you'll notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on</font>

1136
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:08,280
the bottom now we have the what we

1137
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:09,870
didn't have been able before where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,180
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Crypt single bond</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the files</font>

1139
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:16,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have the ability to start hard</font>

1140
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:18,839
decryption process so basically what

1141
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:20,460
what you just saw there is similar

1142
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:22,080
technique a lot of hackers<font color="#E5E5E5"> use to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> man</font>

00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:27,319
doing it to a victim we're actually

1145
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:29,459
doing it to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of ransomware and</font>

1146
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,820
if you see the decryption key that's

1147
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:34,920
been populated up there sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of put a</font>

1148
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:37,410
box around it and after running it we

1149
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,000
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can get our text back</font>

cryptid earlier the reason this is

1152
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:45,299
important is because you can see some

sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sort of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weaknesses that</font>

1155
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:52,259
this might help some people out there

<font color="#CCCCCC">who actually in the field there are</font>

we release information like this sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

share with the community what we found

it might be useful for others

00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:12,319
and you know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go through and see</font>

1164
00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:15,828
some of these ransomware variants we've

1165
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:17,660
seen a rise dramatic increase in a

they have the encryption correct also

1186
00:53:00,859 --> 00:53:04,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">really need to worry about is getting it</font>

1189
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:14,810
more ransomware of lower quality as

1190
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:17,660
newer actors try to basically make money

1191
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:20,599
or get a chunk of a chunk<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1192
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:22,640
ransomware our cake yeah it's a mask

1193
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:24,560
last thing right they don't care who

1194
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:27,379
they encrypt it's when people to get

1195
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:29,000
encrypted they want it's just the reason

1196
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:31,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are banking on it now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and is so</font>

1197
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,630
much of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's because it's working and</font>

1198
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:34,550
since it's working everybody's<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

1199
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:37,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a piece of the pie so sending out</font>

1200
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:38,839
halos like crazy and effort to get so if

1201
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:40,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have even if they get for bitcoins</font>

1202
00:53:38,839 --> 00:53:42,049
they don't care and if what's funny is

1203
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:43,550
if you actually go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and negotiate</font>

1204
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:45,050
with that I mean can be like wow I'll

1205
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:47,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">have for bitcoins how about I pay you to</font>

1206
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:51,230
like a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them will actually take it</font>

1207
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:54,009
and give you the decryption key so keep

1208
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:56,390
that in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> so our non shameless plugs</font>

appreciate it quick references questions

1217
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:21,078
suffer um try to figure out her

1218
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:32,670
understand how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bonanzaville</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attack</font>

1219
00:54:21,079 --> 00:54:34,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">back so how so so as we saw the initial</font>

1220
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:37,079
key go across right because it was using

1221
00:54:34,799 --> 00:54:39,410
symmetric encryption so we saw the key

1222
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:42,510
go across during the original encryption

1223
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:49,770
so it was trying to tell the sea to say

1224
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:52,530
in the base64 encoded data 12 right here

1225
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:55,980
yeah so this first chunk right here is

1226
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:57,240
this p equals is that first chunk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

1227
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:00,089
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard for you to see but it's</font>

1228
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:03,270
CDX or whatever goes across there so if

1229
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:05,130
you base64 decode that it's the first

1230
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:08,030
value is the key along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1231
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:10,260
metadata about the victims<font color="#CCCCCC"> computer</font>

1232
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:13,559
there is also a weakness<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1233
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:15,089
algorithm we didn't publish this but we

1234
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:16,740
did find out there's about five

1235
00:55:15,089 --> 00:55:19,880
different artifacts that uses on the

1236
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:22,589
user's computer to generate the key so

1237
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:25,079
knowing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well we don't</font>

1238
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:27,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily need the key from this as</font>

1239
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:29,789
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a there's another way we</font>

1240
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:35,339
could get at the key by knowing certain

1241
00:55:29,789 --> 00:55:38,069
information about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer um it</font>

1242
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:39,480
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same head some of the like</font>

1243
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:41,640
the mac address was taken into account

1244
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,770
yeah who's the system time I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1245
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,808
so yeah there were certainly took

1246
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:47,940
valleys several values into account to

1247
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:50,609
basically basically threw them into a

1248
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:53,450
vendor and spit IES<font color="#CCCCCC"> key wonder my phone</font>

1249
00:55:50,609 --> 00:55:53,450
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1250
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:59,170
and harder<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you think they don't do</font>

1251
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:01,450
that because well an asymmetric right

1252
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:02,800
the key would the private key or the key

1253
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:08,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to decrypt would probably be on</font>

1254
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:09,820
the server yeah so so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

1255
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:12,280
noobish way it's easier to deal with

1256
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:13,690
symmetric key encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to it so</font>

1257
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:19,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think they're just copy and pasting</font>

1258
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:21,850
code and in this effort they didn't need

1259
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:23,859
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to connect to the internet to start</font>

1260
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:25,270
encrypting a lot of those asymmetric

1261
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,530
things they what they do is they

1262
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:28,630
generate the key pair of the community

1263
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:30,310
control sets server and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they grab a</font>

1264
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:32,110
key from there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they start</font>

1265
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:34,299
encrypting so in this particular case

1266
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:36,010
maybe they were worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

1267
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:46,090
wouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to encrypt certain I</font>

1268
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:48,880
don't know well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought about it we</font>

1269
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:52,480
released a generic decrypter that sort

1270
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:55,840
of helps if we had might do a follow-up

1271
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:59,470
blog but if we had the particular

1272
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:01,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">machine that was infected with certain</font>

1273
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:04,660
other information say at the time of

1274
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:07,600
affection which we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> easily get we</font>

1275
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:15,120
could recreate the key that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was used to</font>

1276
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:15,120
encrypt so was this is sold as I

1277
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:24,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">programmer you think the person I feel</font>

1278
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:28,369
as if that was a solo operation I just

1279
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:31,940
like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not gonna say but I I'm pretty</font>

1280
00:57:28,369 --> 00:57:33,920
sure I know who wrote it and the reason

1281
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:40,099
is is because it is someone in the

1282

community in the field yeah so you see

1283
00:57:40,099 --> 00:57:42,920
that too right you see a lot of people

1284
00:57:41,269 --> 00:57:44,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the field like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some some people may</font>

1285
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:46,910
be like oh like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason pointed out</font>

1286
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:48,799
and making like all this money I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font>

1287
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:50,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">try to get in on that so you have like</font>

1288
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,829
you have your white hats and black hats

1289
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:53,509
and you have the gray hat sort of this

1290
00:57:51,829 --> 00:58:00,619
white hat hacker job and by night their

1291
00:57:53,510 --> 00:58:12,130
writing cheating ransom or it is it

1292
00:58:00,619 --> 00:58:17,809
would be of the shittiest quality right

1293
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:19,640
yeah like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said like a lot of ransom or</font>

1294
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:21,769
even if you look at locky locky has made

1295
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:24,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably the most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wanting in the ransom</font>

1296
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:27,169
or field blocky is not a complicated

1297
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:30,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">palest it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very complicated at all</font>

1298
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:31,309
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason is is because a lot of</font>

1299
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,900
malware authors even with banking

1300
00:58:31,309 --> 00:58:36,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">trojans they're going to take the least</font>

1301
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:39,200
amount of effort for it to run and get

1302
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:41,299
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> many victims as possible so like say</font>

1303
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:43,069
they expect their campaign to run for a

1304
00:58:41,299 --> 00:58:45,410
day or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two and most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the victims are</font>

1305
00:58:43,069 --> 00:58:47,119
going to get my<font color="#E5E5E5"> first day so say it</font>

1306
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:49,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">takes you three days to reverse their</font>

1307
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:51,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">halo they don't care but at time they've</font>

1308
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:52,910
already spit out another binary with new

1309
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,530
see two so they don't care if you

1310
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:58,770
reverse it or not I was gay

1311
00:58:55,530 --> 00:59:01,470
so these are guys that you know instead

1312

00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:21,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">pictures to do infinity rather you know</font>

1314
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:24,509
was plenty of money for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you know so</font>

1315
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:30,990
I've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of mobile in the past</font>

1316
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:34,410
year like<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual mobile stuff and the</font>

1317
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:35,910
coolest mobile Android exploits that

1318
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:39,629
I've seen so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't seen much iOS</font>

1319
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:45,060
stuff there's stuff out there but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

1320
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:47,280
an exploit kit delivering geo<font color="#E5E5E5"> hots throw</font>

1321
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:50,490
a towel root exploit which was a silent

1322
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,960
route back in 2014 so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem of the</font>

1323
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:54,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android is right like a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

1324
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:56,550
they're stuck on previous versions so

1325
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:58,710
they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to basically silently</font>

1326
00:59:56,550 --> 01:00:00,540
root the phone and then execute the

1327
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:02,340
payload US route which was able doing

1328
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:05,250
like I think was a locker so the

1329
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:07,860
encrypted the phone so mobile platforms

1330
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:09,270
are being targeted more with craftier

1331
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:12,810
craft your<font color="#E5E5E5"> payloads coming out which</font>

1332
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:14,610
kind of cool yeah you can see a lot of

1333
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:17,190
the usage nowadays most people use a

1334
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:19,110
mobile device as stated<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier so we</font>

1335
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:23,610
expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to receive a rise in those things</font>

1336
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:29,280
like io t mobile devices though your

1337
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:32,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">bluetooth toilets probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sure push</font>
