2014 I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I don't</font>

51
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,760
understand the jargon right I'm just

52
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:27,230
sitting there and I'm just like in these

53
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,909
talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> because my significant others</font>

54

55
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:32,090
and everything like that I'm listening

56
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:37,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">to these talks and most of the jargon is</font>

57
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:41,239
going true and I'm realizing I'm getting

58
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:44,388
hungry and I start to tune in to what

59
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:48,310
I'm hearing I start noticing I'm hearing

60
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:50,900
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of food being talked about but</font>

61
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:54,590
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about food they're</font>

62
00:03:50,900 --> 00:04:00,699
talking about various portions of info

63
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:02,720
SEC so and that's because everything

64
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:06,819
everything in life revolves around food

65
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:11,780
put in infosec it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worse</font>

66
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:14,959
so because I was hearing about hashes

67
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:17,599
and salting the hashes and security

68
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:22,030
onion and onion salt and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going i</font>

72
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:39,739
things that I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> make deliciousness</font>

73
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:43,160

75
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,330
notebook which I got in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> backpack at</font>

76
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,550

00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:40,380
is the opposite<font color="#E5E5E5"> side from mine of one of</font>

145
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,590
the big tech companies that we all owe

146
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:47,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">our souls 2 and and lots and lots of</font>

147
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:52,640
money so we'll go it let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

148
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:56,010
breakfast who had breakfast this morning

149
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,910
awesome awesome those of you who didn't

150
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:01,290
and normally do you will might even you

151
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,959
didn't grab a cookie or an<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple you</font>

152
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">might want to you will be hungry by the</font>

153
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,770
end of this so where should we start

154
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:12,600
getting an infosec right would breakfast

155
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:14,579
hashes salting the hash is the first

156
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,770
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought of when hashes were hash</font>

157
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,140
browns I know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other people</font>

158
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:22,110
immediately thought something else when

159
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:25,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">they heard hashes but this was the first</font>

160
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,910
thing that popped into my mind first

161
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,350
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course you want to</font>

162
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,630
salt the hash you need a little bit of

163
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,460
flavor<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the hash browns</font>

164
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:39,560
right salted it then it makes delicious

165
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:42,950
that is not what it really is um hashes

166
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:45,380
I had to look these things up I'm sad to

167
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">say like I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am a newbie in infosec</font>

168
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,300
but I did my<font color="#CCCCCC"> research to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best of my</font>

169
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:52,670
ability instead of giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> you quoted</font>

170
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,849
things I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of generalize it for the</font>

171
00:09:52,670 --> 00:10:00,199
best I could hashes collected collection

172
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:03,770
of keys and variables that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm values</font>

173
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,870
that for you truly use for passwords and

174
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:08,569
it just kind of mixes them up a little

175
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:12,110
when you salt it adds some more stuff to

176
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:13,910
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> garb garbage and jargon that gets</font>

177
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:17,570
understood by whatever you're putting

178
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:21,620
your password into but it makes it more

179
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:30,110
difficult for those with questionable

180
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:34,130
morals to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hold of them so so well</font>

181
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:40,300
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> culinary sense too much salt is</font>

182
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:40,300
bad it's not necessarily bad in infosec

183
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:47,599
so we will continue let's go to the next

184
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:51,230
bit all right so who has onions and

185
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,580
onion salt in your kitchen who has no

186
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,580
clue what they've got in their kitchen i

187
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:06,380
have millions i have onion salt they use

188
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:09,189
both and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't she does so i got us</font>

189
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,189
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

190
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:14,709
I got to thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

191
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,959
because they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking scared young</font>

192
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:19,989
and I'm like onion that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I heard</font>

193
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:23,439
was onion not security I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard</font>

194
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:26,529
onions like onions made me<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of</font>

195
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">Shrek actually onions onions huggers</font>

196
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:30,310
have layers because onions have layers

197
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,790
and I'm just like and then you watch him

198
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:36,520
eat<font color="#CCCCCC"> that thing and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was like they used</font>

199
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:41,740
to they usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elgin's you Scott get</font>

200
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:43,449
eaten by like fruit but but this isn't

201
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:49,990
really what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're talking about an</font>

202
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:53,230
infosec is it must be security onion

203
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:55,680
which is a distribution of linux has a

204
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:58,180
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different things in it and</font>

205
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,160
we must also be<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about onion salt</font>

206
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:06,569
which was created written<font color="#CCCCCC"> by mike reeves</font>

207
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:12,930
for salt as salt for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> security onion</font>

208
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:12,930
distribution of linux so

209
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:22,040
apparently a onion salt I had last I saw

210
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:25,949
it was updated here it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 20th of</font>

211
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:28,430
January 2015 that was the last update

212
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:32,880
that I saw on the security of onion

213
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:36,660
website so i don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they're still</font>

214
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,009
updating it or or what hopefully they

215
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:43,259
are because it looked like it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

216
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:52,889
cool so you hungry yet ready for the

217
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:56,610
main course<font color="#CCCCCC"> mmm pulled pork nope pulled</font>

218
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:58,529
pork well you're in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> south man who</font>

219
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:02,660
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like barbecue and we are in</font>

220
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:04,860
South Carolina where barbecue is pork

221
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:13,709
you're not in the Midwest words beef

222
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:17,699
it's okay but wait so what it really is

223
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:21,410
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> dated program it's what snork uses</font>

224
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:24,060
for rule management I think the guy who

225
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,949
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing the talk when he talked about</font>

226
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">pulled pork I immediately thought of you</font>

227
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:30,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what you put into a crackpot and</font>

228
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,190
you leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there for hours and hours</font>

229
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you come at it with your Forks and</font>

230
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,240
pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> it apart and no and then you</font>

231
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:41,000
mentioned snort and I'm like that

232
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't jive with pulled pork in my head</font>

233
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,639
this is true it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not supposed to be</font>

234
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,620
snorting at that point if it's shorting

235
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,260
at that point then something's<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong and</font>

236
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:57,930
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> crock-pot is messed up or someone</font>

237
00:13:52,260 --> 00:14:00,029
missed a few steps but and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

238
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,279
lie I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my favorite snort</font>

239
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:07,370
picture that I have come across on the

240
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:07,370
interwebs at all ever

241
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:19,209
so this one the next one I misheard this

242
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:22,059
I missed heard this or i misremembered

243
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:27,219
it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought a sliced salami I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

244
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:28,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">wrote down sliced salami know when I</font>

245
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,449
went looking for it i discovered its

246
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:36,549
salami slicing which is a form of attack

247
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:39,488
that people use to get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses like</font>

248
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:43,779
little bits of information you will see

249
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:45,610
the movie hackers oh that's such a small

250
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:48,249
number those of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> who have not seen</font>

251
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:51,899
movie hackers go watch it it is a

252
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:54,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">perfect example of salami slicing</font>

253
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:57,279
perfect example the attack that's in

254
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,589
there I mean in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the things</font>

255
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I found that were when I was</font>

256
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:03,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">researching it and found that I had it</font>

257
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:05,439
named wrong actually referenced the

258
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,149
movie hackers a reference a few other

259
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:18,998
movies but hackers was in there it's

260
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:21,040
like yeah cuz I like yes acid burn keep

261
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:23,379
going for deliciousness how about some

262
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,498
fruit I mean we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got some apples right</font>

263
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:30,639
so how about there's other other fruit

264
00:15:25,499 --> 00:15:33,189
pineapples wait a minute what do you

265
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:38,100
mean that pineapples aren't fruit when

266
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:41,889
it comes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec do we mean oh oh</font>

267
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:45,610
right right it's also a networking thing

268
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:48,309
but I didn't figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I needed actual</font>

269
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:50,319
text on this slide to explain pineapples

270
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:53,799
because pretty sure that that picture

271
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:55,179
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of speaks for itself for a little</font>

272
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:57,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit when I first heard about pineapples</font>

273
00:15:55,179 --> 00:16:00,069
I'd never seen one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm like why did</font>

00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:05,980
they call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> pineapple and then I saw</font>
