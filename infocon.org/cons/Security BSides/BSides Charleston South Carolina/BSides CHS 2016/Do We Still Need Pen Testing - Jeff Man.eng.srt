00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,220
agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> today a little bit about me which</font>

3
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,070
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about what I'm</font>

4
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,488
thinking of why the talk why<font color="#E5E5E5"> why are we</font>

5
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,989
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> pen testing basically i'm</font>

6
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:35,790
going to give you my thoughts and ideas

7
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,260
and hopefully was some time to discuss

8
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">it at the end of the time there's my</font>

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,199
contact information if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys ever</font>

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,610
want to get in<font color="#E5E5E5"> touch with me by the end</font>

11
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:46,409
of the talk if you still want to speak

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:51,059
to me that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I used to look like</font>

13
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:55,920
back in my pen testing at NSA days when

14
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:58,140
I had hair and had power you guys have

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever heard of Paul security weekly I'm</font>

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,549
one of the hosts there I try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,019
there least once a month I'm getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

18
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:07,619
there more often now since i'm actually

19
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,890
currently unemployed i'm also a Jedi

20
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:13,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">Master there's a story behind that which</font>

21
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,200
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have time to tell but really I'm</font>

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,520
a Trekkie the original<font color="#E5E5E5"> series not any of</font>

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,770
the cheap imitation remains my 33 years

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,499
of information and security experience

25
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,449
starting at in and say ending up as aqsa

26
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:29,548
and then you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last couple years</font>

27
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">just been doing kind of the evangelism</font>

29
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,799
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started it and I say everybody</font>

30
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,530
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is what is that</font>

31
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,450
thing this is interactive things it's

32
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,819
the Enigma thank you it was still a

33
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,520
secret that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we and our allies the</font>

34
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:52,470
Brits had broken that why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:56,289
that is nope

36
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:59,170
there are countries still using it it

37
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:02,260
was not revealed i started in 86 at NSA

38
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,540
it wasn't revealed that that technology

39
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:09,070
had been broken I want to say to like 88

40
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:11,560
89 something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that while I was it</font>

41
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:15,010
and I say primarily as i was telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

42
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,480
get ripped analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> i bounced around i</font>

43
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,459
was actually there there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

44
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,739
conflict in the desert before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

45
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,950
13 years called Desert Shield Desert

46
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,840
Storm I was involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that from the</font>

47
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:30,160
civilian side of things on the on the

48
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:33,520
operational side and then what I was

49
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,829
telling you guys initially was<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got</font>

50
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,840
into penn testing at NSA we were setting

51
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,970
up doing ethical hacking pen testing

52
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,730
because the office that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was in was</font>

53
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,859
fielded systems evaluations<font color="#E5E5E5"> i gave a</font>

54
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,540
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my old days as a creepy can</font>

55
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,680
find it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> youtube it's called Tales</font>

56
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,030
from the Crypt analyst I ended up in

57
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">this office it was called fielded</font>

58
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,670
systems evaluations NSA discovered or

59
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,890
somebody had this brilliant idea that

60
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,958
the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we often break the</font>

61
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,329
adversaries communication systems and

62
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,030
encryption systems is we as people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

63
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,730
use them right they reuse key they

64
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,580
forget to<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch some switches they find</font>

65
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:15,940
bat bypasses is<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you know any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

66
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,350
sound familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> I disagreed with one</font>

67
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,640
thing the keynote said that he said

68
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,260
something about how pen testing has

69
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,940
changed so much in the industry has

70
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">changed so much over the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years I'm like</font>

71
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:27,400
yeah I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's changed much at</font>

72
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:29,260
all that's another talk but because we

73
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,880
were doing fielded systems evaluations

74
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,739
and there was and networking was

75
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,900
becoming more<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular we started looking</font>

76
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:36,780
at network systems which got us into pen

77
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,610
testing and ethical hacking and

78
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:43,330
vulnerability discovery and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

79
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,590
forth anybody heard of this book now

80
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,810
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get a voucher for a</font>

81
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,310
free book I might recommend this it came

82
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">out earlier this year it's a book called</font>

83
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:56,549
dark territory the secret history of

84
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:59,410
cyber war there's a chapter chapter<font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font>

85
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:01,389
called eligible receiver and in that

86
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,400
chapter there's this following statement

87
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:05,270
the NSA had a similar group called the

88
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,520
red team as<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the information</font>

89
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">insurance director director had formerly</font>

90
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,000
called the information security

91
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,940
Directorate the defensive side of the

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,070
NSA stationed in Phoenix the building

93
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,100
out near friendship airport during its

94
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,360
most sensitive drills the red team

95
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,490
worked out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a chamber called the pit</font>

96
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,680
which was so secret that few people that

97
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,150
NSA knew it existed and even they

98
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,850
couldn't enter without first passing

99
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:32,060
through combination lot two combination

100
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:34,280
locks doors are you intrigued or you

101
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,450
excited the pit is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> name of the</font>

102
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,489
office I used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work in so we're famous</font>

103
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:42,740
this is the fanx complex they actually

104
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,050
spelled it wrong in the book is just FNX

105
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,880
this is right outside of bwi airport if

106
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,030
he's ever flown into or out of bwi

107
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,670
airport and it's a was most of those

108
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:57,229
buildings and still might be today for

109
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:58,580
all I know and friendship annex BWI

110
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,500
Airport used to be called friendship

111
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:04,039
airport so it was just friendship the

112
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:06,230
airport annex friendship and it the pit

113
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,600
was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that building there and it was on</font>

114
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,910
cash flow<font color="#CCCCCC"> floor his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own it was 20 years</font>

115
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:15,530
ago I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say we were on the second</font>

116
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:18,650
floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that corner I give another talk</font>

117
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:20,780
about those times be on the lookout for

118
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,359
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually submitted it for shmoocon</font>

119
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,400
hope so waiting to see whether they'll

120
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,150
accept it or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again that's</font>

121
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,460
another story for another day<font color="#E5E5E5"> pentesting</font>

122
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:33,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">I started to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys I came out in</font>

123
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,849
the commercial world I did pen testing

124
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:38,060
for about five years in the commercial

125
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:41,180
world and then got away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> it got into</font>

doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI work USA work and you know</font>

127
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,190
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wasn't doing anything technical</font>

128
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,669
per se for quite a few years and only

129
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:51,140
got back into it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

130
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:56,060
when I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming out to conferences</font>

131
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:57,620
again so I'm at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Derby</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> con 2014</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scotus</font>

as the presenter he's giving a keynote

133
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:04,070
on how to do the how to give the best

134
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,570
pen test of your life and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh</font>

135
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,640
that's cool i'm going to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font>

136
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,140
pen testing has changed over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last 10</font>

137
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,780
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so years since</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i've been sort of a</font>

138
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,219
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the hacker community and so I'm</font>

139
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,650
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there listening very</font>

140
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,180
anxiously and and these are some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

your life has great value provides

145
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,099
previously unknown insights so on and so

146
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,230
forth he talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about know you've got</font>

147
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,510
limited budget living<font color="#E5E5E5"> a limited amounts</font>

148
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,310
unlimited amounts of time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you</font>

149
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:38,390
know go everywhere do everything get all

150
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:40,670
the best results but it kind of left me

151
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,900
I got a I got a little bit irritated

152
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,310
while I'm listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this talk it</font>

153
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:47,979
bugged me a little bit because<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of</font>

154
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:50,360
all he didn't define what a pen test was

155
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,500
and I think that's kind of important

156
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,360
because if you don't know what you're

157
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:58,010
getting into how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if you're</font>

158
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,230
been successful or not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> even beyond</font>

159
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:02,390
defining a pen test just defining what

160
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:04,160
the goals of a pen test are I mean what

161
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,900
is a pen test anybody what I mean

162
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,700
assuming there's no right or wrong

163
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:12,250
answer anybody want to take a stab at

164
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:16,250
what is a pen test test controlled

165
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:18,820
assessment of the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I mean</font>

166
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:21,919
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> were you know that's keep going I</font>

167
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:24,260
mean a pen test can be many many things

168
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">I found in the early days when I came</font>

169
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:29,570
out it's been 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago into the</font>

170
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,830
commercial sector everybody wanted to

171
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,169
have a pen test because everybody was

172
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,719
plugging their networks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their their</font>

173
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:37,159
what used to be closed internal systems

174
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,380
they were attaching them to the internet

175
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,419
and they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know how to secure it</font>

176
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,310
and of course the industry was born

177
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,530
where you know first he had to go out

178
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">and do assessments and scanning tools</font>

179
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,960
became available firewalls were

180
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:54,080
available to protect the perimeter and

181
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:56,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sorry yeah I mean all sorts of stuff</font>

182
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,430
was going on but it all started with it

183
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:00,469
all started then with you've got things

184
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,270
in place already let's do a pen test but

185
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,700
really when I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to my customers</font>

186
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,530
and ask them what do you want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

187
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,599
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pen test and then I don't know I</font>

188
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:11,299
just know we need a pen test and I'd say

189
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,550
well do you want us to find a way into

190
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,260
your network or do you want us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

191
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,720
all the ways we can get into your

192
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,099
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> invariably they said well we</font>

193
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,930
want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find all the holes we want</font>

194
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,250
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to plug everything you know discover</font>

195
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,479
everything I said okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

196
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,419
pen test that's a vulnerability

197
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:27,169
assessment so really pen testing what I

198
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:28,549
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> prime</font>

199
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:31,128
early in the early days was far more

200
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,599
often a vulnerability assessment there

201
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:34,729
were times<font color="#E5E5E5"> where there was exceptions</font>

202
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,110
but most people wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

203
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:38,089
everything that was wrong that's a

204
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,120
vulnerability assessment I go away for

205
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:46,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years I come back we're still talking</font>

206
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">about vulnerability assessment so you</font>

207
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,699
know again there's no necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

208
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,899
or wrong answers<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's what do you want</font>

209
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:52,550
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the pen test you know</font>

210
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:54,380
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goal of the pen test back in</font>

211
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:58,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day when I was doing it many years</font>

212
00:08:54,380 --> 00:09:00,649
ago the goal was to get root nowadays

213
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,630
it's more administrative access but I

214
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:04,970
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing mostly unix based networks</font>

215
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,920
back then so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would we had</font>

216
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,199
our little fun stuff we did you know we

217
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">got the root dance and we had all sorts</font>

218
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:14,019
of little stupid things we did

219
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:17,389
high-fiving each other when we got root

220
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:18,980
sometimes the the objective was<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you</font>

221
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:21,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">get here can you get to a particular</font>

222
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:24,709
system can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get to a particular data</font>

223
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:28,820
set or database we had an executive at

224
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:30,649
NSA put a file in one of his directories

225
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,600
in one of his folders and the objective

226
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:34,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can you get to this file and of</font>

227
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,560
course we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to it and we added a</font>

228
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,510
message to in<font color="#E5E5E5"> response to the message</font>

229
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:43,250
that he'd written in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this little text</font>

230
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:47,990
file you know is it discovery is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

231
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:50,449
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear this a lot talking to</font>

232
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,010
customers we don't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we don't</font>

233
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:54,199
store that data you know are you

234
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">capturing sensitive like social security</font>

235
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:57,290
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> or in the credit card</font>

236
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:59,779
industry are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> capturing and storing</font>

237
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:02,269
the sensitive authentication data the

238
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:03,709
three or four digits oh no no we don't

239
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,449
capture that well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're accepting it</font>

240
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:07,729
here on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> website yeah yeah but we</font>

241
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:10,490
don't store it well inevitably when when

242
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:13,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">customers said we don't do that our job</font>

243
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:16,300
was to discover oh yeah you do and yes

244
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:18,560
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> an educational exercise perhaps</font>

245
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:22,040
lots of different reasons and they're

246
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,319
all legitimate really if you just go

247
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,889
into the pen test with this is what we

248
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:29,870
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the pen test one of</font>

249
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:33,470
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've also seen in the gap</font>

250
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:37,600
over the years is sort of anybody know

251
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,600
what that is reference Kobayashi Maru

252
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:49,170
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> movie reference from Star Trek</font>

253
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,330
which one come on shout it out we don't

254
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:54,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">have time its star trek</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the original</font>

255
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">series the Wrath of Khan the the spoiler</font>

256
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,410
alert if you've not seen the movie one

257
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,960
of the themes of going through the movie

258
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:03,030
is Captain Kirk is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only cadet at</font>

259
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,610
Starfleet Academy that ever defeated

260
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:08,069
this unbeatable test which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

261
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,830
the Kobayashi Maru the point of the test

262
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:13,380
was to see how a cadet would react in an

263
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:17,160
unwinnable situation so it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

264
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:19,920
of a holodeck you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> roleplay there on</font>

265
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,810
the bridge and they're being overrun by

266
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,670
Klingons and the ship's about to be

267
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,680
destroyed all lives are going to be lost

268
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,839
how do you handle that that's the point

269
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,670
of the exercise Captain Kirk was the

270
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,560
only one<font color="#E5E5E5"> who'd ever defeated it and it</font>

271
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,819
turns out at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the movie what</font>

272
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,650
he did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> he hacked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

273
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">application and changed it so that there</font>

274
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:39,689
was an outcome where he could win boy

275
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,130
you know that's what you know pentesting

276
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,750
in the early days you know people got

277
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,580
good at the firewalls and the perimeter

278
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,410
protections and we started talking about

279
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,380
but what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're an insider where can</font>

280
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,819
you go from<font color="#E5E5E5"> here social</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> engineering came</font>

281
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,070
about well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what if people are</font>

282
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,200
breaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> in what are people are sending</font>

283
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:58,020
you phishing messages we've learned a

284
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,390
lot about that this morning so<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime a</font>

285
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:05,130
defense goes up you figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new way</font>

286
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:07,830
to you know side sidestep and get in so

287
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:11,070
is that legitimate or is that not

288
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:17,130
legitimate these are the questions that

289
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:19,800
I asked so I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was aqsa I I</font>

290
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:24,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">came into this talk a few years ago and</font>

291
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:27,359
my mind mindset is really based on the

292
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:30,540
PCI standard if any of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys ever</font>

293
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,940
seen this before is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this new teeth the</font>

294
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,189
pci data security standard has six

295
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,530
overarching goals which<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would argue or</font>

296
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:39,840
pretty comprehensive technology

298
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,800
major requirements and from there it's

299
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've lost count there's four hundred and</font>

some-odd sub requirements

301
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:56,220
and I did say<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCI so go ahead and insert</font>

302
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:57,930
your your stupid PCI auditor now these

00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,060
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI cut actually these</font>

304

305
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:05,790
the years in the middle there TJX

306
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,790
companies heartland there's other

307
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:10,620
companies up there<font color="#E5E5E5"> they claim their</font>

308
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:13,170
claim to fame is that they were famously

309
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,480
breached in the mid mid to late two

310
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:18,180
thousand so the team that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was involved</font>

311
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,250
with was responsible for going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a</font>

lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these breached company companies</font>

313
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,930
in the in the mid to late 2000s and and

314
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:28,079
do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cleanup</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and get them really on</font>

315
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:34,920
board with PCI and security so not the

316

data security standard in version 3

319
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,400
introduced detail into what a pen test

320
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,430
is supposed to be PCI is always required

321
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:53,699
pen testing since the very beginnings of

322
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:55,680
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard 12 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago but they never</font>

323
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,780
really defined what it was I looked at a

324
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,939
lot of pen test results as my in my role

325
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,860
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> aqsa over the years you have to do it</font>

326
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,840
inside you have to do it outside but

327
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,360
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really never any definition of</font>

328
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,610
what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was supposed to be any</font>

329
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,740
definition of should it be automated or

330
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,550
manual or some combination you know what

331
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:16,620
is it exactly so finally pci came out

332
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:18,150
with a document that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of put it in</font>

333
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,550
detail and then they put it into the

334
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:23,400
standard this is what's supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

335
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:25,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a pen test and it starts with have a</font>

00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:29,910
documented methodology what a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

337
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:31,710
have a set of ground rules and and you

338
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,990
can read<font color="#E5E5E5"> through that it's it's pretty</font>

339
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:36,210
comprehensive inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside what does</font>

340
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,670
that mean and oh not just inside outside

341
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:40,050
your network but inside outside what's

342
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:43,530
known as the card data environment

343
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,819
you're more sensitive systems do it at

344
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:51,030
the network level do it at the

345
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:53,500
application layer great<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea they have</font>

346
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:57,550
this nice definition of the pen

347
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:59,950
test and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time to let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

348
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:03,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">read it all let me paraphrase it's</font>

349
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:05,440
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good and it says and this is</font>

350
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:08,710
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that PCI is famous for they</font>

351
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,830
get down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to really what constitutes a</font>

352
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:13,390
pen test is exploitation or attempted

353
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,340
exploitation of discovered

354
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:17,590
vulnerabilities risks holes bugs

355
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:20,740
whatever you want to call it where they

356
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:23,560
failed in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion is they they say it</font>

357
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:25,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">should be a manual process but they</font>

358
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,699
didn't say it must be a manual process

359
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:30,400
the pen testers that I used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work with</font>

360
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,590
we kind of prided ourselves on it being

361
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,270
a manual process and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

362
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,850
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen testing community a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

363
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:38,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">eds curtis's and the big names they all</font>

364
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:42,510
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really should be manual</font>

365
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:45,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's got to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you against the world not</font>

366
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:47,380
where they call puppy mill automated

367
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,550
tools and things like that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

368
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,380
allowed it because there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

369
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,810
companies in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCI world that are</font>

370
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:57,040
selling<font color="#E5E5E5"> automated pen test tools that</font>

371
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:59,339
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> use to to meet the requirement</font>

372
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,980
so the operative thing here is

373
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:05,770
exploitation the gap is between manual

374
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:08,710
automated that's my paraphrase but

375
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:11,170
here's here's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> really got to me in</font>

376
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,970
the world of PCI where companies are

377
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,800
supposed to be basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> implementing a</font>

378
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,660
comprehensive security program and

379
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,449
they're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed they're supposed to</font>

380
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,420
be it's sort of linear building secure

381
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:23,410
systems building<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure networks</font>

382
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,729
maintaining and keeping them secure

383
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,530
having endpoint protection in place

384
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,120
having monitoring in place having

385
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,860
logging in place having intrusion

386
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,330
detection in place having a

00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,950
vulnerability management program in

388
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:36,150
place it's patching systems on a regular

389
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:40,030
basis as critical patches are coming out

390
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:41,800
you know responding to<font color="#E5E5E5"> events revisiting</font>

391
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,900
everything as new things are discovered

392
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,400
doing vulnerability scanning you know

393
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,860
the scanning tools that are out there

394
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,510
are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stay up to date</font>

395
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,339
with all the latest greatest bugs and

vulnerabilities and<font color="#E5E5E5"> miss configurations</font>

397
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:56,410
that are out there and if you're

398
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:59,220
supposed to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing all of that do why</font>

399
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,219
do you need a pen test

400
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:13,480
any initial response to that so let that

401
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">question simmer for a minute the things</font>

402
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:19,270
that I saw most<font color="#E5E5E5"> often especially in my</font>

403
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:21,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">PC I days of why people wanted to do the</font>

404
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:25,480
pen test first and foremost was to meet

405
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:27,819
the compliance requirement again most

406
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,890
companies wanted to treat the pen test

407
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:33,879
as a vulnerability assessment find all

408
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:36,640
the problems we did in our days of pen

409
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:40,299
testing when I used to do it we started

410
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,299
dabbling into the testing of the the

411
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:46,360
defense mechanisms especially when IDs

412
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:48,760
was first coming out you know it became

413
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,918
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a cat and mouse key you know if</font>

414
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,200
you do a certain amount of activity do

415
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:56,380
the detection mechanisms trigger an

416
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,720
alert and you're caught<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we used</font>

417
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come in stealthy and gradually sort</font>

418
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,860
of turn up the volume unfortunately back

419
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,900
in those days and I don't know if it's

420
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,080
changed a whole lot we'd kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

421
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">would kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spin the volume to 11 and</font>

422
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:14,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">still nothing would happen they still</font>

423
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:16,809
didn't detectives<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what we tried to</font>

424
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,669
do with our pen testing results was

425
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:21,120
tried to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it turn the results the</font>

reports into learning opportunities hey

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,459
here's things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are wrong with your</font>

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:45,220
in my opinion and this is where I'm

436
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:47,740
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little soapbox</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> e I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

437
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,870
felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you know pen testing has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

438
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:52,480
around for like 25 years give or take

439
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:54,100
some could argue longer but you know you

440
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,200
know as<font color="#E5E5E5"> long as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> systems have</font>

441
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,870
been around there's been some concept of

442
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,870
penetration testing and what was nagging

443
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:04,300
at me is again if if people are doing

444
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:06,070
all the right things from a security

445
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:11,620
perspective from the building a program

446
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:14,260
perspective why still pen test

447
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,729
especially pen tests and I I think I've

448
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,960
seen it enough in the last couple years

449
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,760
that I've been coming to these hacker

450
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,190
conferences listening to a lot of talks

451
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,470
about pen testing there's still<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

452
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,540
pen testing that's done in my opinion

453
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,730
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> purposes of vulnerability</font>

454
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:30,370
assessment like this whole thing called

455
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:32,980
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do starts with a pen</font>

456
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:35,530
test starts with discovery and while I

457
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:39,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">think discovery is legitimate and pen</font>

458
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:40,809
testing is fun I wonder about the

459
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,490
especially if I'm doing it as a

460
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:44,559
consultant or a third party for a

461
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:46,750
customer you know is it really the most

462
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost-effective way to educate and aware</font>

463
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,550
and find problems and find find issues

464
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:56,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">and goals and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> misconfigurations and</font>

465
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:58,090
things like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> where my head is is</font>

466
00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:00,040
that you know penetration testing in

467
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:02,409
terms of what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and what you're</font>

468
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:06,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing in terms of the goals should start</font>

469
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:08,110
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> more focused on not</font>

470
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,210
vulnerabilities because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

471
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:13,300
supposedly got mechanisms in place to

472
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:15,790
find and discover and keep keep your

473
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,800
arms around vulnerabilities and by the

474
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,030
way they're pervasive and ongoing and

475
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,460
they're always going to be more more

476
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:23,200
vulnerabilities but maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentesting</font>

477
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,860
should really start to focus more on the

478
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,290
threats it was talked about a little bit

479
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,580
you know a specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of threat or</font>

480
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:32,740
threat agent was discussed in the

481
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,928
keynote this morning but yeah how do you

482
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect against phishing if that's a</font>

483
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:41,980
common way for the bad guys and the

484
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:43,630
attackers to compromise networks there's

485
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,340
more automated attacks that are out

486
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:47,890
there today when when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I first started</font>

487
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">out it was people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to break into</font>

488
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:52,970
systems and

489
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:54,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">you actually breaking in getting through</font>

490
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:57,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">the firewall getting into the internal</font>

491
00:20:54,830 --> 00:21:00,678
network and what the hell is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internal</font>

492
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,809
network these days but the you know so

493
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:05,169
the technology's changed the landscape

494
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:07,220
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed the fundamentals the the</font>

495
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:10,100
philosophies I don't think have changed

496
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,960
a whole lot there's bad guys and I think

497
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,850
I left his talk early I don't know how

498
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,470
much he went into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but there's bad</font>

499
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,330
guys there's threat agents that may or

500
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">may not want to do something to you your</font>

501
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:21,289
company who you're working for your

502
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:23,178
customer it's good to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take time to</font>

503
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:25,639
figure out who that might be and what

504
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:27,470
their motivation might be take a step

505
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:29,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">outside of the technical realm of</font>

506
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:33,409
everything he was touching on that a

507
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:36,259
little bit but here's where I was at my

508
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:37,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ideal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pentest yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

509

a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> solid methodology you know what</font>

510
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:44,179
your goals are all parties agree this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

511
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,369
the objective of the pen test but and

512
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:47,899
again with my thinking that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

513
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:49,820
customer this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is somebody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help become more secure and to</font>

515
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,320
protect whatever it is they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

516
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:58,119
protect at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day when the</font>

517
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:01,309
pen test is performed I get no results

518
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:07,459
it's a fail that to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me is the ideal pen</font>

519
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:09,580
test because the company is secure or my

520
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,110
attempts the pen testing attempts are

521
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:14,210
detected and detected early and blocked

522
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,549
or at least you know the red flags go

523
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:19,399
off the alarms go off and there's a

524
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:21,918
response that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me is a perfect 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> till</font>

525
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:24,350
pentas not one that finds more

that works for pen test company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he</font>

530
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:35,720
had gone through a bunch of their

531
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,580
customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just did a survey of how</font>

532
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,860
did we break in how did we get access

533
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:43,418
having access global domain access and

534
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:47,449
he categorized it in the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> five ways</font>

535
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:49,610
was exploitation of trust relationships

passwords password a week shared

passwords common passwords some

538

variation of passwords and basically

00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:58,428
lack of segmentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> a flat network you</font>

540

00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:01,820
like

542
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:04,620
that's what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> f it was 25</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font>

543
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:07,290
why are we still<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing pen test finding</font>

544
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,790
that stuff when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to do pen tests</font>

545
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:11,490
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found something like a default</font>

546
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:13,230
faster password we'd stop the exercise

547
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,330
and say we don't need to be pen testing

548
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:17,970
you we need to we need to spend your

549
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:19,530
money educating I had a customer one

550
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,450
time that they had they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

551
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:24,210
installed a firewall as a brand new

00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,680
firewall top-of-the-line firewall<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font>

553
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:28,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">some years ago he probably never heard</font>

554
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,300
of the product they've gone through all

555
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,790
the training classes they got their

556
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,260
servant certificates they set it up this

557
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:37,649
is back in the days when firewall rule

558
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:41,820
sets were like 25-30 rules so it's

559
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:44,790
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> basic the idea of the DMZ was</font>

560
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:47,429
actually you had actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network segments</font>

561
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:49,770
that were sort of linear not multihomed

562
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:52,200
like they are today not all in a virtual

563
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,940
device like they are today well we

564
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,910
started poking him from the outside and

565
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,370
was like there's no firewall there and

566
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:01,530
we went inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we would start on the</font>

567
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,939
outside go on the inside and while we

568
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:04,770
were on the inside they started getting

569
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,300
dose of course we were the ones blamed

570
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,280
so we said timeout let's look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

571
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,750
firewall rules well we're looking at

572
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:14,700
their very short list of firewall rules

573
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:16,410
and the final rule was any any allow so

574
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,510
I said timeout we're done we're not

575
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing a pen test anymore we're gonna</font>

576
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:22,020
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> teach you guys how to</font>

577
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:25,290
architecture network and set up firewall

578
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:27,150
rules that actually work and and that

579
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:29,010
was a seminal moment for me in my career

580
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:31,590
because when we presented this to the

581
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:35,160
customer I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say it was their CFO</font>

582
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:36,959
he's like wow that's the smartest

583
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,610
engagement I've ever seen because

584
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,710
usually when we hire people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a job</font>

585
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:43,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">they just do the job and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take the money</font>

586
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:46,380
and you know what you paid for us to do

587
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:48,360
it so that's sort of that that helped to

588
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,010
mold my career in my attitude that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

589
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,110
should always help the customer do the

590
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:57,360
right thing regardless of what the

591
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:59,370
contracts is so anyway I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

592
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,530
we're not there yet as an industry

593
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:04,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">pentesting still comes up way too much</font>

594
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:06,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">in terms of vulnerability discovery and</font>

595
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:09,360
while I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> pen testing is important</font>

596
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:12,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">and legitimate I think it's a safety net</font>

597
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,469
exercise it's a live-fire exercise

598
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,360
that you do after you've done all the

599
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you think you can do to</font>

600
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:22,959
protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network they're really it's</font>

601
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:24,730
much more threat based<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's being</font>

602
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,440
creative you know what if we do have an

603
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:28,120
insider what if we've pissed off

604
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,740
somebody in development or what if we

605
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,840
pissed<font color="#E5E5E5"> off pissed off somebody in</font>

606
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:36,280
accounting what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we hire third party</font>

607
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,199
cleaning crews are coming over night you

608
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,910
know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and it's legitimate to</font>

609
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">test all these different scenarios</font>

610
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:45,159
hopefully because you've already<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone</font>

611
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:48,370
through the exercise of what are the bad

612
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:50,200
guys who are the bad guys why would they

613
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">come after us what would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they be trying</font>

00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:00,159
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more logic perhaps and more</font>

00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,860

624
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:20,649
that up as a vulnerability because to me

625

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the finding is not i found a</font>

00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,780
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> something wrong with your</font>

00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:40,870
doing all the things one time we<font color="#CCCCCC"> did a</font>

634
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,789
pen test where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were hired to just</font>

635
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:45,428
look at the firewall single interface

636
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:47,080
single IP address we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> hired to just</font>

637
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:49,480
can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> break in through the firewall</font>

638
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:53,049
and while we were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing sort of</font>

639
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,240
scanning of their environment we saw web

640
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:57,039
servers and they were not part of the

641
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,630
scope<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our engagement but we poked</font>

642
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,549
enough to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> these look like default</font>

643
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:04,480
insults this is back in probably windows

644
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:07,179
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> T days and out of the box systems</font>

645
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,120
internet-facing probably we're talking

646
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:12,640
inside as well as outside and we didn't

647
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,918
touch him we didn't go beyond the

648
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,659
contract of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bank or an insurance</font>

649
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:17,270
company that would have sued us if we

650
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:19,670
went beyond

651
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:21,530
but when we reported our findings we

652
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:23,450
said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know your firewall is great but</font>

653
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,100
there's a stuff over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

654
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:28,160
pretty sure we could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to get in</font>

655
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:30,080
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and break</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into your network another</font>

656
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,340
seminal moment in my career the whoever

657
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">we were presenting to at that point</font>

658
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">turned to his people and said what's</font>

659
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,860
wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> with our processes that were</font>

660
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,390
allowing our people to put these boxes

661
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">out on the internet and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was like wow</font>

662
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:44,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's exactly the right question to ask</font>

663
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:45,980
what's wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> with our processes you</font>

664
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:49,130
mentioned somebody mentioned risk

665
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:51,500
earlier we don't teach the risk equation

666
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:53,270
anymore everything in this industry is

667
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,730
focused on vulnerabilities but guess

668
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:57,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">what vulnerability is just a portion of</font>

669
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:01,280
an equation that evaluates risk and

670
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:03,200
there's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10,000 mathematical</font>

671
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,660
equations out there to attempt to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

672
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,160
put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of value to risk to me it's</font>

673
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,040
got to be higher level and more

674
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,900
intuitive and I've always<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried to break</font>

675
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,000
it down to simple math you know there's

676
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:16,250
and this is what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned in my DoD</font>

677
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,800
days you have vulnerabilities you have

678
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:20,540
threats there's the things it's a Jew to

679
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,419
protect against the vulnerabilities and

680
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:25,700
the threats that is somehow reducing

681
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,950
whatever this value is but there's this

682
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,050
overarching multiplier especially in

683
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:32,750
terms of the commercial world not so

684
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:35,180
much in terms of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DoD of the value of</font>

685
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:36,710
what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to protect what</font>

686
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,990
it is you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to protect might be</font>

687
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:41,630
sensitive data it might be financial

688
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:44,060
data it might be consumer data it might

689
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:46,070
be your rep you corporate reputation how

690
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:49,550
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put a dollar value on that how do</font>

691
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:50,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> define but define what the risk is</font>

692
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:52,940
and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much you invest against</font>

693
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:57,590
protecting it against the bad things

694
00:28:52,940 --> 00:29:02,060
happening I'm sorry especially if it's

695
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:03,980
qualitative and you know I would talk to

696
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">many customers over the years especially</font>

697
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,310
in the early days you know what do you

698
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,080
not want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen well we don't want to</font>

699
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:11,360

705
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,760
protect against it I mean the story that

706
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">I that I will tell hopefully as shmoocon</font>

is about one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

708
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:29,480
early forensics exercises that we did

00:29:26,989 --> 00:29:31,549
for a customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that had to do with just</font>

710
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,019
their website being defaced I mean who

00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:34,399
cares<font color="#E5E5E5"> about their website being</font>

two-faced well large companies

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,479
especially in the early days<font color="#CCCCCC"> it cared</font>

00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:41,330
about corporate reputation and what what

how might this impact our value our

corporate image our customer and you

last<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple months because I've gone out</font>

723
00:29:57,739 --> 00:30:02,269
to conferences and trade shows ins and

724
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:04,580
I've seen companies that advertise we're

725
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:08,570
experts on threat I'm like what's a

726
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:11,059
threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> no what's a risk and like no it's</font>

727
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:14,450
not it's part of an equation that leads

728
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:15,950
you to what risk is so we need to learn

729
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,869
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> these terms are and what they mean</font>

730
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you don't have to agree on an exact</font>

731
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:22,488
absolute value but for the love of God

732
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:24,080
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand have some</font>

733
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:25,460
understanding of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interplay and how</font>

734
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,739
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are component parts of this</font>

735
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,389
overall nebulous thing that we call risk

736
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:31,159
frankly we're in the brisk business

737
00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:35,689
we're not in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security business I</font>

738
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:37,489
mean that's my bottom line you know how

739
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:39,499
do you do this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of bleeds</font>

740
00:30:37,489 --> 00:30:41,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">into some of the other talks that I that</font>

741
00:30:39,499 --> 00:30:42,889
I've given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are out there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

742
00:30:41,389 --> 00:30:44,330
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to become educators we're the</font>

743
00:30:42,889 --> 00:30:45,949
ones that know what's bad and know

744
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:48,168
what's wrong so we need to figure out

745
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:51,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to convey and communicate that to</font>

746
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:53,450
people I've heard referred to as muggles

747
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:56,869
or the stupid people or the real<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

748
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:58,429
or the ordinary people<font color="#E5E5E5"> which implies we</font>

749
00:30:56,869 --> 00:30:59,779
need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> humble and stop calling the</font>

750
00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:02,119
people that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to convince to</font>

751
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:06,470
do things differently implying that

752
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:10,459
they're stupid I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go on and on about</font>

753
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:12,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">this but as a consultant to me it's all</font>

754
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:15,470
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> communication and it's really</font>

755
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:17,330
perfect persuasive speech you're trying

756
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:19,850
to convince somebody to change behavior

757
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:22,789
spend money do something differently

758
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:24,408
invest in different things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

759
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:26,840
most of the commercial world just wants

760
00:31:24,409 --> 00:31:28,519
to buy technology drop in some new

761
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,709
product and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do everything</font>

762
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,389
for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I don't have to think I mean</font>

763
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:34,489
that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the that's really what</font>

764
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:36,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're up against a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of times we've</font>

765
00:31:34,489 --> 00:31:38,740
only got<font color="#CCCCCC"> about five minutes</font>

766
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:41,050
any questions comments pushback feedback

767
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:59,350
agree with me disagree with me it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

768
00:31:41,050 --> 00:32:01,629
yes sir mm-hmm yes so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this goes</font>

769
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:04,500
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what is a pen test you know a</font>

770
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:06,730
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the research community</font>

771
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,490
vulnerability research community bug

772
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:11,530
bounty security research community

773
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:13,390
there's all legitimate reasons for

774
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:14,649
trying to find vulnerabilities and bugs

775
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,900
and things that are wrong with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

776
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:19,360
technologies that we use I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

777
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that's a pen test we call it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pen</font>

778
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,320
test we kind of lump it all together but

779
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:25,120
to meet security research and

780
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,820
vulnerability discovery is a different

781
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,320
exercise than pen testing that makes

782
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:36,310
sense yes what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your thoughts on the</font>

783
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:38,800
execution standard I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> read it you</font>

784
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:41,909
guys I mean the company's I start

785
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:46,389
accepting it or I mean that we built our

786
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:48,250
company methodology I have that

787
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:52,180
referenced in there somewhere but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

788
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:53,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't looked at it in a while what I</font>

789
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,840
think isn't actually I think it's

790
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:58,330
referenced in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the PCI</font>

791
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,120
documentation or or maybe embedded<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bush</font>

792
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:04,030
will be what's the you know truly the

793
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,969
benefit<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a methodology in a pen test</font>

794
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:09,790
and the importance of that versus so

795
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:11,500
yeah I guess depending on what

796
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:13,270
methodology you're following or what

797
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,950
industry accepted methodology you're

798
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:17,560
following I think the importance of

799
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:19,360
following a methodology is understanding

800
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,510
what the goals<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what the outcomes are</font>

801
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,560
I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to ask my customers okay</font>

802
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:25,330
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do this exercise</font>

803
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,490
whatever it is we're going to produce a

804
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,840
report what are you hoping to get out of

805
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:31,200
it you know what it you know who's the

806
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,879
consumer what are they looking for

807
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,640
especially in the PCI world I you know

808
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,500
you might imagine as a qsa I sometimes

809
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,960
went into hostile environments because I

810
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,790
was just a stupid auditor I happen to

811
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,280
know a little bit about security so

812
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:47,020
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to kind of win when the</font>

813
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,580
technical people over that I had to talk

814
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,620
to

815
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,419
and one of the ways i did that is look

816
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:54,270
you guys understand your network far

817
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:57,120
better that I do and I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

818
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:59,580
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you need I'm your best friend</font>

819
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,679
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now because if we can slap pci on</font>

820
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:05,340
it guess what you're going to get it and

821
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:07,410
lo and behold they would and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i won many</font>

822
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:11,100
friends and again that's part of the

823
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:13,080
trust relationship yeah all right we got

824
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:16,880
to wrap it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up sorry guys that we got</font>

825
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">impressed thank you</font>
