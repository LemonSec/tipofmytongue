00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:23,360
hi I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian roads and I'll talk to</font>

2
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:26,540
you today about getting kids and

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,810
students interested in infosec this also

4
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,460
goes towards people that are canna in

5
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:34,309
the industry or have done<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer work</font>

6
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,020
in the past and<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to break into the</font>

7
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:42,190
computer security field so it's kind of

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:44,930
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for everybody I am Brian roads</font>

9
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,089
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'll probably cover that again</font>

10
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,769
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide as well so I'm going to</font>

11
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,460
talk about emphasize careers what are

12
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:54,920
they in general and how to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into them</font>

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:58,520
how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go from a student level</font>

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,829
where you're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning and to gain</font>

15
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,230
more experience and what you can do as

16
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:05,630
far as he TS and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> cts can help you</font>

17
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,910
build those skills and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

18
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,740
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some cyber</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> defense competitions</font>

19
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:12,830
that are both<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the high school and</font>

20
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:15,550
college level and the palmetto cyber

21
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:21,200
defense competition that we host locally

22
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:24,100
here in Charleston I am a red team

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,130
operator and pen tester in my day job

24
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,919
I've also been part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the PCB see gold</font>

25
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:34,369
Team and Red Team so I've helped build

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,110
the network as well as Tara down I've

27
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:38,869
also participated in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the southeast</font>

28
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:42,229
regional and national CCDC competitions

29
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:44,690
and was part of the team that won

30
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:51,110
besides<font color="#CCCCCC"> charlson here last year for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

31
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:55,039
CTF and my co-presenter will be Tilson

32
00:01:51,110 --> 00:02:03,320
Galloway and his team actually just won

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:05,900
the 2016 CTF so what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec it's</font>

34
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:10,459
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> giant conglomeration of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all these</font>

35
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:12,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">different diverse fields of expertise</font>

36
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:14,420
right so you have system administrators

37
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,590
you have forensic people you have

38
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:21,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network Analyst you have legal people</font>

39
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:24,569
you have policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> people it's kind of</font>

40
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:31,159
everything right so how do you

41
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:35,700
from no experience into learning about

42
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:37,888
these jobs right so hacks for pancakes

43
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,069
put out a great megamix article about

44
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:45,269
how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get started in infosec she breaks</font>

45
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:48,719
down Blue Team and Red Team or defensive

46
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:50,849
and offensive job descriptions and what

47
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:55,680
skills<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be successful in each</font>

48
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:59,388
of those as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see here it's pretty</font>

49
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:04,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the spectrum of technologies right</font>

50
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:05,669
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> opt-ins</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things you have the</font>

51
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,980
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I do which is penetration</font>

52
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:09,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">testing you also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have physical</font>

53
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,209
penetration testers and those are people

54
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">that actually try to like jump the fence</font>

55
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,730
or break you know pick locks and stuff

56
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:18,780
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get into buildings</font>

57
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,909
vulnerability researchers exploit

58
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,030
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that need a lot of</font>

59
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:29,060
reverse engineering skills bug bounties

60
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:32,120
have become popular as they've been more

61
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,889
better funded over the last couple years

62
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,799
and a lot of these blue team jobs are

63
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:39,419
ones that have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for decades</font>

64
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,599
just maybe under different names right

65
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:44,180
so sometimes you know a decade<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

66
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,379
somebody that was a system administrator

67
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,750
was responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

68
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:51,448
positions to some degree or another so

69
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:56,220
now they've become slightly more

70
00:03:51,449 --> 00:04:00,000
specialized but the the tools and

71
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:05,280
techniques<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they use are all pretty</font>

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,379
much the same right so how do you break

73
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,229
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec you have to start somewhere</font>

74
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:12,899
and then you're an infosec before you

75
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:15,299
know what you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done your kind of</font>

76
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,099
already there but you you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

77
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:22,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">somewhere and build some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very basic</font>

78
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:23,789
skills and experience because even as a

79
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,370
penetration tester you first<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

80
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:28,590
know how to edit administer systems

81
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,750
right like once I'm able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get onto a</font>

82
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:34,280
box I have to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what to do when I get</font>

83
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:36,330
there so how do we gain these skills

84
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,210
there's traditional methods like

85
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:42,630
classrooms and conferences like we're at

86
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:45,659
now which are great but a lot of the

87
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:48,960
stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll be doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

88
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:52,169
learn on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own and for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font>

89
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet it's not just for porn and</font>

90
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:56,580
Facebook anymore so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a wealth of</font>

91
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,759
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of these</font>

92
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:02,300
different jobs and skill<font color="#CCCCCC"> sets you just</font>

93
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:07,590
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where to find the resources</font>

94
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:10,860
to use them so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> a high schooler</font>

95
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:13,739
looking to learn these new skills the

96
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">best option is to practice practice</font>

97
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,349
practice practice right practice makes

98
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:22,020
perfect there's a whole number about

99
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:25,800
10,000 hours makes you an expert in

100
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:28,889
something but you can also do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

101
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,180
thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10,000 hours and never get any</font>

102
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:34,310
better at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're never</font>

103
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:36,539
challenging yourself to improve right so

104
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,979
the best thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do is find</font>

105
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:40,860
something that's engaging and

106
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:44,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">entertaining usually to keep you on the</font>

107
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,419
right path and something challenging to

108
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,059
make it harder so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

109
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:50,549
continuously learning new things so you

110
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,000
can do this in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple different ways</font>

111
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:58,530
you can build a lab at home you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,870
social engagement such as going finding

113
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:04,380
your favorite people<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Twitter and</font>

114
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:09,500
following them there's some great

115
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:12,900
information about new exploits or new

116
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,240
forensic techniques or new threat actors

117
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,638
that people are constantly releasing

118
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,919
into their Twitter feeds and then

119
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,710
generating blog posts and publishing

120
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,419
reports so it's very important to say up

121
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">to date with the latest techniques and</font>

122
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:29,520
stuff like that other options or

123
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,590
conferences obviously I'm speaking to

124
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,289
the choir here since you're all at a

125
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:36,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">b-sides conference but there are great</font>

126
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:39,300
ways to interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people in</font>

127
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:42,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">your field and meet new colleagues and</font>

128
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,029
meet new friends and perhaps find a

129
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,710
mentor right if you can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

130
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:49,140
that is doing and

131
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:52,169
arresting work in your field follow

132
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:54,229
their work and do some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own and</font>

133
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:58,290
maybe see if they can help you as well

134
00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:00,690
once you become more knowledgeable in

135
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:03,330
that field you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a position to take</font>

136
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:11,010
other new people under your<font color="#E5E5E5"> wing to help</font>

137
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:13,260
them as they're learning right so let's

138
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,340
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this deliberate practice the</font>

139
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,320
first thing you want to do is set very

140
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,169
clear goals for yourself what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

141
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,120
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to accomplish you can say I want</font>

142
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be a great pen tester or I want to be</font>

143
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,360
a great forensics guy but that's very

144
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:30,210
generic and very general so you need to

145
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,570
set clear goals for yourself and break

146
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:36,330
it down into sub skills such as I want

147
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:38,159
to know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do memory analysis I want</font>

148
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be able to recover files from a file</font>

149
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,200
system I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about the specific</font>

150
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:46,140
policies or techniques to ensure that

151
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:50,039
I'm getting clean images of a recovered

152
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,630
drive right pretty much everything can

153
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,800
be broken down into smaller and smaller

154
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:59,540
pieces that are a lot easier to master

155
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:03,930
individually than trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to accomplish a</font>

156
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:05,730
generic goal as a whole it's very

157
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:09,180
important to track your progress to see

158
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:11,040
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going and what you're both what</font>

159
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:15,000
you have done and what you have left to

160
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,530
do right and feedback loops to make sure

161
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,450
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're on the right track to make</font>

162
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:22,950
sure you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the correct things and</font>

163
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,570
accountability is where other people

164
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:27,390
hold you accountable for the work that

165
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:32,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">you are doing so maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you come and</font>

166
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:35,370
present at a b-sides conference and you

167
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,350
know let people mock you so code Academy

168
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,890
and code wars are good examples of

169
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:42,930
deliberate practice it's you can say I

170
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:45,540
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to become a better Python</font>

171
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:47,699
programmer it's a very generic topic

172
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:51,569
right so how do you do that you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

173
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:53,970
somewhere like Codecademy and it has

174
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,329
step-by-step lessons<font color="#CCCCCC"> that teach you how</font>

175
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:59,070
to do python programming

176
00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:02,550
this helps build sub skills such as

177
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:05,610
mastery of you know sockets reading and

178
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:09,359
writing files manipulating data and

179
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,949
structures it lets you track progress to

180
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,680
see what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you have</font>

181
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:15,839
left to do then you start getting into

182
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">feedback loops with websites like code</font>

183
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">Wars where they present challenges to</font>

184
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:23,490
you and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you complete the</font>

185
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:28,319
challenge and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see how other</font>

186
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:30,480
programmers<font color="#E5E5E5"> tackle the same problems so</font>

187
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:33,569
you get to compare your code<font color="#CCCCCC"> to theirs</font>

188
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,509
and your solution gets posted online as

189
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:42,860
well so other people can comment on your

190
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:46,230
code so this forces you into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> habit of</font>

191
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:50,630
both learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> new skills and reinforcing</font>

192
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,630
the skills that as you're learning them

193
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,660
for building a lab this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of an</font>

old image from a rapid<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven document</font>

195
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,160
but it kind of speaks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point that</font>

196
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:06,089
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get at is it's very easy to</font>

197
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,860
build labs these days there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment</font>

198
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:09,930
that you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this very cheap or you</font>

199
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,500
can do pretty much everything virtually

200
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:16,199
these days this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one example this</font>

201
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">is more for penetration tests example</font>

202
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:21,599
because it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit Oh bull which</font>

versions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux again this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of</font>

209
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,160
for penetration testing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it could be</font>

or a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things for firewalls</font>

224
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:28,280
and networking there's open source stuff

225
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:31,740
like pfsense or free stuff like<font color="#CCCCCC"> pfsense</font>

226
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:34,650
that you can practice your firewall to

and monitor<font color="#CCCCCC"> your traffic with snort or</font>

sericata or a lot of programs like that

229
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:44,189
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy that easy enough so that</font>

230
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,140
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can set it up at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> home and monitor</font>

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own traffic as it's going out to</font>

232
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:51,530
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet and then you can generate</font>

traffic to see how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks on the wire</font>

234
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:56,430
there's other if you're interested in

235
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:59,640
web application stuff there's a project

236
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:04,530
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wasp called web goat it's built</font>

237
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:06,660
as a web penetration testing vm but

238
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,880
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a developer version that</font>

239
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,550
allows you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go in and fix the</font>

240
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,050
vulnerabilities as you find them so you

241
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,609
have both<font color="#E5E5E5"> the knowledge of how to break</font>

242
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:18,240
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the knowledge of how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to patch it</font>

243
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:19,380
so it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both as I</font>

244
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned there's also cheap hardware</font>

245
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:27,570
you can go to goodwill and pick up you

246
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:31,280
know an<font color="#E5E5E5"> old 2900 cisco router and learn</font>

247
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:33,770
to play on iOS right or there's wireless

248
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:38,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">aps if you want to get into wireless</font>

249
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:41,130
technologies for twenty bucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty</font>

250
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:47,150
bucks so the barrier to entry into<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mpho</font>

251
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:47,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">sec has really dropped in recent years</font>

252
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,630
so once we start to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have these skills</font>

253
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:57,440
how do we reinforce them more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and build</font>

254
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:59,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">upon them is by challenging ourselves</font>

255
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,380
particularly with capture the flag

256
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:05,490
competitions there are several types and

257
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,240
we'll kind of go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through these a little</font>

258
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:10,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in detail jeopardy is broken</font>

259
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,690
out in the categories and point values

260
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,959
it's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see a lot of times for</font>

competitions like we had here<font color="#CCCCCC"> besides</font>

Charleston where you attack a box and

00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:34,108
again in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> minute and finally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

288
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:36,659
cyber defense competitions where you act

289
00:14:34,109 --> 00:14:38,369
as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> defender or a protector of the</font>

290
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:41,309
network and you're trying to harden your

291
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:44,159
system as opposed to trying to exploit

292
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:48,269
other ones there's also hybrids<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

293
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:50,339
like sands net wars starts out has five

294
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:53,509
levels and the first two levels are a

then level<font color="#CCCCCC"> five is an attack and defend</font>

303
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:19,409
scenario where you're trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> protect</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">your castle against attackers while</font>

00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:25,579
you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack their servers so</font>

306
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:29,429
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> varieties of these</font>

307
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:32,449
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a quick example of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jeopardy you</font>

308
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:34,449
can see how there are lots of different

309
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:37,479
disciplines

310
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:41,758
in areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> each one is a little different</font>

311
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:45,179
but they normally have some similar main

312
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:49,419
topics like web exploitation reversing

313
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:51,759
and crypto challenges this<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

314
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:56,169
the disciplines needed for infosec right

315
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:59,319
so each of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaks specifically to</font>

316
00:15:56,169 --> 00:16:02,319
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> jobs and different skill sets</font>

317
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:04,748
and it also helps students identify what

318
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:07,269
their passions are right you might be

319
00:16:04,749 --> 00:16:08,889
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in doing web stuff or</font>

320
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:12,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">you might be very interested in doing</font>

321
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:15,669
network stuff or forensic challenges and

322
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:17,709
doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CTS helps you identify the</font>

323
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:20,199
things you really like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and gives</font>

324
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:21,819
you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more focus as to what</font>

325
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:28,209
career opportunities you might want

326
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:31,149
later<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> release a framework</font>

327
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:32,979
for doing CTF challenges this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

328
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:37,929
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as that last</font>

329
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:41,589
slide except much fancier this is also a

330
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:43,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">jeopardy style challenge just broken up</font>

331
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:46,739
into more of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk format where they</font>

332
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:49,388
have countries instead of categories

333
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:50,919
there's a couple other frameworks that

334
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:53,169
have been set up so that you can

335
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:55,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually build your own CTF and host it</font>

336
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:55,589
yourself

337
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,250
that was

338
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:12,970
no not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really that was the intention of</font>

339
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:16,868
it is that they provide the<font color="#E5E5E5"> framework</font>

340
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:22,509
and you provide the challenges and fill

341
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:25,388
it in so you can run your own CTF this

342
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:28,059
is kind of an old slide but it still

343
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:30,248
holds true a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the tools that are</font>

344
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:32,019
used in these CTF challenges are the

345
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:35,049
same tools that are being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used by people</font>

346
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:37,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the industry today right you still</font>

347
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:41,559
have networking people using wireshark

348
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,928
and TCP dump and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> map and telnet you</font>

349
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:47,668
sell reverse engineers using Ida pro and

350
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:51,669
GD v<font color="#CCCCCC"> and r adair same for forensics</font>

351
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:54,220
crypto tools not as much segun ography

352
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:59,350
in the real world as in CTF challenges

353
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:02,109
but that's still in there so by doing

354
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:05,350
the CTS not only do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know more about</font>

355
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:06,789
the the individual fields but you become

356
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">comfortable with the tools that you</font>

357
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:12,908
would then use working in these

358
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:15,899
professions there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple really good</font>

359
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:20,049
starter capture the flag competitions

that's available now but<font color="#CCCCCC"> mitre stem CTF</font>

365
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,619
just ended it's an annual<font color="#E5E5E5"> event but it's</font>

366
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:45,220
also aimed at high schoolers but it's

367
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:48,658
open to anybody that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to play ball</font>

hub is good for the boot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> route</font>

369
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:54,009
challenges that I mentioned a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

370
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:56,799
slides ago where they have a vulnerable

371
00:18:54,009 --> 00:19:00,759
vm that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> download such as web</font>

00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:09,999
got kind of go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through and find flags</font>

375
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:13,119
and try to escalate on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> image each</font>

00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:16,720
year sands<font color="#E5E5E5"> also does a holiday hacking</font>

377
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:19,149
challenge that they put lots and lots of

378
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">time and effort into I believe this year</font>

379
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:24,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">it starts on in december nine</font>

380
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:26,059
and they also leave old versions up on

381
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:30,980
the internet so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to play</font>

382
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:33,440
them from their website finally the link

383
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:36,230
at the bottom to CTF time is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> website</font>

384
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,620
that tracks and monitors CTF events

385
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:41,929
there's a giant calendar if you are

386
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:44,570
super interested in cts there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

387
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:48,049
happening every couple of weekends and

388
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:53,330
random parts of the world and there's

389
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:55,010
there's always something going on next

390
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:57,918
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on cyber defense</font>

391
00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:00,020
competitions right so these are where

392
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,410
you are protecting your network and your

393
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:07,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">computers from attackers cyber</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Patriot</font>

00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:12,290
is was created by the Air Force

395
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:14,179
Association they give you on their

396
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:17,149
website<font color="#CCCCCC"> they give you training materials</font>

397
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:19,549
and practice images that are focused at

398
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:22,730
a high school level but they are a very

399
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:25,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">good foundational material for anybody</font>

400
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:27,559
that's interested in hardening boxes so

401
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:31,100
they have Windows and Linux hardening

402
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:34,129
they have some router documents on there

403
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:36,830
some policy documents on there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

404
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:39,669
great place to start for pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

405
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:43,309
anybody interested in getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> infosec</font>

406
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:47,510
during the actual competition<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was able</font>

00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:50,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see one on yesterday actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went</font>

408
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:52,490
out to one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the high schools that was</font>

409
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,210
going through their first<font color="#E5E5E5"> round of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

410
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:59,480
competition they're given<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMs to</font>

411
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,429
download and at the time allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

412
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,370
start they're given a key to unlock

413
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:06,740
those beams and unencrypted them they

414
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:11,659
were given<font color="#E5E5E5"> one window seven box and one</font>

415
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:13,730
ubuntu workstation they also had a cisco

416
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,110
packet tracer challenge where they had

417
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,870
to build out a networking infrastructure

418
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:19,699
and submitted for scoring there was a

419
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:22,399
networking quiz they had to complete

420
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:26,270
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 to 15 questions of</font>

421
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,630
network questions multiple choice for

422
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:31,309
the most part couple fill in the blanks

423
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:32,480
and on the workstations they also had

424
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:39,590
forensic challenges

425
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:42,500
so they were given a scenario email that

426
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:46,189
basically said you are now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IT person</font>

427
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:48,110
for this company we want you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> harden</font>

428
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,360
these workstations there were a couple

429
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:55,059
task included such as adding user

430
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,059
accounts or they were given a list of

431
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,360
authorized users that should have

432
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,520
accounts on the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the</font>

433
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,159
students were required to try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock</font>

434
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">down those boxes the nice thing about</font>

435
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:10,220
this is they<font color="#E5E5E5"> got immediate feedback so</font>

436
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,760
if it says Harry needs a user account

437
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:16,700
and his username needs to be you know

438
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,010
Harry as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kids go into the</font>

439
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,530
box and add Harry it plays a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

440
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:23,720
noise and it shows up<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

441
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:27,710
added Harry's user account you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

442
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:30,169
points or if you find somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:32,000
user account<font color="#E5E5E5"> list that is not on the</font>

445
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,190
delete<font color="#CCCCCC"> that email a delete the user</font>

446
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:39,530
account it plays in other noise and

447
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,150
gives you five more points so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

448
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:44,990
students know exactly what they're doing

449
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:48,020
right or wrong as the scenario

450
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:51,679
progresses beyond that it's it's

451
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:55,549
somewhat open<font color="#CCCCCC"> it scored out of 100 for</font>

452
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:58,549
each of the two boxes other than doing

453
00:22:55,549 --> 00:23:01,668
user accounts it's fairly generic other

454
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:04,760
than it says things like there should be

455
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:07,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">no unauthorized software or media on the</font>

456
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,650
machines so then the kids have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

457
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:12,709
look through and find out that user Bob

458
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:15,350
downloaded some<font color="#E5E5E5"> mp3s and you delete the</font>

459
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:17,390
mp3s out of Bob's folder and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get</font>

460
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:21,350
more points for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and then they have</font>

461
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:23,809
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do policy enforcement and things like</font>

462
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:28,549
that in order to continuously lock down

463
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:30,770
the boxes until you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 points so</font>

464
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:32,480
there's a couple rounds of this and then

465
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:36,980
it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> into like three tiers like</font>

466
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:40,760
Silver Gold and Platinum I guess and in

467
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:43,190
students work their way up this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

468
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,870
available for middle school students now

469
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:50,430
I believe

470
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:55,350
so getting getting kids started in a

471
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:57,750
very early age right for the college

472
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:01,820
level there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the collegiate cyber</font>

473
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:04,590
defense competition or CCDC where

474
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:07,860
students are<font color="#E5E5E5"> given a small business</font>

475
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:11,129
scenario and there are active red teams

476
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:14,699
on the system attacking them while they

477
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:17,490
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to defend the network there</font>

478
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:20,700
are automated scoring engines but unlike

479
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:23,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">the one for cyber</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Patriot that are on</font>

the host these are external that are

481
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:29,639
pulling their services and checking them

482
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,910
at specific intervals to make sure that

483
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:35,280
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still up and running there is</font>

484
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:37,260
usually simulated network traffic on the

485
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:40,260
competition<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network sometimes you even</font>

486
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:42,780
have what's known as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm's team that</font>

487
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:45,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually plays user roles that goes and</font>

488
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:48,540
tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off the website or</font>

489
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:51,270
sends email using the email server in

490
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,649
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> competition network to verify that</font>

491
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,260
things are still functionally as they

492
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:57,990
should in case the scoring server isn't

493
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:03,120
intelligent enough to detect certain

494
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:05,880
misconfigurations the volunteer red team

495
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,689
is made up of people from industry or

496
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,790
from academia that will provide external

497
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:15,260
threat to give the kids a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

498
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:17,750
a challenge keep it interesting for them

499
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:20,100
so the students have to maintain

500
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,410
availability of services so if you have

501
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,850
a commercial<font color="#E5E5E5"> web server where you're</font>

502
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:26,310
selling a product you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to</font>

503
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:29,669
keep that online<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

504
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:32,159
database<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a mail server or Active</font>

505
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:33,780

506
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">being polled to make sure that they're</font>

507
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:39,750
still up and running I the students were

508
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:41,370
also given business in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jack's so it</font>

509
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:43,920
depends per competition but usually

510
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:46,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">these are like every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hour so they'll be</font>

511
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,870
given certain challenges to do that are

512
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:51,030
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fit whatever business</font>

513
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:55,169
scenario they're currently playing out

514
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:58,520
it depends on where you are but<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

515
00:25:55,170 --> 00:26:00,710
these can be more policy related or more

516
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:04,430
hoarding related or they can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

517
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:06,110
technically challenging for example I've

518
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:09,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> past where students were</font>

519
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:12,530
expected to like write a disaster

520
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,179
recovery policy which they may or may

521
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:17,149
not just copy from somewhere off the

522
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:19,160
internet and submit or they could be

523
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:21,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">giving something like here's a new</font>

524
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:25,040
firewall I want you to evaluate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

525
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:28,910
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's good or bad I've also</font>

526
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:31,370
seen ones where it was much more IT

527
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:35,180
focused like I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to add a printer</font>

528
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:40,820
or I want you to add a specific user or

529
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:42,260
remove a user from the network students

530
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,060
are also expected to detect and respond

531
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,120
to outside threats so you have these red

532
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:48,020
team guys that are attacking the network

533
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,350
and the students have to figure out

534
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:53,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">where they're coming from and how to</font>

535
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:56,600
lock down their services enough to

536
00:26:53,180 --> 00:27:00,500
prevent attacks they get bonus points

537
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:04,850
for writing reports saying for

538
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:07,490
successful detection like an incident<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

539
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:10,610
responder would so if you saw an attack

540
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:13,580
come from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific IP address using a</font>

541
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:16,010
certain method to get in hey I found a

542
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:18,919
web shell on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web server I think they</font>

543
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:21,950
used a sequel injection in this form<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

544
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">get in it's been patched then the</font>

545
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:27,230
students get bonus points for submitting

546
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:29,270
reports like that the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is</font>

547
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:31,460
the balance security needs against

548
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:33,260
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs this is a little bit</font>

549
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:36,470
different than the others<font color="#E5E5E5"> ETFs that are</font>

550
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:38,950
strictly challenge focus this is

551
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:42,290
supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a help prepare them for</font>

552
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:45,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">real-world scenarios as well as get them</font>

553
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:49,490
to a point where they can talk

554
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:53,450
intelligently and professionally about

555
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:55,310
the security of their network right so a

556
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:59,090
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times you will have someone</font>

557
00:27:55,310 --> 00:28:00,830
acting as a CTO or a CEO<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will come</font>

558
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:03,770
in and talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the students and ask them</font>

559
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:06,460
how they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to get updates</font>

560
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">from them</font>

561
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:13,340
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken up into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten regions each</font>

562
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:16,619
region does it slightly differently

563
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:21,769
which can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of a challenge when</font>

564
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:25,738
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go to a national competition because</font>

565
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:28,049
maybe one<font color="#CCCCCC"> region's red team isn't as</font>

566
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:32,669
strong as another region<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trek red team</font>

567
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:34,799
or the index of one region are different

568
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:37,249
from the index of another region so they

569
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:41,309
all do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit differently</font>

570
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:43,559
but that could still keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

571
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:46,590
interesting the last two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years have been</font>

572
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:49,889

574
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:56,189
congratulation to them usually at a CCD

575
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:59,070
see you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have a lot of job offers</font>

576
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:03,929
for the students that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are winning these</font>

577
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:06,059
competitions so it makes for a great

578
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:08,299
resume builder to say that you have

579
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:13,979
participated in these types of events

580
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:18,210
and also an<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity to get</font>

581
00:29:13,979 --> 00:29:22,139
internships or to get jobs once they

00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:23,789
once they graduate here's a quick slide

speaking more locally we do one here

00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:48,989
called the Palmetto cyber defense

592
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:55,440
couple years now and it's based off of

00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:57,799
the CCDC model CCDC is a two-day

competition where it's the same team

595
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:03,658
over a weekend usually we do it a little

596
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,939
differently we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> three-day</font>

00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:12,370
the same time as PC DC so anybody that's

servers that haven't been patched in

still have that one<font color="#E5E5E5"> XP box running that</font>

custom applications that they have

<font color="#E5E5E5">about the lack of offense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by the</font>

to be able to hack the red team back or

644

to attack the other students<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

potentially go wrong

648
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:35,190
so for the sake of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we don't allow</font>

00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:41,940
into a very great area with regard to

you do as<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of injects are the</font>

717
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,609
challenges you get as partisan engine X

718
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:02,420
so it's a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated</font>

719
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:04,820
when it comes down to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

720
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:09,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's talk a little bit more about the</font>

721
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:12,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">teams for PC DC and CCDC so you have</font>

722
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,480
your white team down in front those are

723
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:17,960
your judges those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people that</font>

724
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:20,890
will score and decide read<font color="#E5E5E5"> their reports</font>

725
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:23,240
and and give points back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the teams</font>

726
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:26,930
you have your goal team in the back

727
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:29,750
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people that are building</font>

728
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:33,020
and designing this lab<font color="#CCCCCC"> network which</font>

729
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:34,520
sometimes takes months to do a lot goes

730
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:38,420
into building these networks and these

731
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:40,280
challenges the Black team is usually the

732
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,690
same people<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the Gold team but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

733
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,390
always these are the people that

00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:48,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintain the network during the</font>

735
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:51,230

736
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:54,070

737
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:57,040
sure everything runs smoothly the day of

738
00:36:54,070 --> 00:37:00,010
days of on the far right you have your

739
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,840
blue team those are your students that

740
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:05,290
are there to defend your team they're

741
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:08,230
also the mentors that go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

742
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:12,130
schools to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help educate the kids on the</font>

743
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:14,710
competition spawar has mentors for both

744
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:18,130
cyber Patriot that go out to the schools

745
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:22,030
and volunteer as well as the high school

746
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:24,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">for PC DC to go out and help train them</font>

747
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:27,310
on some of these defensive tools and

748
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:30,850
defensive techniques to prepare them for

749
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:33,640
this competition in the back we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

750
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:38,350
red team those are the attackers these

751
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:41,589
are the ones that will hopefully give

752
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:44,470
the students a little bit keep things

753
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:46,300
interesting for the students by

754
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,980
providing a little adversarial action

755
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:51,880
and a little network traffic for them to

756
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:53,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">help detect and respond to pink team</font>

757
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,360
there really is no pink team but we're

758
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to call these like red team light</font>

759
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,620
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> its favor we have some people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

760
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:03,070
don't get the red team during their

761
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:05,290
normal day job but they like the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

762
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:06,730
it and they are kind of like red teamers

763
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:08,650
and training so we're gonna call those

764
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:11,350
guys were a team white this might be

765
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:12,700
like one day or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one weekend out of</font>

766
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:16,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">the year where they get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come and</font>

767
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:19,480
participate in this stuff right not

768
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:22,990
pictured is the arms team who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

769
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:25,540
users because apparently he didn't show

770
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:29,279
up and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power rangers very often as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

771
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:31,900
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Google's cartridge exactly</font>

772
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,940
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the breakdown</font>

773
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,770
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different teams but by the end of</font>

774
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:38,380
the day the students kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feel like</font>

775
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:42,400
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> judges and red team</font>

776
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:46,750
against them for the entire day so this

777
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the the end of day scenario right so</font>

778
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:50,800
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we how do we overcome that how do</font>

779
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:54,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">we overcome all those Red Team guys</font>

780
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:59,830
right some very simple practices can

781
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:02,170
help<font color="#CCCCCC"> team</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the victorious number one keep</font>

782
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:05,740
calm and change your password a lot of

783
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:07,200
the times red teams are not using secret

784
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:10,379
tools or

785
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:14,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero-day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exploits to gain access to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

786
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:16,589
network they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> your admin login</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

787
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:21,270
still set to admin admin for the

788
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:23,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">password right this is how it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is in the</font>

789
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:25,829
real world<font color="#E5E5E5"> too it's for the most part</font>

790
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:27,890
it's a lot of default credentials if you

791
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:32,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at all the Internet of Things</font>

792
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:35,190
botnet denial of service attacks those

793
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:38,790
botnets just scan the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network for</font>

794
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:43,070
devices with default credentials that's

795
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:43,070
how they got access into those devices

796
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:50,339
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is part of what we as the</font>

797
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:52,349
mentors teach the students and try to

798
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:54,420
get the students<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this is also what</font>

799
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:57,390
sands list is critical security controls

800
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,369
for all businesses to do right these are

801
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:01,828
things everyone should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

802
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:03,450
ensure the safety of their network they

803
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:05,760
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be taking a hardware and software</font>

804
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:09,480
inventory you should know what's on your

805
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,790
network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should know if maybe there's</font>

806
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:14,910
a Raspberry Pi that somebody taped under

807
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:19,020
your table right that's beaconing out to

808
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:20,759
the to the world maybe it's just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns</font>

809
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:23,880
server that somebody locked in a closet

810
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:27,030
and completely forgot about for years

811
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,670
and years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and years all right secure</font>

812
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:33,240
configurations going back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> default</font>

815
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:44,910
allow read access outside of directories

816
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:47,069
that you intended admin privileges who

817
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:50,000
has admin rights does everybody on the

818
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:54,050
network or is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> only specific users I</font>

819
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:58,050
defenses host-based and<font color="#E5E5E5"> network based</font>

820
00:40:54,050 --> 00:41:00,300
application whitelisting and firewall

821
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:03,300
privileges these are things that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

822
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:06,329
worked to get into our PCD competition p

823
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:08,730
cdc competition to give the students

824
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:11,990
some control of their boundary defenses

825
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:15,270
you're also seeing this and a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

826
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:18,328
CCDC competitions as well and are

827
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:19,390
starting to get into the cyber<font color="#CCCCCC"> Patriot</font>

828
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:23,519
competitions

829
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:25,930
with the cisco packet tracer stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

830
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:28,680
at the end you start getting into<font color="#CCCCCC"> data</font>

00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:31,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">recovery making sure you have backups</font>

832
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,788
what happens if the red team wipes your

833
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:37,510
database at the end of the day what

834
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:40,089
happens if you're running a ecommerce

835
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:42,190
server and suddenly you no longer have

836
00:41:40,089 --> 00:41:45,009
track of any of your sales or your

837
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:47,650
inventory or your customers right so

838
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:53,200
that speaks specifically to the business

839
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:54,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">needs of these competitions a couple</font>

840
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">other things in their Incident Response</font>

843
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:06,400
of these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> are obviously important</font>

844
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:12,269
they have to be prioritized by the team

845
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:12,269
and they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be learned by the team</font>

windows guy who's gonna be your

861
00:42:54,730 --> 00:43:03,400
networking guy your forensics guy or

862
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:05,230
lady and to know who to talk to if it's

863
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,690
something happens right if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

864
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:10,450
inject to go do something on the Linux

865
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:13,720
box you need to know who<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give it to</font>

866
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:17,319
or who is available<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the leader they</font>

867
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:21,029
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> accomplish that quickly create</font>

868
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:23,170
playbooks this is the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

869
00:43:21,029 --> 00:43:26,049
real-world scenarios<font color="#CCCCCC"> in real-world</font>

870
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:28,089
businesses if something happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font>

871
00:43:26,049 --> 00:43:30,770
to know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to respond to it you need to</font>

872
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:33,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a solid list of</font>

873
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:39,090
people to contact when certain things

874
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:41,879
happen you need to know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to do</font>

875
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:43,980
in specific scenarios like how to how to

876
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:48,630
recover your database if it should go

877
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:51,890
down right you need password sheets this

878
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:54,150
is somewhat competition specific

879
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:56,940
obviously all the teams should change

880
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:59,640
their passwords so they they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

881
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:01,320
allowed to bring electronic media in but

882
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,230
they are allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring a binder with</font>

883
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:06,660
written notes so a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times he</font>

884
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:09,060
suggests printing out a list of password

885
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:12,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">sheets that you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rotate throughout</font>

886
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:16,740
the day cheat sheets for specific

887
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:21,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">commands and networking to move through</font>

888
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:22,799
quickly and and make changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> or specific</font>

889
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:25,290
websites that you know you need to go

890
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,220
download software from you also need to

891
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:35,310
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what services and users are</font>

892
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:37,709
supposed to be on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network is that</font>

893
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:40,230
ftp server on your network was that

894
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:42,720
edited by you or was that added by the

895
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:45,510
red team to exfiltrate files from your

896
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,730
network right so that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

897
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:50,160
things you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SSH</font>

898
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:52,740
server was that there before I got there

899
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,200
does it say in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> notes that needs to</font>

900
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:56,850
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> running on this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system are all</font>

901
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:01,500
questions the students kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

902
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:03,900
ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves is that wheel user was he</font>

903
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:10,740
there before is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that part of the link</font>

904
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:16,590
system right in the end it's it's really

905
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:19,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">about having fun and learning so this is</font>

906
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:22,520
one example of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a blog</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we stood up</font>

907
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:25,260
on one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the team's servers for them</font>

908
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,670
just to let them know that we cared

909
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:31,590
about them and to see if they were

910
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:33,270
watching to notice that their active

911
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:39,750
directory box now was running web

912
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:41,430
services we also this was part of last

913
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:43,020
year scenario where they had delivery

914
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:46,169
trucks

915
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:49,830
we thoughtfully changed to pop tart debt

916
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:51,390
named cat there to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know add a</font>

917
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:55,380
little levity we know there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

918
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:58,410
stress for all the student teams so we

919
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:00,480
try to supply them with solid memes

920
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:06,710
throughout the day to kind of keep them

921
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:10,860
moving and keep them entertained we also

922
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:13,710
installed keystroke loggers<font color="#E5E5E5"> a to make</font>

923
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:17,640
sure that we knew how to get back into

924
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:19,770
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system but also to kind of keep</font>

925
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:22,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">track on the students and make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

926
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:24,720
we could give<font color="#CCCCCC"> them advice afterwards so</font>

927
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:26,660
you can kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the bottom they want</font>

928
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:30,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get rid of the red</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> team</font>

929
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:33,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that's something that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> red team</font>

930
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:35,850
gets to go after the competition to

931
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:39,509
speak with each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the teams and provide</font>

932
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:42,540
feedback so we if we are on the box and

933
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:45,000
monitoring what they are doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

934
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:47,490
allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to provide better feedback to</font>

935
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,680
the teams if we're locked out from the

936
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:52,259
start of the competition<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we don't</font>

937
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,720
see anything that the teams do they say

938
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:57,870
oh like you know did I did I do well did

939
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:01,230
I you know you know was that successful

940
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:03,330
did I didn't detecting your events and

941
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:05,910
all you can say is you did a great job

942
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:10,490
locking down the firewall but that's all

943
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:12,660
we saw right sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

944
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:14,759
monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box as they're running</font>

945
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,319
search queries and you can watch what

946
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,960
defensive actions they're trying to do

947
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:20,250
to remove you from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network all right</font>

948
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's something you could provide</font>

949
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:25,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the students like hey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I saw you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

950
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:27,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">to remove me here but I had persistence</font>

951
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:29,660
mechanisms that would add it back later

952
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:34,740
right so you have to look for those

953
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:36,779
backup services just a few slides one

954
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:39,750
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also replace the boot loader on</font>

955
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:43,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the laptops with man cat that was a big</font>

956
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:47,670
hit with all the kids in the end I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

957
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:50,460
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most part they can they learn a</font>

958
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:55,140
lot during the process it is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

959
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:56,359
stressful day but<font color="#E5E5E5"> every time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do this</font>

960
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:59,509
competition

961
00:47:56,359 --> 00:48:01,308
we have kind of an out brief with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

962
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:03,259
students<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they give presentations and</font>

963
00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:04,940
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the things they liked and</font>

964
00:48:03,259 --> 00:48:09,440
didn't like and the things they learned

965
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:11,989
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the competition what's very</font>

966
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:15,140
critical is motivation critical thinking

967
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:18,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">and self-study this is true for cts as</font>

968
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:20,808
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> true in life these skills that</font>

969
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:24,279
they are learning also roll into those

970
00:48:20,809 --> 00:48:27,319
careers so as these students are doing

971
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:29,029
these competitions whether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cts or</font>

972
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:31,609
the cyber<font color="#CCCCCC"> defense challenges these are</font>

973
00:48:29,029 --> 00:48:35,150
things that they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to future</font>

974
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:38,269
employers<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something to</font>

975
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:40,549
show for it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can say you</font>

976
00:48:38,269 --> 00:48:45,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">know hey I worked at a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fast-food</font>

977
00:48:40,549 --> 00:48:47,089
restaurant you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know all summer or you</font>

978
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:49,190
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say like hey I did fast food</font>

979
00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:51,650
restaurants all summer<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I also learn</font>

980
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:54,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">how to do pfsense firewalls and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I learn</font>

981
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:57,710
web exploitation and web development and

982
00:48:54,200 --> 00:49:00,828
I did this competition and it's much

983
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:02,720
more impressive as an employer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

984
00:49:00,829 --> 00:49:05,509
that someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is willing to go that extra</font>

985
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:10,519
distance to learn new things especially

986
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:14,089
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this field right so next up I have a</font>

987
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:17,868
couple resources these are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> general</font>

988
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:20,900
practice CTFs there are hundreds of them

989
00:49:17,869 --> 00:49:23,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">out on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet the first one I'll</font>

990
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:25,430
show you in one second but they're all a

991
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:28,789
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> different the CTF time is</font>

992
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:30,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a giant list some of them like</font>

993
00:49:28,789 --> 00:49:34,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">Flair on our kind of reverse engineering</font>

994
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:37,940
challenges some are more linux operating

995
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:40,099
system based summer<font color="#CCCCCC"> web based but</font>

996
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:43,789
they're all a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> different that</font>

997
00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:47,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">first link actually goes to this website</font>

998
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:51,980
so all of these are individual VMs or

999
00:49:47,059 --> 00:49:56,749
individual websites for specific

1000
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:58,549
technologies so there's specific there's

1001

00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:30,710
most of which have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no prior experience</font>

1028
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:32,600
with security and generally are just

1029
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:34,880
taking the standard computer science

1030
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:36,890
classes<font color="#CCCCCC"> their range from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> freshman is</font>

00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:40,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">seniors and it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually really</font>

1032
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:42,650
interesting how a lot of the time in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1033
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:44,750
security team it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> freshmen</font>

1034
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:46,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the seniors and the juniors who are</font>

1035
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:49,610
the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> motivated and therefore do the</font>

1036
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:51,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">best in the club so we compete in cyber</font>

1037
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:54,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">patriots various CTFs throughout the</font>

1038
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:57,050
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then p cdc to end our year</font>

1039
00:51:54,340 --> 00:52:03,260
which brian did a great job of talking

1040
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:05,710
about so this was most this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was mostly</font>

1041
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:07,970
all covered but cyber<font color="#CCCCCC"> Patriot gives</font>

1042
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:10,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">windows windows server and the new bun</font>

1043
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:11,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">two images</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it tries to gamify</font>

1044
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:14,660
something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not so fun to</font>

1045
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:17,180
high schoolers securing and hardening

1046
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:18,680
machines and makes it more fun by

1047
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,839
playing sounds and

1048
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:22,339
giving points based on changing

1049
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:29,410
passwords and setting up local security

1050
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:29,410
policy so it makes people feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font>

1051
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:36,700
so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> peace EDC I'll just skip over the</font>

1052
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:39,109
first two since Brian covered it but

1053
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:41,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">what students tend to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really fun</font>

1054
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:43,940
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC DC is just the the feeling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1055
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:45,740
being being attacked by the red team all

1056
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:47,210
day and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing like thinking</font>

1057
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:49,819
everything's going fine and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then just</font>

1058
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:52,010
seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> an cats or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minecraft servers</font>

1059
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:54,800
popping up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your web on your website</font>

1060
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:57,590
and then also what was fun and past

1061
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,790
years at pc DC is there would be social

1062
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:01,280
engineering there wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> much of this</font>

1063
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:03,110
last year but from what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've heard there</font>

1064
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,420
would be the red team like coming in

1065
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:06,830
with crayon made badges and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring</font>

1066
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:08,330
it in a camera<font color="#CCCCCC"> on just filming the</font>

1067
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:15,319
password sheets and what was happening

1068
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:17,720
on every computer so I found this on

1069
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:20,390
Twitter a couple days ago and it brought

1070
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:24,890
me some flashbacks so by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the</font>

1071
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:33,040
day at pc DC the red team won and not

1072
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:33,040
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it matters but this was our team so</font>

1073
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:38,060
so another thing that i found when

1074
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:40,129
running the cyber security team is that

1075
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:41,390
people find hacking really fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1076
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:45,410
that's really what motivates people to

1077
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:46,520
join the club so obviously that<font color="#E5E5E5"> nick</font>

1078
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:48,410
start training have to have a big

1079
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:51,800
emphasis on ethics you know knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1080
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:53,600
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably go learn something and</font>

1081
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:56,690
then go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes later after our</font>

1082
00:53:53,600 --> 00:54:00,650
break go exploit that on the quarter

1083
00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:02,870
gallon servers which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do and</font>

1084
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:04,460
then CTFs also serve as a great hands-on

1085
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:06,799
learning experience because even if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1086
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:08,690
don't know you'll end up spending enough

1087
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,220
time on the CTF problems where when you

1088
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:17,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">go read or write up it'll all just make</font>

1089
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:19,189
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you so um so on the</font>

1090
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:21,710
twenty-eighth of january we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1112
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:42,890
we take seriously but we also make sure

1113
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:44,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">to keep it fun like we don't just sit</font>

1115
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:51,200
all day and talk about networking and

1116
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:54,200
tcp/ip all day so we meet every Saturday

1117
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:56,210
and we cover ethics obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows</font>

1118
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:59,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">security Active Directory networking and</font>

00:55:56,210 --> 00:56:01,640
then Red Team basics and penetration

1120
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:04,220
testing and we generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> do penetration</font>

1121
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:06,850
testing second semester and just to

1122
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:10,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">ensure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone is aware of the</font>

1123
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:11,839
moral<font color="#CCCCCC"> implications of using the things</font>

1124
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:13,340
that you learn and at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the</font>

1125
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:15,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">year this year we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to all get</font>

1126
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:17,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">security plus certified so all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1127
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:19,790
knowledge you learned so you have

1128
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:21,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">something written for all of the</font>

1129
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:26,500
knowledge that you hopefully learned

1130
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:29,180
throughout the year so<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the future</font>

1131
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:30,860
obviously after we<font color="#E5E5E5"> run the CTF we'd like</font>

1132
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:34,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make it an annual event that possibly</font>

1133
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:35,450
we get sponsors from and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd like</font>

1134
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:38,450
to start competing in more high-level

1135
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:40,790
CTFs that aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily aimed at</font>

1136
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:42,589
high schoolers and then next year

1137
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:45,850
hopefully we're going to have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber</font>

1138
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:45,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">security class at school</font>

1139
00:56:46,030 --> 00:57:08,690
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I got a lot of them are</font>

1140
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:13,130
internationally and rock what's

1141
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:16,760
distributed that you fit so a lot of cts

1142
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:19,400
our health internationally they open it

1143
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:22,430
up during<font color="#CCCCCC"> a weekend and allow anybody to</font>

1144
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:24,650
sign up and compete for the most part it

1145
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:27,109
really depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on each individual CTF</font>

1146
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:28,130
competition like a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

1147
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:32,120
especially the high school and college

1148
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:35,210
ones are set up to award prizes to those

1149
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:38,390
teams but often allow other teams to

1150
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:40,760
register in a non-competition capacity

1151
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:42,259
so they can still get flags they just

1152
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:46,090
won't get into the prize monies or

1153
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:46,090
rewards that they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the schools</font>

1154
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:54,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks any other questions yes this</font>

1155
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">goalkeeper thought about maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> t1</font>

1156
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:06,500
so the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with so the question was</font>

1157
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:13,339
asking if each team should have its own

1158
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:18,680
separate environment which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 through</font>

1159
00:58:13,339 --> 00:58:22,160
16<font color="#CCCCCC"> wonders Yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1160
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:24,919
great if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't have one day to</font>

1161
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:27,348
attack these networks right it's a very

1162
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,700
it's a limitation of a the gold teams

1163
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:31,430
time because then they would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1164
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:34,399
build out different scenarios for each

1165
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:36,348
team and it's a lot harder for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the red</font>

1166
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:39,890
team<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has to basically do a</font>

1167
00:58:36,349 --> 00:58:42,140
penetration test on<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8 networks as</font>

1168
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:44,690
opposed to one network that you can then

1169
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:46,970
share right so it's kind of a time

1170
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:49,329
constraint when you're doing these types

1171
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:49,328
of competitions

1172
00:58:54,369 --> 00:59:02,660
so there are competitions like that it's

1173
00:58:57,829 --> 00:59:06,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">just not the focus of like PC DC and</font>

1174
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:08,960
CCDC again there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some ethical</font>

1175
00:59:06,259 --> 00:59:11,329
constraints when you're talking about

1176
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:14,720
teaching kids to attack networks that

1177
00:59:11,329 --> 00:59:17,420
have to be taken into consideration but

1178
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:20,709
like these guys if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stand up</font>

1179
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:23,990
their own private lab server or network

1180
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:26,029
and attack each other to learn different

1181
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:28,990
techniques and then defend against them

1182
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:31,160
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways to do it</font>

1183
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:35,209
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty of resources on the</font>

1184
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:37,490
internet and for VMS like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks</font>

1185
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:39,019
and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> also in private labs like</font>

1186
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:41,058
that are something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> known SC which</font>

1187
00:59:39,019 --> 00:59:42,890
is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-profit for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security in</font>

1189
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:51,700
Charleston is working to create more of
