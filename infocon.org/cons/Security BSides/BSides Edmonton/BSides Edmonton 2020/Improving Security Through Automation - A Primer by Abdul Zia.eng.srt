1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,869
[Applause]

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,250
so I get to be the last one

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,490
so I'm between you and the weekend so

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:16,770
let's see how I'll fast I can go through

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:20,609
this so I'm gonna cover automation very

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:23,670
much automation focus but gonna try and

7
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,519
talk a lot about security in this in my

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:31,830
opinion automation is kind of the next

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:34,110
step when you're talking security so you

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,050
know automation is is it's coming it's

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,899
we're seeing it with self-driving cars

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,578
we're seeing it with you know pretty

13
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,230
well everything is is getting automated

14
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,899
robotics has been out there forever so

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,010
you know a little bit of a cartoon on

16
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:53,910
everything being automated including

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:56,940
panhandling so this is kind of the

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:59,160
overall agenda just gonna cover

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,739
automation orchestration DevOps kind of

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,080
the differences between the three we

21
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,869
hear all three terms well Trent French

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,220
shade as much as I can between three

23
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:10,290
some of the challenges and trends that

24
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,789
we see so what's actually driving

25
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:16,799
automation and then we're going to talk

26
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,650
a bit about automating human driven

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,740
workflows but more than that we're gonna

28
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,500
talk about event-driven work workflows

29
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:27,119
and then why automation is definitely a

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,460
part of your security posture or why it

31
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,119
just makes everything more secure then a

32
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,589
little bit will touch on getting started

33
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:37,470
so a thing about me and powerpoints and

34
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,310
agendas I'm probably going to end up

35
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:46,770
saying all over the place oh they're

36
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:49,229
just guidelines so let's talk about

37
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,670
automation orchestration and demos so

38
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,360
what is the difference we're hearing

39
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,430
these terms so automation is you know

40
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,840
it's a single task or procedure that

41
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,090
you're you're putting some sort of a

42
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,350
script around so you know in this

43
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,030
example if you're if you're changing

44
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,699
like an SNMP community for changing

45
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,530
passwords across devices so you're

46
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,420
automating a task so you're putting a

47
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,940
script around a task and then you're

48
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,589
pushing that that script out to do what

49
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,420
you used to do manually and now you're

50
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,800
you're automating it no we have we

51
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,230
actually have a lot of tools they'll

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,849
already do this right so one of the

53
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,109
things is though that we have tools that

54
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,869
might do this so you might have tools

55
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,340
that do this for your you know your UNIX

56
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,720
environment you might have tools that do

57
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,830
this for your Windows environment you

58
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,840
might have tools that do this for your

59
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,000
network environment so you have you

60
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,090
probably have tools already do this for

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,620
you one of the things that that having

62
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,230
in the next step of automation in this

63
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,930
and especially in a holistically secure

64
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:45,480
environment is you're gonna have tools

65
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,310
and you want to have tools that cover a

66
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:52,040
large gamut of your infrastructure

67
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:55,920
whether it's it's Unix Linux Windows

68
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,200
routers switches you know that the more

69
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,450
list or even applications the more we

70
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,190
can do in a centralized location and

71
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,069
give us more control that gives you a

72
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,200
little bit of a better security posture

73
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:09,119
the next thing we hear a lot about is

74
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,649
orchestration so what's the difference

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,590
between all automation or registration

76
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,260
so orchestration takes this idea of

77
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,569
automating a task and now we take

78
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,989
multiple tasks and you automate a

79
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:24,958
workflow so you know the example I put

80
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:26,579
here is if you want to if you have if

81
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,440
you want to enable and and connectivity

82
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:30,389
three through switches and routers and

83
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,900
etc furro for an application that would

84
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:38,849
be an orchestration so you know if you

85
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:41,250
roll out a say container and you want to

86
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:43,138
enable ant and for your users the

87
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,019
orchestration portion would be to you

88
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,900
know set up the VNA interface for the VX

89
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:51,930
LAN to enable any firewall rules you

90
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,609
need to set up any virtualized ports all

91
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,120
of that would be the orchestration part

92
00:03:53,609 --> 00:04:00,329
of it where does devops come in so Dell

93
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,090
office is kind of the next step now this

94
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:05,220
is where your developer when they push

95
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,200
out a version of their application and

96
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:11,549
they push out an instance of that

97
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,768
application the operational portion that

98
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:15,419
needs to happen everything that happens

99
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:18,180
in the orchestration that workflow takes

100
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:21,150
care of itself so no longer does your

101
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,460
developer need to call you and say can

102
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:24,310
you do this for me can you do enable

103
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,500
this access

104
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,840
you create this firewall the rule can

105
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:35,070
you give these users access that's all a

106
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:37,840
part of your your DevOps environment so

107
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:42,460
there's one one of the things that we're

108
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,919
seeing a lot now is the cloud what do

109
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:51,280
you guys think is pushing people to the

110
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:55,599
club sorry okay that's actually true

111
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:59,229
yeah so accounting it's it's the it's it

112
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,910
gives you a cost reduction according to

113
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:03,039
you know what the cloud providers say

114
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,610
where does that cost reduction come from

115
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,820
when they go and you plug in an instance

116
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:12,580
at Amazon AWS alright as your Google and

117
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,729
you spin up your your you know your ec2

118
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,800
instance for example you don't have to

119
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:19,750
worry about any of the backend that

120
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,370
happened to get that ec2 instance where

121
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,160
all of that's all done for you

122
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,840
that's all automated and the reason the

123
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,370
account that matters to accounts is

124
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,349
because Amazon can do that way cheaper

125
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,270
than most of us are doing it because

126
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:34,240
we're not automating them you know we

127
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:37,530
haven't automated that so it costs less

128
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,660
and that's the value of the cloud and

129
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:42,900
then they you can also do the DevOps in

130
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,860
the cloud right so you've got your

131
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,570
developers when they push something in

132
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,130
the cloud via the DevOps portion you

133
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,130
know that all can be taken care of too

134
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:53,110
if you if you how if you have the the

135
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,550
services that purchased from the cloud

136
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,950
you got to pay for it but you know it

137
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,110
only gets done so that's where the value

138
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:01,510
of the cloud comes in is the savings and

139
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,750
the security that they you know have

140
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,849
around that is it you know if if company

141
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:10,389
a spins up an instance and Company B

142
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,590
spins up an instance they are separate

143
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:13,450
from each other so there's inherent

144
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:20,789
security built into that automated

145
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:23,349
environment so automation is not about

146
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:26,139
taking away people's jobs right it's not

147
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:29,440
about you know we want to reduce

148
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:31,900
workforce that's always a fear when when

149
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,650
when people hear automation is is what's

150
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,440
going to happen

151
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:37,299
to me as a network administrator or

152
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,139
what's gonna happen to me as a firewall

153
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:45,039
guy and the reality is automation is

154
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:48,490
about changing the way we think so it's

155
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:52,509
about the system's the people the

156
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:54,850
organization it's about a change of on

157
00:06:52,509 --> 00:07:03,550
the way you do things rather than you

158
00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:05,229
know reducing headcount so these are

159
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,380
some of the efficiencies that you know

160
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:10,479
this is this was done by IDC so before

161
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,880
automation you're spending you know

162
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,460
they're 64% of your time

163
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,860
essentially just doing what we call busy

164
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,900
work nobody likes busy work now after

165
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:23,020
automation that gets reduced to 45

166
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,659
percent and this is this was actually

167
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:29,049
just with Network automation if you are

168
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:31,199
the more automation you do in your

169
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,910
environment the less busy work there is

170
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,979
what does that free you guys up to do as

171
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,289
security people as Network people as

172
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:40,750
server people it gets to do the cool

173
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:42,969
stuff it gets you to improve your

174
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,650
environment it gets you to take your

175
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,770
environment where it is today to where

176
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:50,169
you want it to be tomorrow you're you're

177
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,780
not busy doing the administration stuff

178
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:54,490
there really nobody we do it nobody

179
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,369
likes to do that you want to do the new

180
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,990
stuff you don't do the cool stuff right

181
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:03,039
so that's what automation isn't meant to

182
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:06,760
do so this is an interesting graph

183
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:11,169
because where is the inflection point

184
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:13,750
where automation becomes valuable to you

185
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:15,580
if you've got a very small environment

186
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,250
you're not going to invest very much in

187
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,659
automation

188
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:22,210
once you grow to the point where you

189
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:26,199
need automation and if you and you don't

190
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:28,719
have it you can know things can quickly

191
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:32,200
spiral out of control where suddenly you

192
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,560
don't have enough resources we hear so

193
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,800
much about we don't have enough security

194
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:40,329
people it's hard to find security people

195
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,279
you know the reality is is that we need

196
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,990
to learn to use the tools that we have

197
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:49,540
better we need to

198
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:52,570
learn how to take the day-to-day and and

199
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,459
make that more of a of an automated

200
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,899
process so that were not we're not

201
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:57,339
killing our guys are doing firewall

202
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:59,230
changing some things along that lines

203
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:09,580
you know hunting the security threats on

204
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:11,170
their own so this is why because I'm it

205
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,300
done and everything's kind of in its own

206
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,699
little silo you've got all these

207
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:19,060
fragmented little things you've got you

208
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:21,220
know multiple teams you've got all these

209
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,750
applications you've got all this to

210
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,940
different types of connectivity

211
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,950
everybody has their ideas around what

212
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,800
goes where and who can access what and

213
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,330
what kind of security everybody needs

214
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,010
you've got multiple sources of truth so

215
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,890
really there's there's so much pregnant

216
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:38,200
ation one of the things that we do

217
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,910
really well is is we're all specialized

218
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,370
a lot of us in certain things maybe we

219
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:47,380
might be we may be very focused in our

220
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:49,120
area so as as overall security people we

221
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,760
need to come together and understand

222
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,300
that security takes needs to take a more

223
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:59,950
overall view so your desktop guys your

224
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:01,870
firewall guys your database guys you all

225
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:05,920
kind of need you they all need to come

226
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:07,839
together and make it a more of a you

227
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,890
know what goes in what silo from a

228
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:14,170
perspective of Technology culture and

229
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,790
processes which are the three kind of

230
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,610
what I would what I call them or what we

231
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:20,980
call the you know the pillars of

232
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,890
automation because you need to build

233
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:28,240
around these three to make automation as

234
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:30,220
a party or your company culture so

235
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:38,350
where's automation going and where is it

236
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:40,240
today well so they zero Mikkel Singh's

237
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,760
is the human driven stuff so this is the

238
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,089
stuff that's really easy to automate so

239
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,759
this is the things like password changes

240
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:50,160
you know listen P string changes stuff

241
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,079
that you do you know you log into a box

242
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,910
manually and you change it and then you

243
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,160
log into another box and you change it

244
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,990
you know we've got a system now almost

245
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,459
everybody has those they can do that LR

246
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:05,759
skill day one and this is really where

247
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:09,149
security starts to play so this is

248
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:14,009
event-driven automation event-driven

249
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:17,459
automation is when you have something

250
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:19,230
that is outside of what a human does so

251
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:21,508
for example security incident is a

252
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:25,439
perfect example and that security

253
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:29,220
incident now drives a script or a change

254
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:34,529
in the environment that is essentially

255
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:37,889
event-driven automation the next one is

256
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:40,800
the the machine driven machine learning

257
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:43,139
automation we this is this is where

258
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,399
things are interesting and things will

259
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:48,569
get more interesting so that a couple of

260
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,509
gentlemen one was talking about

261
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:54,240
baselining baselining in network another

262
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:55,709
talked about threat hunting so you kind

263
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,009
of bring that together and he starts

264
00:11:55,709 --> 00:12:00,989
thinking well should we do that as human

265
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:03,929
driven should we do that as people and

266
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:07,019
try and baseline it or you know do we

267
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:08,879
grab our baselines you know we throw it

268
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,220
into a big data system and let our

269
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:15,629
machines determine what our baselines

270
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:18,449
are and then let the Machine learn when

271
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:21,059
you deviate from those baselines and not

272
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:26,339
just network based lines but processors

273
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:28,410
on the machine on a PC so if you know

274
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:31,379
the pro system normally averages you

275
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:35,129
know 25 to 30 percent a day and suddenly

276
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:37,589
sitting at 55 percent you know there is

277
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:39,899
above your baseline but as individuals

278
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:41,610
as people we probably can't do that but

279
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:44,819
if you have a machine doing that for you

280
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:49,889
now it can learn that this is happening

281
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:51,748
and then you know at some point you know

282
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:54,389
it'll it'll send you hate is this normal

283
00:12:51,749 --> 00:12:56,399
you go look at it not normal and then

284
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:58,470
you act upon it now it's learn next time

285
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,329
it sees that you know it'll take

286
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,730
it'll take the appropriate action and as

287
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:04,258
it learns it'll start to understand you

288
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,199
know what's normal it's not normal and

289
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:08,100
then the only time you'll need human

290
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:09,420
intervention is where the machine is

291
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,259
kind of like oh I don't know what to do

292
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:15,628
with this but the more we're able to

293
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,879
learn what's normal and what's abnormal

294
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:19,529
and the machine is able to and we put

295
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,689
that into the system and the system is

296
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:24,209
able to learn that the less we have to

297
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:27,959
do as administrators and the and

298
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:30,300
automation takes care for you so and and

299
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:32,069
that's really the panacea of where

300
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,469
automation can take us from a security

301
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:37,709
perspective is that we're no longer

302
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:39,839
having to the threat hunt we're no

303
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:41,489
longer having to look for Evelynn

304
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,009
abilities ourselves we're no longer

305
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,680
having to go through our logs and look

306
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:54,500
for problems it's all done cannibal on

307
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:57,060
the backend so human driven workflows

308
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,649
always the easiest automate so if you've

309
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,469
got human driven workflows that you're

310
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:04,170
still doing manually this is really the

311
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:06,180
low-hanging fruit so how do you find

312
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,709
what should I automate if you're doing

313
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,620
it over and over again if you're

314
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:11,880
something that you're you know every six

315
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,399
months you know you get a bunch of

316
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,860
people and they go through a process

317
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:21,259
it's repeatable it's requires several

318
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:25,980
steps needs more than a couple of users

319
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:28,110
time-sensitive an error-prone I've done

320
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:31,230
you know in past lives where you have to

321
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:34,410
go through and change passwords on you

322
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:36,360
know 30 40 devices done and manually and

323
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:39,000
there were four or five of us doing it

324
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,920
that's a couple hundred devices how many

325
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,649
of those do you think we accidentally

326
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:46,649
typed in the wrong password quite a few

327
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:49,019
it's like you know one in 110 which is

328
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:50,970
like 10% we would have to go back and so

329
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:53,189
that's the type of work in the cost on

330
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:56,129
doing that manually so if you're doing

331
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:59,490
anything in your environment the fit CDs

332
00:14:56,129 --> 00:15:01,740
you know whether it's on Windows servers

333
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:04,500
whether it's in Linux whether it's it's

334
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,300
switching routing firewalls these type

335
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,610
of manual processes start looking at

336
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,729
these and say how can we take these

337
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:15,579
things and now

338
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:19,089
make them into an automotive process and

339
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:23,199
here's why so on the bottom of this it's

340
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:24,550
all about time so if you are doing if

341
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,469
you do something like this manually in

342
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:29,800
this example I'm using L you've got an

343
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:32,769
administrator that leaves and you know

344
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,599
every device has generally a root

345
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:37,120
password I mean we're trying to get away

346
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:40,029
from that but still you need to have a

347
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,519
back door if you get locked to odor if

348
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:44,290
know what their authentication works so

349
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,209
say that guide leads my god I do this

350
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,980
manually you're talking depending on the

351
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:51,660
number of devices it could be hours days

352
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,949
could even weeks if you did it manually

353
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,000
if you have an automated system it's

354
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:57,939
probably gonna take you a few minutes

355
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,500
right the reality is you go you decide

356
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,000
on a new password or you generate a

357
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,730
password throw into your system and it's

358
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,690
done so minutes from a security

359
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:10,870
perspective you know this guy's gruntled

360
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:13,149
he's got all disgruntled he's got all

361
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:17,290
that time to possibly come in and do

362
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:19,029
damage to you in this he probably won't

363
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,980
be able to do any damage rate so there

364
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:23,399
is from a security perspective why this

365
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,399
matters

366
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:31,410
event-driven so you know non user driven

367
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:34,260
workflows so things like security

368
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:36,120
incidents network outages things that

369
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:39,780
happen because of something non human

370
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,180
driven so you know power outage or for a

371
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:45,900
reboot or something that is unexpected

372
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:49,349
on the that's an event but the other

373
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:54,240
thing to think about is is when when I

374
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:56,490
walk into you know Nate with my phone

375
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:01,440
and I connect to the Wi-Fi that is also

376
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:04,109
an event and bringing onboarding me

377
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,900
making sure I'm on the right VLAN I'm

378
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:09,389
making sure I'm not you know that I'm

379
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,880
not connected into like for example in

380
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:15,660
network I shouldn't be that's also an

381
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:18,930
event so you know that managing that

382
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,000
access is also automation and you know a

383
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:24,329
lot of that's all often handled by a

384
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,270
network access control system that is an

385
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:29,070
automation system we call them different

386
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:32,370
things but we have some of these systems

387
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:42,080
around the important thing is to get

388
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:45,110
these guys working together so events

389
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,419
you guys remember back in the days when

390
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:50,070
SMB type of viruses were a big deal

391
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,720
they'd get a virus and the first thing

392
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:55,740
you would try and do is find open shares

393
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,210
now it's read somewhere where you know

394
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,160
the rats and where it tries to go out

395
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,480
and lock down as many machines as

396
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:06,360
possible and infect

397
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:08,730
so again minused hours if you catch that

398
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,060
and try and resolve it manually you know

399
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,500
you go you get some sort of a nerd alert

400
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:15,899
you know some sort of a ticket goes out

401
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,000
and then people run around time try and

402
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,560
finally the person may be there on a

403
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,170
Wi-Fi and they're moving from access

404
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,370
point to access point or boardroom to

405
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,590
boardroom they're not even from your

406
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:28,649
environment you know that can take a

407
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:31,409
long time you automate that that's good

408
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:34,020
that's that seconds that your automate

409
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,550
your system your firewall whatever you

410
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,980
have that's going to detect that threat

411
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:40,200
it's gonna take that

412
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,950
and neutralize that threat almost

413
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,480
immediately

414
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:48,990
so again time is a factor time is the

415
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:53,909
number one thing when it comes to when

416
00:18:48,990 --> 00:19:01,320
it comes to security and and threats and

417
00:18:53,909 --> 00:19:06,299
that's what automation buys you so just

418
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:09,149
get into a little bit of automate when

419
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:13,679
you're automating security events it's

420
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:17,779
actually as simple as if-then right if

421
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:20,370
this happens then take this action you

422
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:24,840
know so for example you know if an

423
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:28,199
infection is detected then assign to

424
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:30,360
quarantine VLAN so you know obviously we

425
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,669
you know as IT people we've all seen

426
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,559
pseudocode how this looks in your

427
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:38,100
environment will vary you know whether

428
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:40,289
it's some sort of a system that you've

429
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:43,110
purchased or it's a system that you've

430
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:45,210
developed this is essentially what

431
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:48,600
you're going to be doing and what goes

432
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:51,000
under that if will grow right so you

433
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:55,699
know a couple if you see a port scan if

434
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,350
I see you know infected file if and then

435
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:02,460
you know you can just add to it

436
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:03,809
and that if statement can grow well you

437
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:09,090
get you know you kind of get the picture

438
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:11,158
so time is your enemy you can't mention

439
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:13,439
this so automation of both human driven

440
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:15,539
events that's it's all about reducing

441
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,029
the time it's all about the time to

442
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:21,750
recover find that event act

443
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:24,289
don't let that infection spread and keep

444
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,289
yourself safe

445
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:34,070
so you know what does it all look like

446
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:35,720
you know I'm I'm a to have a pretty

447
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:37,850
solid Network background so I'm gonna go

448
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,680
on the network side of things so you're

449
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,050
gonna have a bunch of switches probably

450
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,900
you know you have some sort of an NG FW

451
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:48,560
firewall of some sort you probably take

452
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:51,350
some sort of scans off your switches for

453
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:55,570
like a flow data office which is put

454
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:58,520
that into some sort of Sam and logging

455
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:00,980
then you'll have what we call you know

456
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,990
I've called it an analytics engine some

457
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:08,000
sort of telemetry some sort of

458
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:10,280
intelligence what that is you know

459
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,560
there's there's products available

460
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,800
there's there's things that are kind of

461
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,090
coming is anything kind of ready you

462
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,730
know there's there's probably a few

463
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:21,770
things you can plug into to work on

464
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,930
these stats but really the reality is

465
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:28,010
that that analytics engine whatever you

466
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:31,520
use it has to be customized for your

467
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:34,850
environment right so for example if you

468
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,400
have a SCADA environment and you know

469
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,439
you're gonna see a certain you know

470
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:43,490
skiddo skiddo traffic generally is very

471
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:46,580
very low low bandwidth so you know

472
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,960
that's it's gonna maybe your analytics

473
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,270
engine now must be programmed for that

474
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,890
very low bandwidth an attack on a SCADA

475
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:56,480
environment is something we call low and

476
00:21:51,890 --> 00:22:00,530
slow so it could just be instead of 16k

477
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:05,450
of traffic you know you're seeing 18 K

478
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:06,710
of traffic so now ya understand that so

479
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,090
whatever I'll it extends and you use

480
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,230
whatever telemetry you're going to use

481
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:13,879
whatever intelligence you're going to

482
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:17,570
use to create your do the intelligence

483
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,950
behind your automation then that's going

484
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,159
to go into your automation tool so hey

485
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:24,290
go take this action on my my firewall or

486
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,850
my switches you know block that MAC

487
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,700
address or move down MAC address to

488
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:32,730
quarantine or what

489
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:37,520
you there's some very large environments

490
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:40,200
that I'm aware of where people there are

491
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,560
thousands and thousands and thousands of

492
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:47,700
switches and there are less than 10

493
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:49,500
network administrator's what they do to

494
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,820
make changes if you remember that

495
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,610
statement if it's happened before it's

496
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,810
gonna happen again generally if you're

497
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:57,290
making a change once you're probably

498
00:22:54,810 --> 00:23:00,419
gonna make it again

499
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:01,830
so they all they do is they log into

500
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,560
their automation tool they don't have

501
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:07,139
access to their firewall they don't have

502
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:10,379
access to their switches they can only

503
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,780
go into their automation tool write

504
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,340
scripts write program it do some

505
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:18,240
programming on there and then that gets

506
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:21,480
reviewed and then pushed out so once

507
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,950
that one is written once now you go and

508
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,380
you change some variables and then you

509
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,590
do it again for your next change or what

510
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,590
have you

511
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:38,178
so you know how do you get started this

512
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:38,679
is a bit of a nightshirt ago step back

513
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:42,590
here

514
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:44,119
so really it's all about what are you

515
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:46,399
looking to get out of it you got to have

516
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:50,119
a strategy and you gotta dig into the

517
00:23:46,399 --> 00:23:52,719
why why am I gonna do this is it just to

518
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:56,449
reduce costs that's honestly not gonna

519
00:23:52,720 --> 00:24:00,320
that's that's not a that's not a good

520
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:03,110
driver to automate because the way

521
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,090
things are getting complicated if you

522
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,609
want to do anything in a black box

523
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:10,488
someone talked about outsourcing

524
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:12,320
yesterday both sourcing to an extent is

525
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:14,779
like let me try and try everything about

526
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,289
this black box and not worry about it

527
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:19,609
the work still has to happen so

528
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:21,169
determine what you want

529
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:22,850
why are you automating are you looking

530
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:25,580
for what kind of efficiencies are you

531
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:30,199
looking for dig into the why why am i

532
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:34,428
why do I want my switches to the

533
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,139
automate why do I want my my UNIX guys

534
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:38,029
to not be able to Darryl aughh directly

535
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:39,979
into my UNIX box the other one so dig

536
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:44,690
into the why you want to do this lay

537
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:48,230
that out as a very robust strategy on on

538
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:50,899
automation understand the skill sets

539
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:54,350
that are required so this is something

540
00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:56,840
that's that's really changed in the past

541
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:58,549
three to four years right a lot of guys

542
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,070
that are maybe network admins or UNIX

543
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:05,179
admins or whatever some of us hadn't

544
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:07,609
written code in 15 20 years now we gotta

545
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:10,789
go and learn Python yeah go learn how to

546
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:13,730
script how to write code so coding

547
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:16,970
skills are now becoming more and more

548
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:20,269
valuable again we say there's not a lot

549
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:22,399
of security people out there mate

550
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:25,879
graduates a lot of coders every year you

551
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:28,189
have a you see you know sait so coders

552
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:30,020
are out there you gotta maybe teach them

553
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,360
a little bit of security and then some

554
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:36,530
or protocols so understand the skill

555
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:38,479
sets that are out there so I understand

556
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:41,540
the automation capabilities of your

557
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,150
platforms or air platforms what kind of

558
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,409
api's do they have what can they do from

559
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,810
an automation perspective what can

560
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:49,850
automation they support are they are the

561
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:51,889
automation of verse you know there are

562
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:57,969
platforms out there that are really

563
00:25:51,890 --> 00:26:03,100
closed and so understand that capability

564
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:07,250
and then you're gonna look at tool sets

565
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:10,250
and tool sets is where you really want

566
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:13,580
to look at something that automates not

567
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:17,540
just one subset of your environment and

568
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:18,860
we talked earlier about teams you want

569
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:20,600
to bring all your teams together to

570
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:23,570
decide any tool set because you don't

571
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:28,189
want a tool set that just does one type

572
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:29,510
of hard one type of infrastructure in

573
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,370
Europe you don't want something just as

574
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,930
servers you don't want something just as

575
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:36,800
virtualization you want something that

576
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:40,300
does as broad as possible so you decide

577
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:43,310
on your tool sets and then from there

578
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:45,950
it's you know you've got to start small

579
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:48,399
you start with you you start with the

580
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:51,620
with the easy the low-hanging fruit

581
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,590
first you automate the New York astrayed

582
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:56,750
and then you move DevOps and honestly I

583
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:59,780
mean unless you're actually writing code

584
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:02,630
and deploying code into an environment

585
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:05,920
there's a lot of a lot of us that will

586
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,920
never even move into DevOps

587
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:14,929
so again you know so it this means kind

588
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:17,960
of breaking some of those walls

589
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:21,290
this means your firewall guys and I

590
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,730
gotta go talk to your windows guy we

591
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,170
need to have those cross-functional

592
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:27,680
teams people that can collaborate with

593
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:31,460
each other we need the you need your

594
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,990
goals clearly laid out it's time to an

595
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,400
approach to everything essentially you

596
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:38,000
know understanding what you're trying to

597
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,960
get at and you want to evangelize the

598
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
benefits of audit

599
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,650
not everybody's gonna understand like we

600
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,330
talked earlier some there's gonna be

601
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:47,270
resistance some folks are gonna think

602
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:50,540
you're gonna take their jobs you know

603
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:53,120
that's that's not really how it works it

604
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,490
just it's a it's a gonna be a change in

605
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,919
the way folks do their jobs

606
00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:04,370
it's not hard to go out and learn Python

607
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:06,890
it's couple of weeks to be honest so you

608
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:10,909
know a lot of people to make mistakes no

609
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:12,890
anybody here never made a mistake I've

610
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:16,430
taken down some very large environments

611
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:21,550
I'm not gonna say which and how but it's

612
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:26,450
you know we've all done when you put

613
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:28,820
instead of putting the IP address and

614
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:31,520
two instead of putting your default

615
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:33,980
gateway in the default gateway you put

616
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,840
in the IP address and now you've

617
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,940
duplicated the default gateway for an

618
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:42,040
entire organization of 10,000 people and

619
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:46,340
killed everybody's internet access

620
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:48,200
Automation would've fixed problems so a

621
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,520
lot of tools out there I mean it's a bit

622
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,950
of an eye chart there's a lot of people

623
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,330
doing this but if you look at this list

624
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:59,390
there's some does they're gonna stand

625
00:28:53,330 --> 00:29:04,909
out python is has taken over as really

626
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:06,590
the de-facto language for automation and

627
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:10,210
there's a few here that need agents

628
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:12,320
there's a few that work for with certain

629
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:14,870
platforms with some work better with

630
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,370
others interestingly enough a lot of

631
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:23,060
these automation tools talk to each

632
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:25,699
other so let's say you want to go and

633
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:27,590
start saying okay I will have I want to

634
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:30,170
go and start playing or whether what is

635
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:33,760
this automation thing long so ansible

636
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:36,740
I mean it's is dead easy easy to install

637
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,650
I work for juniper I don't work for

638
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,180
ansible I'm just gonna put out there and

639
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:45,230
so there's a free word version which you

640
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:48,860
can use CLI base it really gives you an

641
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:51,320
idea of how what automation looks like

642
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,399
and I think it can do things like Linux

643
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,730
automation it can do

644
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:57,680
raesha flood network devices and Malad

645
00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:02,540
networking devices are right - for

646
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:06,350
automation and I thought so

647
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:07,879
code Kadim II anybody use it Kotick Adam

648
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:10,370
II is good got a pretty good course on

649
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,550
Python of course you know Python you can

650
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:14,300
learn it I've made and fade in all those

651
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:17,000
places

652
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:19,639
Coursera as information on Python Python

653
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,540
so if you want to learn kind of where do

654
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,420
