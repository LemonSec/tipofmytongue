Act and additional criminal charges and

55
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:36,069
so that rounds out our panel this

56
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:41,769
morning so what are we here to talk

57
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:44,530
about I named this session women in

58
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:47,980
cybersecurity brute-forcing the glass

59
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:51,579
ceiling and we've had a lot of research

60
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:54,459
recently a lot of pieces being written

61
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:58,329
about the gap of talent in cybersecurity

62
00:02:54,459 --> 00:03:00,010
and in addition to that gap we've seen

63
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:02,069
stats there's a there's a particular

64
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:06,010
study that was done by Frost & Sullivan

65
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:09,629
a few years ago that highlighted in

66
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:12,129
about 2020 we'll need almost 2 million

67
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:15,358
cybersecurity professionals and we just

68
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:18,448
don't have the numbers to fill that need

69
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:21,220
additionally that study points out that

70
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:24,340
currently women in cyber security only

71
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:29,049
represent about 10% of the industry 11%

72
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:30,879
but yeah 10% right so we have this gap

73
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:32,500
and currently women are just under

74
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,929
represented in the industry so today we

75
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,859
wanted to talk about is this is this

76
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,620
really an issue

77
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:40,930
are we really underrepresented and I

78
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:44,439
think we'll find that it is then what do

79
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:47,590
we do right so 2020 is just around the

80
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:50,290
corner how do we address this issue and

81
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:56,139
cyber security and so I'm gonna go right

82
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:59,319
into questions ladies I thought we could

83
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:03,099
get started with your story each of your

84
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:05,379
stories so essentially how did you get

85
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:07,388
your start in the industry was it kind

86
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:09,780
of something that you fell into or was

87
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:12,489
it something that you always knew you do

88
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,700
perfect ok thank you

89
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,399
making sure

90
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,140
so many years ago while I was working in

91
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,640
India as part of the professional

92
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,738
development program I got an opportunity

93
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,750
to undergo an extensive one month

94
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:24,799
training offered by Cisco it was a

95
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,420
network security

96
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,690
so Cisco was brought into our

97
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,520
organization to train a group of us and

98
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,280
then the expectation was that we will

99
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,890
train others in our environment and that

100
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,099
training was followed by some sessions

101
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:43,820
where we could develop ourselves further

102
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:46,370
if we want to as part of the training I

103
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,530
got to configure write routers I got to

104
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,680
program firewalls and I learned quite a

105
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,090
lot about network security and the

106
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,970
knowledge I acquired at that time I

107
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,380
realize how critical security is for any

108
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,290
system design development of

109
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,510
configuration and how significant impact

110
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:05,090
it can have on organizations if not done

111
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,710
right and since then cyber security has

112
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,530
been my passion I have worked hard to

113
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,989
develop myself in this field when I came

114
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,280
to Canada 10 years ago I did my master's

115
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,680
in information system security

116
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,719
management and that program really

117
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,850
enhanced my knowledge and exposure about

118
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,610
the technical aspect the governance

119
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:26,360
aspect in the audit aspect of cyber

120
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:33,530
security and yeah so this has been my

121
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:35,960
passion so far so my background is not

122
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:39,320
so much in technology although I always

123
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:42,260
follow technology and picked up classes

124
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,419
in computer science but my background is

125
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,120
truly business but through the course of

126
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:50,000
my career I've always been involved in

127
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:55,100
managing technology or governance of

128
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,700
technology and so have developed a real

129
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:02,030
facility for talking to business about

130
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:04,909
technology challenges in a way that the

131
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,830
business understands what the risk is to

132
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:10,960
them and what the potential benefit is

133
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:13,400
to them and do it and through that

134
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,039
became very good at organizational

135
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,289
change so my organization invited me to

136
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:20,570
take on the challenge of taking on

137
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:22,849
enterprise risk management with a focus

138
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,560
on IT and you can't talk about risk

139
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,950
management

140
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,780
I tea without talking about security so

141
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,340
about a year ago they just threw up

142
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,260
their hands and said well that's it now

143
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,810
you're responsible for the governance of

144
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:39,039
IT security as well as IT risk

145
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:42,700
management and it's although I fell into

146
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,260
it I'm fascinated by it and love a

147
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,150
learning challenge and this certainly

148
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,280
has been a learning challenge but I

149
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,229
still get to do those things that I'm

150
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,859
good at is talked to the business about

151
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:55,300
how IT security represents a risk to

152
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,560
them and put it in terms that's

153
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,770
meaningful to them

154
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:05,139
so that IT can move forward doing the

155
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:08,469
right things yeah Rachel so I fell into

156
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:10,300
it I when I was in university I was

157
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,550
gonna change the world right I was gonna

158
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,260
I was gonna be part of you know United

159
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,690
Nations I was gonna do all this great

160
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,570
work and and I have an undergrad degree

161
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:21,340
in political science and when I

162
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:24,010
graduated with that degree I couldn't

163
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,989
get a job I only speak English and I'm

164
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,550
not fluent in any other languages and I

165
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,460
quickly learned that if I wanted to work

166
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,500
in those areas I needed to develop some

167
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:35,799
other skills so I took a real practical

168
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,330
approach after six months or so of

169
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,250
realizing that I wasn't going to get to

170
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,320
where I wanted to be with an undergrad

171
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,450
in political science so I got a master's

172
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,190
degree in public administration and as

173
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:48,550
part of that I had a practicum where I

174
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:50,620
worked at for the government of Manitoba

175
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,330
and a small little office called the

176
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,620
office of information technology that

177
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,810
was what it was called and during that

178
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,700
time and this may date me

179
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,380
we were actually developing the security

180
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,060
policy for the government of Manitoba

181
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,070
because there was no unified security

182
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,229
policy for the government of Manitoba

183
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,330
back then and back then I was the only

184
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:07,810
woman in that in that office everybody

185
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,690
else

186
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:12,310
we had deputy ministers and and so on

187
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,760
everybody else in the office was male

188
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:18,280
and then from that position I sort of

189
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,840
fell into privacy and I think I offer a

190
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,869
little bit of a unique perspective here

191
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,000
because privacy is at least in Alberta

192
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,550
it is definitely female dominated as

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,100
opposed to male dominated but I've

194
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,900
worked in those fields prior to working

195
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,750
at the Commissioner's Office where I was

196
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,659
I

197
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:38,419
the only woman in the office or one of a

198
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:42,860
clear minority in there so but I fell

199
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:44,899
into it after I had after I died worked

200
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,350
for the government in Manitoba I ended

201
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:49,819
up working for Alberta Health and and

202
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,990
sort of fell into working with the

203
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:53,839
Health Information Act and health

204
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,819
privacy from there and then I I really

205
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,060
really loved it I really love what I do

206
00:08:55,819 --> 00:09:00,979
I love the opportunity to protect rights

207
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,689
and that kind of goes back to what my

208
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,550
undergrad degree was really about anyway

209
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:05,660
I wanted to change the world and I'm not

210
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,490
really changing the world necessarily

211
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,399
but I do think that I'm working to

212
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,230
protect the rights of Albertans so it

213
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,629
wasn't exactly what I'd planned on doing

214
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,730
but through weaving through a couple of

215
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:20,300
different areas I fell into it and I

216
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,550
really love what I do today all right I

217
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,729
think probably what I take away from

218
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:27,319
that is you know getting into the

219
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,879
industry can look a lot of different

220
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:31,069
ways a lot of times we think it's

221
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,199
something that's linear you know you

222
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:35,000
have to maybe that's been your dream for

223
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:37,008
like 20 years and you've worked on that

224
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,120
all your life but a lot of times it

225
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,550
doesn't have to look like that

226
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:44,740
and so that doesn't have to be a barrier

227
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:47,930
to entry what about um what about

228
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:51,019
challenges like what kind of challenges

229
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:58,128
have you faced you know in your career

230
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:59,839
dust water so I would say coming to

231
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:02,050
Canada with a limited knowledge of

232
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,360
Canadian culture Canadian work culture

233
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:07,639
was a challenge raising my young child

234
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,620
with doing my Master's and searching for

235
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:14,420
charm force a challenge so it but but I

236
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,360
successfully rose up to every challenge

237
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,410
and embedded myself successfully and I

238
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,180
think that's the best way to educate

239
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:24,379
yourself and embed yourself so

240
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,239
especially because I was an immigrant

241
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:28,040
woman there roars different some

242
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,720
different challenges which might not be

243
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,879
there for women who are already born and

244
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,879
raised here and then the biggest

245
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:37,699
challenge was balancing family

246
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,579
commitment with work because I come from

247
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:42,359
India and in Indian culture there are

248
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:44,488
more expectations from women and family

249
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,600
that's not that it's not that my husband

250
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:47,970
doesn't support me but it's just

251
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,879
something in our culture that we have

252
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:54,480
their more expectation the family so I

253
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:56,459
think this was a challenge just as a

254
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,379
woman I had to work extra extra hard

255
00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:00,540
stretch myself to really balance more

256
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:02,249
great well take it a little bit deeper

257
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:06,868
into that in just a minute

258
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:10,319
chef Lauren so I'm going to talk about

259
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:12,360
two things one is and and this will date

260
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:18,899
me far worse than anything that Rachel's

261
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:21,110
said I entered the workforce at a time

262
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:24,600
before the Human Rights Charter so

263
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:27,720
there's some extraordinary stories that

264
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:30,179
go back there but one in particular and

265
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,379
I'll talk about my reaction to it and I

266
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:35,399
think it's still the appropriate

267
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:37,589
reaction today is that when I I was in a

268
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,259
position where I was training management

269
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:43,170
trainees and I went to the senior HR

270
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:45,929
resource person in this institution who

271
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,969
happened to be a woman and said I want

272
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:50,069
to become a management trainee I want to

273
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:53,759
get into that program and she looked at

274
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:55,949
me dead in the eye and said no we would

275
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:59,660
not put you in because you're most

276
00:11:55,949 --> 00:12:03,029
likely to get married and have children

277
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,049
and at that point it struck me is

278
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:06,839
extraordinary

279
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:10,230
but it wasn't that unusual at that time

280
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:12,629
it was unusual to have it put that blank

281
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:16,230
Point Blank to you but it wasn't that

282
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:18,869
unusual as an attitude and my choice at

283
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,449
that point was to quit training the

284
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:23,610
management trainees and go find myself a

285
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:26,189
position in an organization that was far

286
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,720
more supportive I still think that's the

287
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:29,549
right thing is that you need to choose

288
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,889
your battles and if you end up in a

289
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:34,199
situation with an employer who is not

290
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:37,230
supportive and that doesn't matter if

291
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:41,689
it's gender or if it's a race or or if

292
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:45,239
it's whatever your situation is is that

293
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:47,819
you don't you know burn your bridges but

294
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:50,610
go find there are lots of good employers

295
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:53,160
go find a good employer and develop your

296
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,139
potential in a place that's going to

297
00:12:53,160 --> 00:13:00,118
allow you to develop your potential and

298
00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:01,709
potential people around you yeah just so

299
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:02,819
I knew that we were gonna be asked this

300
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:05,219
question ahead of time and I thought

301
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:13,589
about it a lot and I went very different

302
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:16,980
ways yeah and and I I decided that I'd

303
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:18,029
shared share something quite honest with

304
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,249
you and then kind of go in a different

305
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,389
direction so the first thing is it's

306
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:24,179
when I first got out in the workforce

307
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:26,100
and my first real job I was like I said

308
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,929
the only woman in the room and literally

309
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,779
the only the only woman who was involved

310
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:31,889
in in writing a security policy and for

311
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,269
those of you who haven't been in

312
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:34,529
government implementing change in

313
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:36,749
government especially when it's across

314
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:38,339
government is challenging probably like

315
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:40,529
most organizations I would guess but

316
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,809
it's and you were challenged a lot in

317
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:45,989
those positions and and when you're

318
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:47,639
trying to implement change and it was it

319
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:51,119
was intimidating a lot when you're in a

320
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,889
room surrounded by when you're the only

321
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:55,829
woman sometimes you can feel that you

322
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:57,269
feel that like you sense that you might

323
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:59,729
not have the same level of credibility

324
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:02,249
and being young as well I just finished

325
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:05,309
my master's degree so that was

326
00:14:02,249 --> 00:14:06,720
challenging early on lately I would I

327
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:10,559
would steer this in a slightly different

328
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,660
direction and say that my biggest

329
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,009
challenge today is try and I'm which is

330
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,259
why I'm so pleased that I have the

331
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:18,569
opportunity to be here today is to try

332
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:20,040
and unite the security world and the

333
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:21,899
privacy world a little bit better where

334
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,549
sometimes where your best friend and

335
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:27,329
organizations and other times we seem to

336
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:29,309
be eyeties worst enemy and I find that a

337
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:31,919
constant challenge outside of my office

338
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:33,779
when we're working with organizations

339
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,429
large medium and small it seems like

340
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,889
sometimes where they're still on very

341
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:39,629
different levels and it's a challenge

342
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:42,119
that I have faced from those early early

343
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,499
days up until now it's and it's

344
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:48,269
something that I really want to work to

345
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:50,879
change going forward so my next question

346
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:53,399
was really going to be do you think that

347
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:56,339
women face different challenges than men

348
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:58,589
do in the industry but I think that you

349
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:01,499
already kind of alluded to the fact that

350
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:04,259
maybe we do so

351
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:05,279
I'll just I'll just ask something that

352
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:08,730
kind of has been on

353
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,699
for some time we've seen a lot of

354
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:14,310
reports that there is various gender

355
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:16,589
inequality in a wide variety of

356
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:19,290
industries not just cybersecurity and

357
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:22,139
one of the ways that that shows up would

358
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:25,170
be a salad see a salary sorry a salary

359
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:26,999
disparity between men and women so is

360
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:30,149
this something that you've seen or

361
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:35,100
you've experienced at all over the time

362
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:36,720
that you've been in the industry so I'll

363
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,759
answer that question first Havok I

364
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,939
experienced it I would say no I haven't

365
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:44,009
experienced it and if I had ever concern

366
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:47,519
with any organization I would always

367
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:49,709
take it up with my hiring manager and HR

368
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,149
so I've been able to resolve all those

369
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:53,699
issues and I would encourage everyone

370
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:55,050
every woman who have who think there is

371
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:57,628
a disparity they should talk to their

372
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,878
hiring manager coming to the question

373
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:02,399
gentle in quality so I'll go back go to

374
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:06,720
a report which recently was not recently

375
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:09,379
I would say it was a 2017 study it was

376
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,519
done by IAC square in collaboration with

377
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:17,339
executive women forum and Center for

378
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:20,370
cyber safety and education this was a

379
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:23,699
study done and published in 2017 and it

380
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:25,790
had key five findings I'll talk about it

381
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:28,859
basically did that serve that surveyed

382
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:32,699
19,000 641 information security

383
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:34,860
professionals around 170 countries to

384
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:36,389
understand the trends and issues

385
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:40,199
affecting their profession and career

386
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:41,759
and the five key findings and I'll talk

387
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,040
about only four findings which are

388
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,079
relevant to our discussion today so

389
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,639
those findings are number one there are

390
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,929
only 11 percent women in information

391
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:53,339
security industry that's at that those

392
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:55,050
are less number than overall

393
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:58,709
representation of women and workforce

394
00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:01,889
our second key finding is that globally

395
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:04,049
men are four times higher than mode more

396
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:06,449
likely to hold c-level positions and

397
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:10,139
nine times more likely to hold

398
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:14,399
managerial positions third finding is

399
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:16,589
that 51% women report various form of in

400
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:18,379
discrimination in InfoSec industry and

401
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:20,780
the last

402
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:26,030
which relates the question you asked in

403
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:28,160
2007 2016 women aren't less than men at

404
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:31,970
all different levels in context of

405
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:35,920
enforcing industry so it is the de data

406
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:39,260
which suggests there is a problem and

407
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:42,230
now we have to solve this problem all

408
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:45,050
professionals organizations executives

409
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:47,090
hiring managers everyone have to

410
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:49,220
collectively address this problem and

411
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:51,169
when we talk about gender inequality

412
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:54,790
there are a couple of things going on

413
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:58,460
there so when I talk to some cecil's and

414
00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:00,379
some hiring managers sometime ask them

415
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,120
know what would you why don't you hire

416
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,640
them and more woman he said her faith we

417
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:07,969
don't have in file pipeline we don't get

418
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,580
cybersecurity candidates out there so

419
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:13,580
that is a problem and I think we need to

420
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:17,960
fix that problem and that has to fit we

421
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:19,310
fixed holistically and how to fix that I

422
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,350
think that's your question right how do

423
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:25,820
we address that how do we have more

424
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:28,399
women in cybersecurity so if we think or

425
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:31,939
address this problem holistically we

426
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,690
have to start from schools and there has

427
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:37,670
to be a very critical and what critical

428
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:41,170
is a collaboration between businesses

429
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:43,610
between a cadmium and between

430
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:45,620
universities like Andrew government's

431
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:48,800
that's extremely important so at school

432
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:52,189
level we need to have school boards and

433
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:54,680
schools creating optional cybersecurity

434
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:57,440
awareness courses for grade 11 and 12

435
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:59,720
students to attract those girls out

436
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,520
there to do take those courses for

437
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,410
example my son is in high school right

438
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,770
now he has optional courses computer

439
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:09,950
science he has accounting we can have a

440
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:12,920
cybersecurity course just to make help

441
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:15,170
them become better digital citizen they

442
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,300
have Ivy Knights in schools they can

443
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,770
have cybersecurity Knights in school so

444
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,560
there are many ways they can put the

445
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:23,780
programs in place to attract those young

446
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:28,129
girls to come into the cyber stew to

447
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:31,820
take those courses and and and also we

448
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:35,090
have to I believe educate educate

449
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:36,830
the career counselors to know to educate

450
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,289
those kids to guide those kids that

451
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,970
there is our courier which is called

452
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:43,399
cyber security and what does it entail

453
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:45,169
so that's where we can really address

454
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:47,330
that problem then we have to come to

455
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:49,519
universities and they're the businesses

456
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:52,100
have to really very strongly collaborate

457
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,409
with universities to send a word out

458
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,149
that it's not about technology cyber

459
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:58,820
security professional is profession is

460
00:19:56,149 --> 00:20:00,529
not all about technology and we have an

461
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,299
example here I was talking to Kimberly

462
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:04,549
here and I said I'll cut you

463
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:07,249
she is from economics back background

464
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:09,019
and she is in cybersecurity so whenever

465
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:10,369
I talk to someone and I introduce a

466
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:12,409
mastaba security professionals they say

467
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:16,039
oh my god you're a geek you know you're

468
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:18,049
pretty technical and I am but but there

469
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:19,879
are many opportunities we need people

470
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:22,908
with critical thinking skills we need

471
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:25,728
people with lawyers with cybersecurity

472
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:28,369
skill set so we need business good

473
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:30,320
auditors who can articulate well we need

474
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:32,478
good writing skills for writing policies

475
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,029
and standards so that message has to go

476
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:37,729
out to universities and colleges so that

477
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:40,279
students know what this entails and the

478
00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:41,749
last step I think I'm going overboard

479
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:43,820
right now

480
00:20:41,749 --> 00:20:45,759
the last step where we have to work the

481
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:49,729
last where we can tackle the situation

482
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:52,190
it were business as the organization's

483
00:20:49,729 --> 00:20:54,649
the hiring managers the executives they

484
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:56,809
have to develop programs to attract

485
00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:58,758
women to develop women and to retain

486
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:01,820
women in cybersecurity and I'll stop

487
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:04,849
there thank you her free so many points

488
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:11,989
in there but Rachel or Lauren like what

489
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:13,580
are your thoughts there she said I just

490
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:16,279
take it a little bit further and I think

491
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,739
in some ways some of the challenges

492
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:20,570
we're facing are not much different than

493
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:23,330
what for example the engineering

494
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:26,809
profession taste or the science

495
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:29,689
professions face is that we need to stop

496
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:32,349
stereotyping that females are good at

497
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:36,279
English and males are good at math and

498
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:40,279
sciences and because that's not true and

499
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:42,600
we we just need to stop doing that so

500
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:46,080
that we can start talking

501
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:49,110
- and right before their high school

502
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:53,820
that in public school we're starting to

503
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:56,939
socialize all genders that math and

504
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:59,189
sciences are equally as interesting as

505
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:02,509
the literature's and the soft sciences

506
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:07,190
and that there's really interesting

507
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:10,409
stuff and it's not geeky - like math and

508
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:14,490
which you know I was classified as a

509
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:18,809
geek because I like math but but that

510
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:22,110
it's cool and I think more we need to be

511
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:25,289
seen as panelists like this I noticed

512
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:29,070
that the ASE squared conference coming

513
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:32,220
up in Texas this fall for three of the

514
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:35,158
four keynote speakers are women so these

515
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:37,529
are subject matter experts that are not

516
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:40,909
geeks that are doing really cool stuff

517
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:45,059
and we need more role models like that

518
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:48,149
and that so we stopped looking at gender

519
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:50,570
and just start looking at expertise in

520
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:53,070
what interesting things are you doing

521
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:57,590
yeah so I'm supposed to come in after

522
00:22:53,070 --> 00:23:00,539
all of those really important so I um I

523
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:03,449
to go back to the the pay equity thing

524
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:06,120
so in some ways I feel like I might not

525
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:07,620
fit on this panel because at the

526
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,139
Commissioner's Office where I work

527
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:13,110
there's about 40 employees and I can

528
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:14,370
count the man on one hand so we are the

529
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:18,299
vast majority of the people in that

530
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:20,969
organization currently are women and so

531
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:23,820
in some so in terms of pay inequality I

532
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:25,759
would find that difficult to be able to

533
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,259
comment on I think and where I am today

534
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,419
where I've been in previous places in my

535
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:31,679
life yeah I can I can be pretty

536
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:33,960
comfortable in saying that there was

537
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,450
some pay inequality there but not

538
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,419
currently where I am and in terms of

539
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:41,070
just what you'd mentioned before about

540
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:43,919
there being gender inequality and having

541
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:46,168
different challenges in in the workplace

542
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,539
for women I really struggle with this as

543
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:50,730
a question and as something to talk

544
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:53,190
about but because I think I look at it

545
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:55,799
differently I think women have

546
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,520
challenges but I think men are missing

547
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:00,299
out

548
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:02,460
I think that when women are women may or

549
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,900
may not be passed over for an

550
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,330
opportunity because they're having

551
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,039
children they're taking time off they're

552
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:10,020
having a print they're taking parental

553
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:11,850
leave I think men are missing out men

554
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,679
should be feel as though they can take

555
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,090
parental leave as well and that they

556
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,010
won't be discriminated against because

557
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:20,399
they're taking parental leave so I think

558
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:23,600
there's this there's this there's this

559
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,890
need to kind of come together and and

560
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,840
support each other in both ways it's not

561
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:29,640
just that I'm not saying that women

562
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,350
aren't necessarily discriminated against

563
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,690
because they're taking parental leave in

564
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:36,959
my office that wouldn't make sense with

565
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:39,360
five men in the office but it just I

566
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,150
don't think it would work but but I do

567
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,889
think that there needs to be a change in

568
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,690
the way we look at things and we look

569
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,700
and say and all those men out there that

570
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:49,230
miss the opportunity to take parental

571
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,120
leave when you had small children or

572
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,770
you're thinking about doing it now what

573
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,289
an opportunity what a great time to

574
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:57,960
spend in your life right and if we

575
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:59,730
support men and men support women more I

576
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,380
think it's much more of a it's much more

577
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:03,840
of a two-way street and sometimes then

578
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:06,030
we we have the opportunity to to think

579
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,000
about it really get our head around do

580
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:12,840
we have any men in the audience who may

581
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:17,400
have taken a paternal leave at all oh

582
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:21,240
yeah we have quite a few all right it's

583
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:23,850
good it's I mean we don't want while we

584
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,580
talk about equality and women we don't

585
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:28,289
want to also make it unfair from men to

586
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:32,189
have the same kinds of experiences with

587
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:34,230
their families that we do right I think

588
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:36,510
about the fact that we should have

589
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:38,669
societies where you know an employer

590
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:40,830
doesn't say well I'm not gonna promote

591
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:43,650
this woman because she'll be off for 18

592
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:46,320
months or nine months I think that it

593
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:49,200
should be I wonder if you know if Harvin

594
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,299
that has a kid if will have to be

595
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,789
without him for nine months you know as

596
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,289
well it shouldn't just be you know about

597
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:58,020
the women but there was something that

598
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:59,460
you said Rachel that that popped a

599
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,520
question into my head he talked about

600
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:06,149
how at the privacy office its female

601
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,889
donnelly or its 50/50 right do you think

602
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:09,449
that

603
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:13,560
I think Lauren olia was talking about

604
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:15,480
how we a lot of times we tell girls

605
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,889
they'll be good

606
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,730
you know softer things maybe like

607
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:22,560
psychology or more nurturing type

608
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:26,550
professions do you think that there's a

609
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:29,790
reason why women are drawn maybe more to

610
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:33,149
privacy and compliance type roles as

611
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:34,680
opposed to see security or is there just

612
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:36,870
not enough data to support where I'm

613
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,970
going with this so I love this question

614
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,709
because those of you who know me and my

615
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:44,430
work life would know that it's not

616
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:47,430
nurturing to be privacy I am and that I

617
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:49,350
what I always say to those who work on

618
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:50,940
my team and and who work in privacy

619
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:53,040
generally is we're not in it to make

620
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:57,000
friends we're regulator right so it's

621
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:58,830
not it's not an opportunity to for that

622
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,580
nurturing environment I do think that

623
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:04,740
it's it's it's fascinating that it does

624
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:08,310
seem to be more female dominated at

625
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:10,530
least I would say in I would definitely

626
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:12,450
in my office there's far more women than

627
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,980
men and in Alberta and most of the

628
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,090
larger organizations that I work with

629
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,820
and actually many of the smaller

630
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:20,250
organizations as well they the privacy

631
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,110
officers are often women as well but it

632
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:26,570
probably evens out to be a bit more

633
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:28,679
50/50 outside of our office I don't I

634
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:30,870
suspect that it has something to do with

635
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:34,230
ours and availability in government and

636
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:35,760
traditionally women look for more of

637
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,980
those positions which are more 8:00 to

638
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,890
4:30 because of the family commitments

639
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,150
today I would say that if if that's the

640
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:44,100
reason why you're choosing a job then

641
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,300
you're making decisions in the wrong way

642
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,490
right and you should find an

643
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,260
organization that supports everybody

644
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:51,300
right and not just taking it for those

645
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,820
hours but I do find it interesting that

646
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:57,090
that at least in our office there's

647
00:27:53,820 --> 00:28:00,450
definitely more more women than men and

648
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:02,820
on my team specifically we do we do have

649
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,280
the the IT expertise and and we're

650
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,840
working to continue to build that

651
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:09,330
expertise as well so we definitely have

652
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,790
the the tech people on the team as well

653
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:13,470
but and my team maybe that's actually

654
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:16,590
you know what maybe that is interesting

655
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,670
because my team is more 5050 yeah men

656
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,709
and women but when you look at the

657
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:21,340
office we've got like five or six men

658
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:25,330
and 40 employee

659
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:26,770
so it's it's interesting I don't really

660
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:33,370
have an answer which is why I'm kind of

661
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:35,440
babbling no no that's fine I think there

662
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:38,100
was one point that came up her Preet

663
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:41,710
when when you were kind of talking there

664
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:43,570
in my own experience of being in

665
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:47,500
insecurity for the last few years and

666
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:49,629
then IT for last ten years I think it's

667
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:53,830
definitely always been a male-dominated

668
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:57,130
environment undergrad I think maybe over

669
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:59,560
a couple of goals my my classes even

670
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:02,830
when I did my master's program none of

671
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:05,050
my lecturers were female great and I

672
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:06,520
think as women sometimes it's important

673
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:08,409
for us to be able to see someone that

674
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:12,310
looks like us in the position that we

675
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:14,050
envision for ourselves and when I was

676
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:15,940
when I thought about putting the panel

677
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:19,600
together I thought it would probably be

678
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:23,950
nice to have a guy sitting here with us

679
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:26,649
to see how how they feel about these

680
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:28,000
issues that were talking about I don't

681
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:30,090
want to go off on a rant here right

682
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,190
yesterday I was talking to Michael

683
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:36,340
veiling and he mentioned that he was at

684
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:39,180
a conference some time ago and they had

685
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:42,399
a women in cybersecurity breakfast and

686
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:43,930
he said you know he walked by kind of

687
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,000
one of the organizers and she said you

688
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:49,420
know are you gonna come join us at the

689
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,140
breakfast and he said you know am I am I

690
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:54,880
invited because he was kind of like by

691
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,670
default he wasn't really sure if it was

692
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,310
something that men were included in that

693
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:03,520
discussion and so I my next question is

694
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:05,950
are we doing enough to engage not just

695
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,850
women in this conversation but also men

696
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:12,490
and is that necessary that we have men

697
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:14,199
help us champion champion this issue or

698
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,040
is it just something that we should be

699
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,750
doing

700
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:22,800
what can I start this one oh because I

701
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:26,040
have a dancer absolutely so my answer to

702
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:28,820
is can are we doing enough the answer is

703
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:31,830
absolutely not we're not we should have

704
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,178
whenever there's a gender issue we can't

705
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,169
just have one gender sitting here saying

706
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:35,250
we're gonna solve the problem because

707
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,860
we're not gonna solve the problem

708
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,920
without your help right we absolutely

709
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:42,419
need to engage men as much as we can and

710
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,460
and again an engaging men in the

711
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:46,260
conversation helps men to it helps

712
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,179
because I know and I've heard from men

713
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,730
saying while I could never I could never

714
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:53,100
take Matt Levi or parentally if I could

715
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,870
never do this I get frowned on if I'm

716
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,270
taking if I'm the one taking my my

717
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:59,459
daughter to the dentist appointments

718
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:01,350
definitely not right so I do think that

719
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,940
we absolutely need to engage men and we

720
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:07,230
need to understand their perspectives as

721
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:10,740
much as ours as well and and I think in

722
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:13,140
in your conversation yesterday I think

723
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,880
that it's it's really important that men

724
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,830
feel welcome when we have you know

725
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,840
opportunities to talk about women and in

726
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:21,210
cybersecurity and that they can share

727
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:27,449
their perspectives and vice versa as

728
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:30,000
well yeah this is not just women's

729
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:31,860
problem like when you look at you know

730
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,950
how we started off this conversation

731
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:39,090
that we've got this huge shortfall of

732
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:42,440
cybersecurity expertise that we're

733
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:46,139
facing and part of that shortfall is

734
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:48,870
over represented by a lack of women in

735
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:51,030
the industry that that shortfall is not

736
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:53,909
a woman's problem that's that's an

737
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:55,800
industry problem and we need to solve it

738
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:58,470
but beyond that it's also a social

739
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:03,178
problem is that the things that we're

740
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:06,870
talking about here are if we fix them it

741
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:09,929
fixes quality of life not just for women

742
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:11,639
but for the men who are partners and the

743
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:14,400
men that are part of our families and

744
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:17,640
the boys that are being raised by equal

745
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:21,120
men and women and it just improves the

746
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:24,390
quality of our society so this is a far

747
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:27,178
bigger you know you wanted to fix the

748
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:28,580
world this is one way that we can all

749
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:31,970
contribute to fixing

750
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:34,820
the world is by becoming far more aware

751
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:38,860
some of the subtle things that go on

752
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:43,158
that put women in their place and

753
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:45,678
sometimes it's not intended but we're

754
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:47,269
just not aware of it and sometimes it's

755
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,419
been pointed out to me and I've totally

756
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:52,820
missed that a comment could be taken as

757
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:55,279
offensive and that what it was

758
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:58,399
derogatory and could be perceived as

759
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,559
putting women down or putting somebody a

760
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,090
brace down or put it in and we need to

761
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,269
get better and more alert to those

762
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:08,000
things and fix them yeah I agree

763
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:10,580
any thoughts so the question that should

764
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,470
we include men I think we there's no

765
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:14,389
option because we don't have many women

766
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:17,899
out there we have hiring manager men we

767
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:19,729
have executive men way so they would

768
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:22,219
need to be included in this discussion

769
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,990
and I'll go back to research I do I want

770
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:27,950
to go back to data because data is

771
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:30,080
everything else right so if we see today

772
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:32,750
we have only 11 percent women that's 1

773
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,990
research what says one of the research

774
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:37,490
says the diversity if you see google lot

775
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,769
of researchers and diversity which are

776
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:43,250
happening quite a lot diverse diversity

777
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:45,740
is extremely important for increasing

778
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:47,960
the bottom line revenue of company and

779
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:50,980
they McKinsey had done a research and

780
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,899
they said companies which had more women

781
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:55,760
and gender diversity their revenue was

782
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:57,918
more than companies we didn't have women

783
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,990
so we have less women here in in for

784
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,200
secondary and we know that these two are

785
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:05,929
facts so what do we do what is the best

786
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,730
way to fill that gap I think we are

787
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:10,700
missing out on a talent pool unclear

788
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:13,250
which is sitting there and we can use it

789
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:16,089
but how to use it do you again it's

790
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:18,560
incumbent upon executives hiring manager

791
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:20,210
organizations to do more and that's what

792
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,389
yesterday my question was to see so

793
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:25,040
panel now it's upon the leaders to put

794
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:26,690
those programs in place I know it's

795
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,029
challenging it's not easy to do in

796
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:31,668
organizations but somebody have to take

797
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:33,889
that initiative to put those programs in

798
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:36,770
place to attract and develop internal

799
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:38,119
talent and I know in my organization

800
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:40,190
there are so many people who interface

801
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,919
with me in from business they are always

802
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,029
excited

803
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:43,649
what's going on in cybersecurity

804
00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:46,199
Harpreet what kind of incident we had

805
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:48,808
what happened they will like to share

806
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:50,489
with me some of the you know stories

807
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:52,049
going out there which I'm already aware

808
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:54,229
because I keep myself up to date on

809
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:56,668
what's going on in threat landscape but

810
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:58,680
so you can gauge that that they are

811
00:34:56,668 --> 00:35:00,509
interested in cyber security and they

812
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,950
have out-of-the-box thinking skills so

813
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:04,079
obviously if there is a leader out there

814
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:06,509
they can develop those internal talent

815
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,089
anything that's really very important

816
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:11,279
which will help us in a long term

817
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:13,078
because this is a global problem and

818
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:15,720
it's going to bite us if we don't act

819
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:17,940
towards that so obviously men have to be

820
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,759
engaged in discuss this question yeah um

821
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:25,769
when as you guys are talking there's a

822
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:28,799
saying give a man a fish feed him for a

823
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:31,740
day teach a man to fish you know feed

824
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:35,038
him for life but I thought what if what

825
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:37,259
if we were to throw women into that and

826
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:40,049
I thought if you give a woman a fish

827
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:43,650
she'll feed her family and I'm not being

828
00:35:40,049 --> 00:35:46,500
biased right if you teach a woman to

829
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:51,089
fish you empower the entire family like

830
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:53,849
research shows us that women when we

831
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:56,009
empower women and when we allow them to

832
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:58,589
be you know contributors in our society

833
00:35:56,009 --> 00:36:01,710
economically that you empower the entire

834
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:04,019
society right so just something that

835
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:07,769
kind of popped into my mind as you guys

836
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:10,109
are talking we've talked a lot about the

837
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:12,149
challenges but as we kind of wind this

838
00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:15,000
wine this down and we want to talk a

839
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:19,140
little bit about solutions can you

840
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,480
comment on triumph or you know just just

841
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:27,089
uh some times that you've had so far in

842
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:34,799
your career encouragement yep I'll give

843
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:42,210
you a minute to think about it yes my

844
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:44,579
book is rather than talk about trance

845
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:46,079
because I because I've had a lot of high

846
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:48,809
points through my career I'm gonna talk

847
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,220
about why I had those high points and

848
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:55,030
and what enabled them

849
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:57,939
and you know I can credit my parents for

850
00:36:55,030 --> 00:37:01,030
you know raising a smart girl but beyond

851
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:03,190
that I've had some incredible mentors

852
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:04,810
and some of them formal mentorship and

853
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:07,030
some of them informal mentorship

854
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:09,970
mentorship but I've had incredible

855
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:12,369
mentors throughout my career that have

856
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:19,529
helped me by asking me tough questions

857
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:23,109
at times and by guiding me and and so

858
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:26,830
that has certainly enabled me to do some

859
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:29,170
really fun stuff with my career but the

860
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:31,630
other piece of that is that I have

861
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:34,060
become a mentor and both formerly with

862
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:38,349
the U of A MBA program but also

863
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:41,710
informally I you know I like mentoring I

864
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:44,859
like growing people and and helping

865
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:47,800
people grow and so I think more of us

866
00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:51,460
need to do that more there are so many

867
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:53,890
opportunities if you grab them to just

868
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:56,470
help somebody by asking them a tough

869
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:58,540
question sometimes by pointing out that

870
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:00,580
perhaps their approach was not the best

871
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:03,279
and helping them think about how could

872
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:06,279
they do it differently the next time not

873
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,700
in a derogatory manner but in a manner

874
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:11,680
to help them learn and I think if my

875
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,598
mentors have taught me anything they've

876
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,060
taught me to appreciate that kind of

877
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,900
approach and to pass it on and and I

878
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:22,089
think if I look back over my career

879
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:28,109
that's probably the one thing that I

880
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:30,700
really say is it has been a huge

881
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:32,650
accomplishment on my part is that I've

882
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:35,819
helped individuals and organizations

883
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:38,010
change and grow and that's been fun

884
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:42,490
that's awesome

885
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:46,540
Rachel so I've also had some really

886
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:49,959
incredible opportunities some great

887
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:51,460
challenges presented to me and great

888
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,830
support and helping reach some of those

889
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,050
I think what I'd like to touch on is

890
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:58,420
what you mentioned when you were

891
00:38:55,050 --> 00:39:00,730
providing that brief bio where I had it

892
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,859
was my first offense investigation we do

893
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,540
have regulatory investigations as a

894
00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:06,310
small piece of what my team

895
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:08,350
and it was my very first one that I had

896
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:10,570
done and it resulted in 38 charges and

897
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:15,850
it was it ended up becoming this massive

898
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:17,650
investigation that was way out of my the

899
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:19,330
normal work that I do especially when it

900
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:21,070
ends up resulting in criminal charges

901
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:25,440
which is not something we we deal with

902
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:28,510
right so it was it was far beyond what I

903
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,460
felt comfortable doing but I rose to the

904
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:32,290
challenge and I got the work done and

905
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,820
and I do think that a lot of that

906
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:35,259
triumph comes from the fact that I had a

907
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:37,120
lot of support from the people that I

908
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:39,490
needed it my boss at the time who

909
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:42,160
happens to be in the room was very

910
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:44,529
supportive of me and kind of just let me

911
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,089
go with the with the investigation and I

912
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:47,590
would go to him and I would say okay

913
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:49,720
this is what we found so far do we still

914
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:52,690
need to go down here and and it was very

915
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,790
supportive and encouraging me to get to

916
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:57,820
that point and so I do see that as being

917
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:59,620
a high point in my career but it was

918
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:01,120
because I had all that I had that

919
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,950
support and I had somebody that I felt

920
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,480
like I could trust when I was entering a

921
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:07,270
territory that the office hadn't entered

922
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,630
before and that and that I certainly

923
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:12,970
hadn't before so I don't think that my

924
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:14,980
the triumphs in my career and I would

925
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:16,870
say for most or all of them are really

926
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:19,480
based on having that support around me

927
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:22,450
as well and that trust of those people

928
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:25,930
that I know that they've got my back has

929
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:27,669
really helped to to solidify what those

930
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:31,720
challenges were or those those triumphs

931
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:35,140
were I should say I prayed I would say

932
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:37,859
many times again my entire tenure Kenny

933
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:42,040
or journey in Canada has been a tribe I

934
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:44,800
worked on some major cybersecurity

935
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:47,080
projects or initiatives I would say with

936
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,600
me with some organizations and that

937
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:51,190
increased the security maturity and that

938
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:54,310
really gives the results that satisfying

939
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:57,910
feeling that's a triumph balancing that

940
00:40:54,310 --> 00:41:00,310
family commitment with work life and

941
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:02,649
raising a healthy family you know all

942
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:06,220
along the way it has been a triumph so

943
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:08,560
overall I would say I see every

944
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:10,120
challenge as an opportunity learn from

945
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,700
it and then you have that feeling inside

946
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,529
oh I could do it so that itself as a

947
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,450
child I have been able to build great

948
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:18,230
relationship both within and outside my

949
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:20,330
organization with great leaders and

950
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:22,910
great role models I consider it a big

951
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:24,830
tribe and I would encourage everyone

952
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:26,899
like young people out here who are

953
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:29,060
entering in this field associate with

954
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:31,940
the people you want to be like you know

955
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:33,890
the leaders are Network more and try to

956
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:36,320
connect to just go for coffee with them

957
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:37,640
say I would like to be like you you know

958
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,670
I want to learn from you

959
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:43,940
so I believe that it has been a bigger

960
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:46,310
part associating with with the people I

961
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:47,780
wanted to be like with the great leaders

962
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:50,540
and role model so I would say natural

963
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:52,280
many times whichever is louder alright

964
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:55,100
one of the things I think that came

965
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:57,590
through in all of your answers would

966
00:41:55,100 --> 00:42:01,069
probably be mentorship right you all

967
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:04,880
mentioned that in some way I don't know

968
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:06,830
I think I see a lot of young faces like

969
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,630
student faces I've interacted with a few

970
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:09,980
people in the audience and I know that

971
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:14,090
some people are just getting started in

972
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:17,930
their careers how do we how do we tap

973
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:19,730
into those networks right as as

974
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:24,040
professional women you've all been in

975
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:26,570
the industry for over a decade you know

976
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:29,600
do you have time like how do you find

977
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:31,130
time for a mentorship with everything

978
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,290
else that you have going on

979
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:36,530
right full-stop that's the first

980
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:39,140
question I guess and then how how would

981
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:41,240
a young person or you know someone just

982
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:46,790
getting into the industry tap into that

983
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:48,919
to be able to connect with mentors I'm

984
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:52,550
gonna I'm gonna start this one is I'm

985
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:57,250
gonna start by pointing out that my

986
00:42:52,550 --> 00:43:00,950
mentors as I look back over my history

987
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:02,930
really have they've not been female and

988
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:10,129
one of the one of the cool things about

989
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:11,569
engaging a male as a mentor is that they

990
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,070
all the sudden are engaged in

991
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:15,260
understanding your problems and your

992
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:19,850
challenges and helping you address them

993
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:22,880
so one so as a female looking for

994
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:24,650
someone to mentor do not think that it

995
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,959
should only be a woman

996
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:30,529
in fact you may further your cause by

997
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:33,049
choosing a male who can be an

998
00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:34,939
extraordinary mentor to you the second

999
00:43:33,049 --> 00:43:37,459
thing is that meant being a mentor

1000
00:43:34,939 --> 00:43:38,660
doesn't mean that you're getting a

1001
00:43:37,459 --> 00:43:40,609
mentor doesn't mean that you're gonna

1002
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:42,078
have somebody solve your problem it

1003
00:43:40,609 --> 00:43:45,229
means you're gonna have somebody who

1004
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,939
maybe in a very short conversation asks

1005
00:43:45,229 --> 00:43:49,430
you a couple tough questions and sends

1006
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:51,799
you a way to think about them so it

1007
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:55,219
isn't necessarily time-consuming

1008
00:43:51,799 --> 00:43:57,288
although it does take time but the other

1009
00:43:55,219 --> 00:44:01,519
part of that is as a mentor it's very

1010
00:43:57,289 --> 00:44:03,439
rewarding so and I've never had a

1011
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:05,390
mentorship relationship where I'm

1012
00:44:03,439 --> 00:44:07,788
mentoring where I haven't learned a ton

1013
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:09,949
and it hasn't caused me to stop and

1014
00:44:07,789 --> 00:44:13,519
reflect on how am i engaging and how am

1015
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:16,039
i learning and what am i doing so it's

1016
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:18,078
it's a it's a two-way street

1017
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:20,719
you know there's benefit for both

1018
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:23,809
parties and and if you don't enter into

1019
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:26,829
the relationship thinking that way then

1020
00:44:23,809 --> 00:44:31,339
you're not gonna get as much out of it

1021
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:33,410
yeah I mean I I would like to add her

1022
00:44:31,339 --> 00:44:36,400
and 100% agree with what Lauren said I

1023
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:39,170
think mentors are very important for

1024
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,880
learning more and solving some of the

1025
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:42,650
problems because they will not solve

1026
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,390
your problem but they will kind of ask

1027
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:46,939
those questions what exactly she said

1028
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:49,129
and I would encourage all those young

1029
00:44:46,939 --> 00:44:51,769
people out here who are just entering

1030
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:54,410
them to see this field to find a mentor

1031
00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:56,359
you can find it through LinkedIn you are

1032
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:58,249
coming to these conferences if you like

1033
00:44:56,359 --> 00:44:59,660
someone strike a conversation and talk

1034
00:44:58,249 --> 00:45:01,698
to them about it

1035
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:04,399
there are Asaka conferences any

1036
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:07,670
conferences you can get hands on you're

1037
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,890
able to come to you you are fail and and

1038
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:12,829
talk to any professor you know just send

1039
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:15,308
them an email and I have seen being my

1040
00:45:12,829 --> 00:45:18,769
experience in Canada people are so good

1041
00:45:15,309 --> 00:45:21,769
they respond to your emails and whoever

1042
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:24,140
I have tried to connect to to ask a

1043
00:45:21,769 --> 00:45:26,118
question they have already always

1044
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:28,069
responded to me so never if somebody

1045
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:29,660
doesn't respond don't hold don't worry

1046
00:45:28,069 --> 00:45:32,509
about it there'll be next person who

1047
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:34,729
will respond so always go ahead and find

1048
00:45:32,509 --> 00:45:36,920
a person you can associate with who is

1049
00:45:34,729 --> 00:45:39,740
already there and can

1050
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,300
help you out so mentoring is the key I

1051
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:43,759
would hundred percent agree with what

1052
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:47,450
lemon said Rachel so I'm gonna take this

1053
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:50,330
in a different direction a little bit

1054
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:51,890
and I give you a personal story about

1055
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,509
the power of mentorship I've had a

1056
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:56,480
number of mentors I would say they were

1057
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:58,130
all pretty informal I saw them as a

1058
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,460
mentor they may not have realized that I

1059
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:03,200
was I felt that relationship but when I

1060
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:05,630
was back at the government of Manitoba

1061
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,520
many years ago the assistant deputy

1062
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:09,530
minister at the time his name was robear

1063
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,450
Gregg and I encourage you all to google

1064
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:15,230
him he was a brilliant man he's passed

1065
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:17,270
away many years ago now but and I looked

1066
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:20,270
up to him I went to him with all of my

1067
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:22,820
all of my my issues as being new into

1068
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:25,070
the the workforce and and trying to

1069
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:27,620
navigate a lot of a lot of unknown

1070
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:29,510
territory for me and also I was still my

1071
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,310
masters in public administration which

1072
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:33,040
did not prepare me for you know IT

1073
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:36,259
governance right so I was trying to

1074
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:39,470
navigate that as well and he was he was

1075
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:41,330
a fabulous man and he the day I left the

1076
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,520
government of Manitoba he wasn't he was

1077
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:45,650
in a meeting with a couple of ministers

1078
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,870
he wasn't able to be there and he sent

1079
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:51,020
me an email apologizing for not being

1080
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:53,330
there and the context of the email was

1081
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:55,430
that he'd sort of seen me grow over the

1082
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:57,500
time I was there and pointed out some of

1083
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:59,419
my strengths and stuff like that I still

1084
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,920
have that email to this day and there

1085
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:03,110
are days where I come home and I'm like

1086
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:05,780
oh I've had a horrible day I'm horrible

1087
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:07,820
at my job I give up right I need to find

1088
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:10,640
a new career in landscaping or something

1089
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:12,410
else right and it don't work and then

1090
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,299
but I look at that I still look at that

1091
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:16,339
email it's all right it's in my jewelry

1092
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:18,170
box and it and it still gives me that

1093
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,690
power and that strength to say you know

1094
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:23,390
what I believed in that man he was a

1095
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:26,630
brilliant man and he believed in me and

1096
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:28,609
so there's there's power in that and I

1097
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:30,320
do think that even if even if it's an

1098
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:32,720
informal relationship rather than a

1099
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,610
formal relationship there's you know a

1100
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,040
formal mentee mentor relationship

1101
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:38,630
there's power in in working with with

1102
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,759
people and helping to encourage their

1103
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:43,460
careers grow and you remember them I

1104
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:45,320
mean this was several years ago when I

1105
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:47,600
graduated from my my master's program

1106
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:51,150
and I keep that with me

1107
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:53,610
thanks Thomas do we have time for a

1108
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:55,380
couple of yeah certainly we definitely

1109
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:57,510

1110
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,920
thank you panelists um they've just with

1111
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:14,790
a show of hands does anybody have any

1112
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:17,610
questions for the panel having discuss

1113
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:20,940
about the inequality and challenges that

1114
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:24,630
women face in technology I I want you to

1115
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:27,080
know if you have any mentorship programs

1116
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:29,610
or workshops in your respective

1117
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,049
organizations or like if not already

1118
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:36,060
there if there's anything you would like

1119
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:38,130
to any share in your organization in my

1120
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:42,390
organization we have mentorship program

1121
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:43,740
but not for cybersecurity so there are

1122
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:46,560
many organizations out there like

1123
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:48,240
Deloitte I have a mentorship program

1124
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:54,000
Rachel I think your vote for the Lord

1125
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:56,189
right I did okay the reason I'm

1126
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,770
mentioning Deloitte we when I came new

1127
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:01,320
to Canada I was desperate for the job I

1128
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:03,570
wanted to work in right so I was looking

1129
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:05,660
for avenues where I can really network

1130
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:09,680
with people and there was a Deloitte

1131
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:12,569
women workshop where they were going to

1132
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:15,270
there'll be women leaders out there and

1133
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:16,770
they will talk to you and they will

1134
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:18,240
there will spend five minutes with you

1135
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:20,640
one women and then tracking them and

1136
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,229
then they you keep going like that so

1137
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,359
there are some organization where those

1138
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:27,090
programs are there but they open it up

1139
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:31,050
to other you know external people so

1140
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:33,990
keep an eye on that research search out

1141
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:35,520
on Google and on those companies and I

1142
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:37,439
think it's extremely important for

1143
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,780
organization to have those programs and

1144
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,790
again and again I say you know it's

1145
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:45,000
important executives and hiring managers

1146
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:46,800
and organizations have these programs in

1147
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,630
place so that's what I mean whenever I

1148
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,610
say that so we should have those

1149
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:52,920
programs but in my organization for

1150
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:54,810
cybersecurity we don't have that but I

1151
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,640
whenever somebody reaches out to me on

1152
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:59,190
Linton and people have reached out to me

1153
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,250
from Australia from US students doing

1154
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:02,470
masters and

1155
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:04,240
more about cybersecurity I have always

1156
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:05,799
responded to them I've tried to

1157
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,379
encourage them and answer their

1158
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:11,640
questions so I think right now online

1159
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:14,560
information and ability to connect

1160
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:16,150
geographically is huge so you can really

1161
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:21,940
take advantage of that

1162
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:24,790
thanks I'm great thank you

1163
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:27,720
I'll stand up for this one my name's

1164
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:30,250
Chris Hammond Thrasher and I'm the

1165
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:34,839
security consulting practice lead for

1166
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:39,420
Canada for Fujitsu consulting and my

1167
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:41,860
organization is formerly committed to

1168
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:45,310
diversity when it comes to hiring and

1169
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:48,670
promoting practices but I wanted to say

1170
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:52,420
that we're hiring now and we've been

1171
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:53,800
hiring for ever since I joined the cyber

1172
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:55,060
security business unit I've been with

1173
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:59,050
the company for years but I've been with

1174
00:50:55,060 --> 00:51:01,480
cyber security for two years and we've

1175
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:04,330
been looking for intermediate and senior

1176
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:07,690
cyber security consultants and we have

1177
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:09,940
yet to have a single female applicant so

1178
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:15,130
if you fit that bill and you're looking

1179
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:17,110
for work come come chase me down but

1180
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:17,980
yeah I mean some things something's

1181
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:20,440
wrong out there

1182
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:22,920
right that we all need to work together

1183
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,920
to fix

1184
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:35,069
yeah there's this one more wait at the

1185
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:37,560
top I think we can fit one more in set a

1186
00:51:35,069 --> 00:51:40,440
question about mentorship you mentioned

1187
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:42,960
that you will some people can sometimes

1188
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:46,980
look outside of their organization for

1189
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:49,710
mentorship and that has the benefit of

1190
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:51,300
connecting you to people you know if

1191
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:52,349
you're looking for a female mentor you

1192
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,420
can find that outside of your

1193
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:56,790
organization maybe easier than you can

1194
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:59,490
inside or if there's a skill set or a

1195
00:51:56,790 --> 00:52:01,109
role you can seek them seek them out

1196
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:05,220
outside of your organization do you have

1197
00:52:01,109 --> 00:52:07,098
any tips for people looking outside of

1198
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:10,470
their organization for Mentors

1199
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:12,900
specifically around the dice eNOS of the

1200
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:15,290
subject matter that we deal with like in

1201
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:18,089
privacy if you're dealing with a very

1202
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:19,410
legal problem it might be difficult to

1203
00:52:18,089 --> 00:52:22,890
discuss that outside of your

1204
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:35,250
organization legally so we need any

1205
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:36,868
suggestions for how to pursue that no I

1206
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:38,790
do think it's a really good question

1207
00:52:36,869 --> 00:52:40,770
because when we were talking before

1208
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:43,470
today about what this panel would look

1209
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:46,530
like I said it's hard for me as as

1210
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:48,450
somebody who works for regulator to to

1211
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:52,020
mentor because I can't be seen as

1212
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:55,140
providing advice right so we do struggle

1213
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:57,450
with that I do struggle with that my

1214
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:58,980
advice would be that and this is going

1215
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:01,379
to sound like a cop-out from a regulator

1216
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:03,089
but I generally provide more general

1217
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,380
advice that's able generally speaking if

1218
00:53:03,089 --> 00:53:06,450
you're experiencing a lot of ransomware

1219
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:10,560
you you may want to consider it right

1220
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:12,629
and and I'm a little bit more careful in

1221
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,759
my wording but I think that generally

1222
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:16,710
speaking for an organization like my

1223
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,420
office for 40 people there's not a lot

1224
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:20,520
of room for big mentorship programs

1225
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:23,670
right and most people who work there are

1226
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:25,170
at an intermediate or senior level

1227
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:27,089
already so people new to the

1228
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:28,920
organization or looking for a bit of a

1229
00:53:27,089 --> 00:53:31,259
career change there's not a lot of that

1230
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,849
opportunity there so so you are like

1231
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:36,049
people are looking from outside our

1232
00:53:32,849 --> 00:53:37,849
organization in so I think that in

1233
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:41,660
like this so when there's opportunities

1234
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:45,199
to network here there's I'm betting that

1235
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:46,819
what was it called this something that's

1236
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:51,019
a great opportunity to look for people

1237
00:53:46,819 --> 00:53:52,849
to to work with and mentor and privacy

1238
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:54,589
has this this group that meets a couple

1239
00:53:52,849 --> 00:53:56,390
times a year called privacy after-hours

1240
00:53:54,589 --> 00:53:59,630
it's through I up I know it's got kind

1241
00:53:56,390 --> 00:54:00,979
of a funny name but but you know like

1242
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:02,689
there's opportunities like that you look

1243
00:54:00,979 --> 00:54:03,828
outside and then as long as you're

1244
00:54:02,689 --> 00:54:05,749
careful and it's that one-on-one

1245
00:54:03,829 --> 00:54:08,929
relationship and that the person's not

1246
00:54:05,749 --> 00:54:10,578
providing you a direct advice like and

1247
00:54:08,929 --> 00:54:12,289
you're not writing it down saying Rachel

1248
00:54:10,579 --> 00:54:14,359
said to do this I think it's probably

1249
00:54:12,289 --> 00:54:16,039
gonna be okay but you it's a it's a

1250
00:54:14,359 --> 00:54:17,179
really good point that it does make

1251
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:18,469
sometimes for some of those

1252
00:54:17,179 --> 00:54:21,229
conversations to be a little bit more

1253
00:54:18,469 --> 00:54:22,789
difficult and complex so I'm just gonna

1254
00:54:21,229 --> 00:54:25,069
jump in with two things is that

1255
00:54:22,789 --> 00:54:28,660
mentorship doesn't always have to be a

1256
00:54:25,069 --> 00:54:31,519
formal established relationship is that

1257
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:34,670
I've been mentored and I have mentored

1258
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:36,229
people on a one-time basis with a quick

1259
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:37,969
conversation and I've had other

1260
00:54:36,229 --> 00:54:39,769
relationships that are ongoing for many

1261
00:54:37,969 --> 00:54:42,559
years where we've never actually talked

1262
00:54:39,769 --> 00:54:46,488
about you know the fact that somebody

1263
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:48,439
was a mentor to me but in all cases a

1264
00:54:46,489 --> 00:54:50,660
really great mentor is not going to

1265
00:54:48,439 --> 00:54:52,969
solve your problem or not even going to

1266
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:57,920
give you solutions they're just gonna

1267
00:54:52,969 --> 00:55:00,949
ask you really good questions so and

1268
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,900
have you go think about them and you may

1269
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:05,479
come back and bounce ideas and they may

1270
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:07,130
go yeah that sounds sense sound but and

1271
00:55:05,479 --> 00:55:08,509
that's something because I've gone

1272
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:11,029
through formal mentorship training

1273
00:55:08,509 --> 00:55:14,150
that's something that is really

1274
00:55:11,029 --> 00:55:16,160
underscored is that it's not the mentors

1275
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:19,339
job to provide you with the solution

1276
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,808
we're just there to help you come up

1277
00:55:19,339 --> 00:55:23,828
with the solution that you really have

1278
00:55:20,809 --> 00:55:26,599
you just haven't discovered it yet

1279
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:29,390
alright I think we're definitely at a

1280
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:31,939
time thank you so much ladies yeah so

1281
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:34,489
just a quick story before we finish the

1282
00:55:31,939 --> 00:55:37,160
panel we've heard a lot about mentorship

1283
00:55:34,489 --> 00:55:39,140
we heard a lot about finding sort of the

1284
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,640
union between information security and

1285
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:43,190
privacy so tenure

1286
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:46,279
ago I worked at a professional services

1287
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:48,010
firm and I worked on digital the digital

1288
00:55:46,279 --> 00:55:52,130
forensics site and I had an opportunity

1289
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:54,019
to apply it a position at a public

1290
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:55,880
entity but it was in within the

1291
00:55:54,019 --> 00:55:58,299
information security and privacy office

1292
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:01,160
so I felt a little bit out of my element

1293
00:55:58,299 --> 00:56:02,779
I didn't know really know what to do

1294
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:07,220
but I wanted to do really well at the

1295
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:09,950
interview so Rachel and I went to second

1296
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:12,140
cup in Manulife place and in the 45

1297
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:13,069
minutes that we had a talk I said tell

1298
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:15,589
me everything that you know about

1299
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:17,950
privacy I really want to a sis interview

1300
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:20,328
so we talked about community I

1301
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:24,439
interviewed I always see with Brent and

1302

1304
00:56:26,359 --> 00:56:29,529
today so thank you Rachel
