141

teo nakeesha the b-side's empty planning

144
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,440
committee it takes a crazy amount of

145
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,960
effort to pull these kind of things off

146
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,560
and the easier answer would have been to

147
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,000
just cancel it but instead they chose to

148
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,440
do the hard work and adapt to our

149
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,720
ever-changing world

150
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,199

152
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,280
psychologist or a physician

153
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,880
i'm not a natural leader i'm not a

154
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,638
natural communicative presenter writer

155
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,960
or magician i'm a nerd from the

156
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,639
born in the 1970s like to think of

157
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,080
myself as a pretty solid technology

158
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,960
delivery professional and decent of

159
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,800
hacker but

160
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,880
as my career grew i came across some

161
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,880
real skill and hackers dudes like

162
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,000
tavis almandie marcus hutchins tj

163
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,039
o'leary

164
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,320
he's in the chat i decided

165
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,400
you know i wasn't a good enough nerd to

166
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,080
like really get paid

167
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,520
i realized it didn't matter if i was the

168
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,359
smartest dude in the room or the dumbest

169
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,799
i sucked at getting my point across

170
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,720
so it didn't matter either way i took

171
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,320
this realization as an opportunity to

172
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,759
learn as much as i could about people

173
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,000
and there's no better industry than

174
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,840
infosec this community to learn about

175
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,600
people social engineering right i love

176
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,039
hacking but i figured any improvements

177
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,680
in my career would require

178
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,680
human hacking and mostly hacking myself

179
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,240
it was a challenge i really wanted for

180
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,319
myself

181
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,440
and resulted in many many cringe-worthy

182
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,880
events

183
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,120
but i'll keep persisting because i think

184
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,919
it's important for me and i see venues

185
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,479
like this

186
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,440
and i've you know learned an incredible

187
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,758
amount along the way

188
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,199
and if i can offer you something from my

189
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,280
learnings for your toolkit

190
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,960
great i'll encourage you too there's no

191
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,400
more supportive environment than b-sides

192
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,919
this is your place to show

193
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,198
us the things that you've learned along

194
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,799
the way to help with your journeys too

195
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,240
oh yes everybody wants cookies uh i wish

196
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,759
we were all together i would share my

197
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,039
cookies i would literally bring all the

198
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,800
cookies

199
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,159
um so anyways in my decades on this

200
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,400
planet i've never encountered anything

201
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,440
like this worldwide crisis response to

202
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,000
covet 19 pandemic but it really did show

203
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,919
me that

204
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,080
most incident response phases and

205
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,280
processes tend to be very similar over

206
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,318
time um apt comparison

207
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,599
would be something like well 9 11. i

208
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,599
remember

209
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,960
you know everybody who was alive at the

210
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,280
time kind of remembers where they were

211
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,198
at the time

212
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,799
a couple of jerks or a handful of jerks

213
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,520
slammed a couple of planes into the

214
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,919
ground and into a couple of buildings

215
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,680
um looking at the bad stuff versus time

216
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,960
graph that i made in ms paint as we

217
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,680
climbed the dark red

218
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,039
the world was starting to react to the

219
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,720
report of an attack

220
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,960
at the top of the red we kind of know as

221
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,800
much as there is to know all the planes

222
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,239
are down the towers are down there's a

223
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,840
hole in the pentagon an incredible

224
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,840
amount of innocent people have died

225
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,359
tracking the red down to the right and

226
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,359
approaching the orange air traffic has

227
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,960
ceased worldwide billions of people are

228
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,199
turning into the news

229
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,159
in the orange we're trying to make sense

230
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,840
of the attacks

231
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,879
uh air spaces are secured around the

232
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,318
planet we've got people on the ground

233
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,919
looking for survivors

234
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,599
as we move into the yellow we're

235
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,120
clearing rubble and we're

236
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,639
building or adapting to new security

237
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,400
regulations

238
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,840
for our pandemic it was the third week

239
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,400
of march things started to get funny

240
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,638
right

241
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,878
uh we sent everybody home intersecting

242
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,720
which is the kind of the top of the red

243
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,120
everybody tried to get used to working

244
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,879
from schooling and working from home

245
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,720
as we kind of started going down the

246
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,720
slope and into the orange again

247
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,560
and then as we hit the orange school and

248
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,680
work obligations shifted from everybody

249
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,840
go home and don't die

250
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,879
to uh oh yeah we still have some lives

251
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,440
to live

252
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,879
and you know businesses to run uh and

253
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,319
eight months later

254
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,680
as we circle down the the yellow we're

255
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,960
still trying to figure out who we are in

256
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,560
this new apoc

257
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,919
uh through each of these different

258
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,279
phases we feel different levels of

259
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,199
stress and different kinds of

260
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,120
communication different urgency

261
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,120
different needs for for the messages

262
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,799
that we need to get across

263
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,399
so let me get on with a little bit of

264
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,640
that here

265
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,640
um

266
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,719
oh look i can see my other screen that's

267
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,359
fantastic that's really cool

268
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,880
um let's take a minute to recognize the

269
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,720
complexities of interpersonal

270
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,240
communication right there's lots of

271
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,680
books on it um

272
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,519
i'm kind of picking and choosing some of

273
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,199
my favorite parts i i think it's

274
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,080
important to kind of do an analysis of

275
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,519
this first just to

276
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,360
just kind of put things in perspective

277
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,120
of of some of the

278
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,959
challenges that we actually face why

279
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,480
communication can be hard especially

280
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:18,239
when we're stressed the hell out um

281
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,959
in in this case here i'm the sender

282
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,080
and i click there okay there we go uh

283
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,518
and

284
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,160
i'm jumping over a cubicle to chastise

285
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,680
dave

286
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,680
and we'll call him dave because that's

287
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,439
his name beautiful human being actually

288
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,399
knows a lot of taekwondo and bjj and

289
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,800
could legit

290
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,160
destroy me if i actually did climb over

291
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,920
the cube in a nasty way

292
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,600
i'm the sender and i'm falling into a

293
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,120
trap here though i'm always right and

294
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,279
everybody should know the things that i

295
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,320
know and value the things that i do

296
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,160
right dangers of projecting as a sender

297
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,240
well tell more about that in i think two

298
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,360
slides if you've heard about me talk

299
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,959
about the buckets though part of my

300
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,480
coping mechanism during crisis to

301
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,479
consider the things tend to fall into

302
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,160
one of two buckets things i can control

303
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
or in one things i can't control on the

304
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,640
other

305
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,720
if i focus on the things i can control

306
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,640
the likelihood of reaching successful

307
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,040
communication goals is much higher in

308
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,760
this case as the sender so much rides on

309
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,680
me

310
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,160
uh in my picture i can't control the

311
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,839
receiver but i can have hope that dave

312
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,360
is using active listening skills

313
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,040
listening with the attempt to understand

314
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,279
the messages i the sender intend to

315
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,680
deliver it dave doesn't have to agree

316
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,200
he doesn't have to agree with me a good

317
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,239
listener suspends judgment though and

318
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,920
biases

319
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,839
until there's any reason to actually

320
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,279
have it as a listener

321
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,200
we want to do our best to understand

322
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,560
what the sender's trying to tell us

323
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,399
what am i trying to get across the

324
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,680
message there's a message obviously that

325
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,079
i'm trying to get across

326
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,359
the information i'm flinging at dave and

327
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,319
it has a pile of

328
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,839
different parts in it encoding even just

329
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,360
speaking the sentence i'm encoding a

330
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,440
message in canadian english

331
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,040
we can encode things in python then for

332
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,760
some reason because an employer told us

333
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,880
to

334
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,920
re encode it to javascript so consider

335
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,160
that kind of thing

336
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,000
with empathy when speaking to someone

337
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,000
with a heavy accent they're parallel

338
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,600
encoding decoding in their head while

339
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,680
you're yammering

340
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,399
right now we're also using tcp ospf tls

341
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,760
and so many

342
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,560
opportunities for everything to turn to

343
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,959
crap and we haven't even started talking

344
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,279
about

345
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,719
the the verbals and the verbals are

346
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,160
pretty simple it's just the words we

347
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,880
choose right

348
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,480
um social engineering's famous for

349
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,920
studying non-verbals and you'll see all

350
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,839
sorts of percentages that people toss

351
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,560
around out there to say oh 86 percent of

352
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,680
a message

353
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,279
i don't know how they're quantifying any

354
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,399
of that crap the reality is though that

355
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,920
non-verbals

356
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:35,519
are are very very key

357
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,319
um it's a lot of the message and they're

358
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,160
key

359
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,839
more so because of the consistency

360
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,360
required between verbals non-verbals and

361
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,440
encoding uh if you can see my face

362
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,160
if you're if you're watching the stream

363
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,160
let me try this

364
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,920
i'm not mad

365
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,360
or

366
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:04,160
i'm not mad it's

367
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,000
inconsistencies are are they stick out

368
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,800
with a blinking light to most people

369
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,480
they're often

370
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,560
read as lies which they may or may not

371
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,240
be but they do indicate that something

372
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,359
is abnormal that something is not not

373
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,279
the way it should be

374
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,680
uh and i tried to keep my voice flat in

375
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,160
that that that little example there too

376
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,160
because paraverbals is how we say our

377
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,719
words my favorite example from my cousin

378
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,079
finney

379
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,160
uh at arrest the protagonist says i shot

380
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,760
the clerk

381
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,920
i shot the clerk whoa but in court the

382
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,120
police chief says

383
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,319
and the defendant said i shot the clerk

384
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,279
i asked him again and he said i shot the

385
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,040
clerk

386
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,279
so consider carefully how our emotional

387
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,920
state especially in stress

388
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,279
our mood our exhaustion our excitement

389
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,959
our defensiveness

390
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,480
all can have an effect on how we say

391
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,959
things

392
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,720
uh there's also a media medium person so

393
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,518
person to person telephone spider phone

394
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,800
sms

395
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,160
chat radio teams meet zoom

396
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,800
unidirectional simplex on the

397
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,639
directional half duplex

398
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,479
your communication will be more abrupt

399
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,079
and at higher velocity in a burning

400
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,320
building than in the comfort of a beach

401
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,040
chair after beer number two

402
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,920
context is always important too right

403
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,319
she slapped

404
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,079
hard is a very different statement when

405
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,240
discussing a bass player

406
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:26,800
than a domestic disturbance

407
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,639
interference all the barriers

408
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,760
between a sender and a receiver with

409
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,760
their message their medium

410
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,600
things like fans and loudspeakers and

411
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,680
douchebags with open headers on mustangs

412
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,160
calgary southeast calgary seems to be

413
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,519
you know the uh i'm all one for for loud

414
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,920
exhaust

415
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,120
i'm a car guy i like cars but southeast

416
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,599
calgary where i live

417
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,399
is the uh the hotbed of douchebags with

418
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,360
open headers

419
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,480
who like to roll around at you know 9

420
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,680
p.m at night through

421
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,720
playground zones um

422
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,439
also the the building you're in right

423
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,399
you can have noise cancellers you can

424
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,440
have you know

425
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:09,600
happy uh echo canceling

426
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,240
tiles etc um from a ham radio days i

427
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,320
always

428
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,160
talked about trying to optimize in our

429
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,440
personal lives the signal-to-noise ratio

430
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,279
too we seem to have an awful lot of

431
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,440
noise all the time

432
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,480
and so little signal so little actual

433
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,560
important information

434
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,800
dang it's hard sometimes uh what we

435
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,479
also have you know technology we're all

436
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,680
talking over technology now if anybody

437
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,199
tries to call me on the phone i don't

438
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,479
answer it because chances are somebody

439
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,479
claiming to be from canada revenue

440
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,639
agency sending a share of tourists

441
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,600
but packet loss could also be

442
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,600
interference

443
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,959
and what have we all done recently more

444
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,199
so than anybody

445
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:47,439
else ever at any time

446
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,399
we're sticking masks on ourselves now

447
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,560
and then

448
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,480
having to yell at the poor lady from tim

449
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,279
hortons going i would like a double

450
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,600
double

451
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,600
double

452
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,959
so yeah okay it's hard we really hope

453
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,000
that at some point we have some feedback

454
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,800
in the loop too

455
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,720
that uh uh and and as a sender you can

456
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,479
ask for some of that feedback as a a

457
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,720
good active listener you can

458
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,600
uh deliver some of that feedback using

459
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,000
reflexive

460
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,800
listening tools paraphrasing summarizing

461
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,800
questioning

462
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,240
my favorite of covie's habits so seek

463
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,399
first to understand

464
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,600
then to be understood again no port does

465
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,360
this mean we have to agree

466
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,120
but as long as we understand each other

467
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,079
we have that mutual respect

468
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,519
so my point communication it's just as

469
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,519
complex as bgp

470
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,440
and just as prone to screwing off if you

471
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,079
found interpersonal communication hard

472
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,680
as a

473
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,359
computer technology professional as a

474
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,638
security professional well heck you're

475
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,440
not alone

476
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,800
especially like when the world is legit

477
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,600
on fire all around you

478
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,279
and i have no idea how my little

479
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,279
animated gif is coming through i stole

480
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,720
this idea from robert falzone of

481
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,680
checkpoint because he always has the

482
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,680
most brilliant slide decks

483
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,719
um i stole so i've the next three slides

484
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,160
are are my advice for

485
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,079
ways that you can form your

486
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,160
communications i stole this particular

487
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,399
one from the emergency response world

488
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,560
the situation report the sit rep etched

489
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,360
in stone as the can report

490
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,439
conditions actions need conditions

491
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,320
what's the current status of my piece of

492
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,320
the incident response

493
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,920
actions what are me and my team

494
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,480
currently doing what do we have in

495
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,319
motion

496
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,680
needs what do i need from you the

497
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,279
audience when you're good

498
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,359
and it takes some time we'll talk about

499
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,480
that too you should be able to relay

500
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,320
what you know

501
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,240
what you're doing and what you need from

502
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,040
any audience in a very short period

503
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,560
brief and organized uh the folks in the

504
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,680
last session talked about that

505
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,959
brief be good be brief be gone

506
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,638
uh but what you need is last working on

507
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,160
the theory of primacy serial position

508
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,040
effect from thorndike's laws google it

509
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,600
if you're looking for some really

510
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,680
interesting

511
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,720
ideas on you know occupational

512
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,479
psychology

513
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,720
uh great wikipedia article thorndike uh

514
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,079
t-h-o-r-n-d-i-k-e

515
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,720
especially in terms of high stress

516
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,800
everyone already is barely hanging on

517
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,319
and your audience is personal fifo

518
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,438
buffers the first and first note buffers

519
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,678
are already overloaded

520
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,360
people can't absorb a whole lot more so

521
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,319
just say what you're up to with the

522
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,639
intention of filling

523
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,480
other people's needs and get a

524
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,319
commitment for what you need

525
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,679
this can be part of a formal roundtable

526
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,000
or just making a request of another

527
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,000
person

528
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,679
or team and you need to listen to the

529
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,959
info you might need when you're asking

530
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,400
for need somebody else might already

531
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,919
have delivered that in their report so

532
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,400
get off your your phone

533
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,039
during the round table and and and pay

534
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,240
attention

535
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,760
um so okay heat is on here's some

536
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,280
examples i cooked up uh

537
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,919
from the firefighting world i'm actually

538
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,918
going to read this one

539
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,679
command there's a search team one inside

540
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,960
the structure light smoke is visible

541
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,320
with no heat we're completing the

542
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,679
primary search of the main floor and

543
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,639
requesting the results the exterior

544
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,120
suite before entering the basement

545
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,720
pretty simple hey what's up it's me i'm

546
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,320
search team one i'm inside the building

547
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,240
there's a little bit of smoke but

548
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,240
no you know real heat or anything um

549
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,360
we're just finishing up our primary

550
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,160
search for the main floor we want to go

551
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,678
in the the

552
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,440
the basement which is known as the

553
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,799
firefighter killer so maybe let me know

554
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,280
if you see any puffing smoke from the

555
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,918
outside

556
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,039
conditions actions needs all right from

557
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:13,039
physical security

558
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,679
uh control bravo zero an unexpected

559
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,440
person

560
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,440
has just been located in the data center

561
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,160
bravo two's taken up station at the exit

562
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,240
and

563
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,440
we'd really like a supervisor to come

564
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,200
down here and

565
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,360
review the individual's credentials and

566
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,480
maybe call the cops if necessary

567
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,199
conditions actions needs got a whole lot

568
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,400
through there

569
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,600
pretty quickly uh okay adam yadanki

570
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,240
let's apply this to information

571
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,840
technology then

572
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,799
ransomware was discovered on our data

573
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,720
share two it staff members are currently

574
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,000
focused on isolating any infected system

575
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,760
one staff member is attempting to

576
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,520
identify the point of entry so we can

577
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,440
limit the spread

578
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,720
we really need somebody with email

579
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,679
system expertise to assist with the

580
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,520
point of entry work

581
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,440
a team to prepare file restorations and

582
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,960
system imaging and

583
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,320
if you've got it somebody can translate

584
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,440
russian to see how truly screwed we are

585
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,439
if we can't get this under control

586
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,520
not bad i like that i don't know

587
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,199
i wrote it so i guess i'm biased

588
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,120
conditions we have ransomware

589
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,559
actions we have three people working on

590
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,719
it needs we

591
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,080
need a recovery team to say hi to cozy

592
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,120
bear

593
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,120
yeah good times

594
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,639
when you get good at it feels really

595
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,280
organized

596
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,960
crafting your message so conditions

597
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,678
actions needs i stole from the emergency

598
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,840
response

599
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,720
emergency services kind of community uh

600
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,879
this one care

601
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,520
uh where are we or precision clearance

602
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,039
objectivity i heard this on a podcast

603
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,000
once and i pulled over

604
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,200
my car on the side of the anthony henday

605
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,760
um

606
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,120
i i can't remember who i stole this from

607
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,480
and i feel really bad i've googled it

608
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,840
and i've never been able to come up with

609
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,280
it again so if anybody knows where i

610
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,360
stole this from i'd

611
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,280
love to give them credit um but thinking

612
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,719
back to our time versus bad stuff graph

613
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,120
once you kind of get out of the need for

614
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,360
those those really quick sit reps right

615
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,959
and you can start you know actually

616
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,559
crafting your messages a little better

617
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,840
the can report still works

618
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,600
but you can focus on crafting your

619
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,959
message a little more carefully uh

620
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,799
another triumph

621
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,400
of cleverness that i like precision

622
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,080
clarity and objectivity

623
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,679
and this goes back on you the sender

624
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,439
encoding your message precision

625
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,159
i don't care about your filler words use

626
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,720
um ah like all you want

627
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,080
what no one wants when more storage is

628
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,760
undergoing ransomware attack every

629
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,918
second is a 20-minute diatribe and crap

630
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,200
that it's going to make a difference

631
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,320
we don't need a dump of everything

632
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,600
you've been working on we're assuming

633
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,639
you got it handled

634
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,918
unless you need something to help me

635
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,280
along this path i've also been playing

636
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,520
with adapting the

637
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,399
i love emergency services stuff the five

638
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,120
rights of of

639
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,840
of of administering medication in first

640
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,600
aid

641
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,320
if you've ever taken a first aid course

642
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,000
uh through st john ambulance or canadian

643
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,639
red cross highly recommend that stuff by

644
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,400
the way

645
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,320
the right drug the right dose the right

646
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,760
route the right patient at the right

647
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,520
time

648
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,280
yeah i got that right um so i've been

649
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,799
trying to re-adapt that into solving

650
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,000
some of my precision communication needs

651
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,760
get the right information

652
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,159
the right volume of it through the right

653
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,480
medium with the right context

654
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,000
at the right time it's a little big i

655
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,200
know it's a work in progress

656
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,440
just no matter what you're delivering

657
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,159
just do your best to make it precise

658
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,200
clarity is about your audience um the

659
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,640
reality is

660
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,640
uh tanya said it this morning too you're

661
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,400
b-sides i expect that you know about

662
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,960
security and you know about technology

663
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,280
that

664
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,480
you're on top of this that you're good

665
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,559
um

666
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,559
so just be super careful not to fall

667
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,440
into the trap of jargon acronyms insider

668
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,879
knowledge that

669
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,559
your audience might not actually know

670
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,240
about one of my pet peeves is the word

671
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,158
obviously and sometimes i use the word

672
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,000
obviously myself and i chastise myself

673
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,360
for it maybe it's obvious to you

674
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,880
but maybe it's not obvious to everyone

675
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,399
in the conversation and even if it's

676
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,080
kind of an attempt to self-depreciate

677
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,960
it comes across as arrogance of

678
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,080
belittling and the last thing that you

679
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,760
want is

680
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,199
is resistance in the listener um

681
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,320
so besides i'm making this assumption

682
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,080
that you're technical you know how to

683
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,840
use google and jargon assumptions that

684
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,960
i'm tossing out here are things that

685
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,520
either you can google

686
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,039
or you already know um but that's the

687
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,799
danger for us as technology

688
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,039
professionals is that somebody might not

689
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,120
know what ospf is or

690
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,559
code injection or root hints or any of

691
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,039
those other lovely things we talk about

692
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,720
maybe 99 of our audience does in a

693
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,520
crisis situation though with that one

694
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,919
percent

695
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,760
that doesn't understand us has the

696
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,400
potential to be our one roadblock or

697
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,919
maybe it proves our spending request

698
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,440
then it's time to move on to no name

699
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,400
brands

700
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,200
uh an old adage and i talk about it with

701
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,640
jason maynard did such a great job of it

702
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,159
if you can't if you call yourself an

703
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,200
expert and you can't explain the concept

704
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,159
in terms that

705
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,360
that the sender can or sorry that the

706
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,520
receiver can understand

707
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,039
then i as a sender probably don't know

708
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,400
my message well enough to be trying to

709
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,120
explain it as an expert

710
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,240
uh objectivity out-of-body experience uh

711
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,120
i love my homer

712
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,480
there um try to understand your

713
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,080
listeners motivations

714
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,520
to drill down to what's really important

715
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,559
for everyone in a crisis

716
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,600
folks don't want to hear you flexing

717
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:05,678
they want to hear how you've made an

718
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,840
impact on their priorities or lessened

719
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,720
their noise and given them more signal

720
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,320
uh

721
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,760
if you need some leverage try thinking

722
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,960
of this is empathy for your listeners

723
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,960
bernay brown

724
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,640
has lots of great talks on empathy i

725
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,200
found them really helpful in describing

726
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,640
how no matter what the situation you may

727
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,400
agree with me or not but in this

728
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,960
pandemic in particular we're all in this

729
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,120
together

730
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,799
across the planet uh if we're going to

731
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,320
get through it together we have to let

732
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,679
go of some of our own views and try to

733
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,879
understand the bigger pictures even if

734
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,080
it's a crappy picture like how we're all

735
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,440
supposed to achieve new normal on the

736
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,678
time of plague is a business

737
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,039
or you know a five-year-old's finger

738
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,919
painting of a fire truck with

739
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,919
dinosaur arms

740
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,799
oh water is great um and as crises

741
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,640
stabilize and we're really starting to

742
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,960
focus on things like business continuity

743
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,880
can

744
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,320
you remember we went up and then we kind

745
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,520
of did it down then we did another up

746
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,039
and we're kind of going down again

747
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,879
we could start focusing on business

748
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,600
continuity communications continue to

749
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,360
have less

750
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,959
urgency and more formality we can

751
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,120
aid people in understanding our message

752
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,799
by focusing on storytelling

753
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,320
instead of fact rattling grinding our

754
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,720
way through white papers reports

755
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,439
policies corporate public document

756
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,400
broadcasts

757
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,400
it usually sucks

758
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,080
storytelling and again brevity is is

759
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,840
nice for sure but sometimes you need to

760
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:28,559
hit people the the simon cynic stuff the

761
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,480
start with why why how what really comes

762
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,480
into play here too

763
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,600
and you can do it i stole this one this

764
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,840
one is is

765
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,360
stolen with license from michael

766
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,279
santarcangelo um

767
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,639
if you google security catalyst he runs

768
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,799
leadership and uh

769
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,679
and vendor education and consulting uh

770
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,639
his straight talk

771
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,760
program has been incredibly influential

772
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,039
to me

773
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,240
i encourage everyone to seek out as

774
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,520
training if you want to be a real leader

775
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,200
or if you want to have a really healthy

776
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,799
sales pipeline in security

777
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,000
great stuff um so yeah storytelling

778
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,200
makes for communications that people

779
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,320
actually want to read and that they'll

780
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,320
take with them and

781
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,279
for sean you were asking about some of

782
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,080
this too how about security awareness

783
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,840
and cyber security education for our

784
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,799
users

785
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,120
characters conflict resolution the three

786
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,960
parts to every good story

787
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,719
um the characters are the people

788
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,360
responsible for and affected by this

789
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,279
incident

790
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,399
hey besides calgary thanks for coming

791
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,200
along for the ride

792
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,000
with me characters pretty simple it

793
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,799
doesn't have to be

794
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,440
easy or in case of my funny pictures

795
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,039
there

796
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,559
ten thousand we could almost buy our own

797
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,000
ship for that but who's gonna fly it

798
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,840
could you

799
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
yeah conflict the common goal or

800
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,678
objective that we're addressing

801
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,279
right doesn't actually have to be a

802
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,400
fight i was kind of hoping for a city of

803
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,840
edmonton versus

804
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,240
city of calgary ciso grudge match um

805
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,199
i'm pretty sure hannie can hit harder

806
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,039
but tim

807
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,919
is a good runner so i'm not really sure

808
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,400
how that would have worked out that

809
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,159
would have

810
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,679
been a hoot um with martin in the middle

811
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,760
or or maybe rachel

812
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,880
no rachel would be the judge martin

813
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,960
would be the referee

814
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,320
i think that would have been awesome

815
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,559
sorry

816
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,559
squirrel uh conflict the common goal or

817
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,559
objective that we're trying to address

818
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,799
with in this particular story darth

819
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,120
vader i've been waiting for you obi-wan

820
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,279
we meet again at last i made you some

821
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,199
toast it's a little on the dark side

822
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,200
don't you think

823
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,799
um and resolution here's how we're

824
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,679
working together to achieve

825
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,520
our common goals can not just your goals

826
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,120
not just my goals our common goals

827
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,879
or how we're measuring success and how

828
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,479
we can all achieve it it might feel

829
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,600
silly but it works and if we look at all

830
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,400
media it's kind of

831
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,480
the standard formula everything follows

832
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,760
hobbits like many meals we have to

833
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,799
destroy the one ring

834
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,879
mount doom i'm the doom guy oh

835
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,559
those imps or and floating eyeball

836
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,919
things need to get splattered with the

837
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,840
bfg9000

838
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,279
i reached the end roll credits uh real

839

because that's his name um he told me

842
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,320
that his dropbox app disappeared from

843
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,919
his work computer one day

844
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,200
and so he went to the help desk and said

845
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,919
hey why'd my dropbox disappear

846
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,440
all he ended up was getting the cyber

847
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,080
security group said it's been removed

848
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,520
because of policy

849
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,720
do you think that satisfied them no it

850
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,639
just made them think of cyber security

851
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,240
teams a bunch of aminos

852
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,520
could have been much different um so if

853
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,399
we try it with the storytelling

854
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,799
mentality

855
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:24,959
again it's not i am a rambler but

856
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,799
characters conflict resolution so i'm

857
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,720
going to read this one off here

858
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,720
well here's the thing our security team

859
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,480
flag dropbox is a risk and our company

860
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,000
is cash strapped and our help desk is

861
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,279
already overwhelmed but we recognize

862
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,679
you have a business need for a cloud

863
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,720
storage tool we can't use dropbox in the

864
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,760
manner you've been doing it

865
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,200
the potential for you to put

866
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,080
intellectual property in a personally

867
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,000
managed tool

868
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,279
and lose access to it could be super

869
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,200
impactful to us

870
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,399
but we have onedrive for business

871
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,320
activated with our office 365 accounts

872
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,840
please grind through that with the

873
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,799
online learning portal and see if it'll

874
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,879
do the same stuff

875
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,000
because uh then the files stay under the

876
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,039
company's protections

877
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,880
and and and our custody and we all come

878
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,120
out looking pretty suave

879
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,559
okay sure it's simplified but i believe

880
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,080
it works so much better than because

881
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,360
policy

882
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:15,120
um if you want in the words of

883
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,719
tim mcright get people to do what you

884
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,158
what you want to do get people to do

885
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,120
what you want to do because they want to

886
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,240
do it too

887
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,239
and that's what this is about

888
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,840
so we've done the conditions actions

889
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,279
needs precision clarity and objectivity

890
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,799
characters conflict resolution that's

891
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,440
how you can actually start building your

892
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,000
messages

893
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,440
and and and find ways to actually bring

894
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,440
people along for the ride

895
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,960
how do you actually get that work and

896
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,320
and and

897
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,480
you know the reality is this is real

898
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,918
leadership stuff um you might

899
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,600
just think you're not a leader you're

900
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,120
not a boss you know you know i'm just a

901
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,120
pen tester but the reality is

902
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,000
you are leading people along a path to

903
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:57,120
you know sean's earlier question

904
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,960
the the the reality is we're asking

905
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,479
people to get better at cyber security

906
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,720
sure cyber security can be all about

907
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,559
technology if we want but the humans the

908
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,320
people who use the computers

909
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,840
are the piece of the puzzle that we

910
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,399
still are really really struggling with

911
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,158
isn't it

912
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,760
so you have the opportunity in every

913
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,559
interaction with humans to to help be a

914
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,320
leader

915
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,960
uh introspect like spider-man check

916
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,720
yourself before you wreck yourself

917
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,720
lots of us have talked about uh

918
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,520
dunning-kruger effect or illusory

919
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,600
superior

920
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,360
or superiority over the years the idea

921
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,799
that you know people get a little bit of

922
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,600
info and they think they're experts on a

923
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,080
subject

924
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,360
um and then we point at them and laugh

925
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,639
at them and say ah you're not actually

926
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,840
an expert in anything

927
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,440
uh the reality is is that we are all

928
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,240
kind of subject to it all of us

929
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,240
so recognizing our own weaknesses take a

930
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,760
peek inside recognize our own weaknesses

931
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,919
and use those as motivation to keep

932
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:50,080
educating and improving ourselves

933
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:52,080
if you can and do this carefully

934
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,199
so as you don't break any wiretapping

935
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,120
laws i think it's

936
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,039
like part six of the criminal code i

937
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,039
can't remember um

938
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,960
but consider recording yourself during

939
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,000
your own sit reps or participating in a

940
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,000
meeting or

941
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,600
record your side of a phone call be

942
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,320
careful not to break any wiretapping

943
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,799
laws please

944
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,760
uh it's it's amazing what we can learn

945
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,600
about ourselves

946
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,120
with that little bit of separation too

947
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,799
is that if i've recorded myself and then

948
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
i go back and and listen to it later i

949
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,039
can

950
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,719
see where i communicated best when i was

951
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:21,200
when i was doing the firefighting thing

952
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,080
um and anytime that i was in a command

953
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,000
situation

954
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,199
all of our radio communications were

955
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,440
actually recorded

956
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,880
uh after all the adrenaline was gone and

957
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,159
all the stuff was cleaned up i would go

958
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,279
back and i would listen to my recordings

959
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,559
and i would actually say well how did i

960
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,919
sound on the radio and

961
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,039
sometimes i sounded good sometimes i

962
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,360
didn't but i take the times that i

963
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,240
didn't to learn from that

964
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,479
um prioritizing really uncover with

965
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,320
objectivity what's a priority again a

966
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,520
really important leadership thing here

967
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,320
um everybody cringes at the sound of the

968
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,440
person for whom

969
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,200
everything is an emergency um if

970
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,720
if the blood isn't going round and round

971
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,000
and the air isn't going out you know

972
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,640
life safety stuff

973
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,240
that's a real problem your seat got

974
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,559
moved

975
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,720
take a chill pill avoid being that

976
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:06,320
catastrophizer

977
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,840
put things in a real bucket of what's

978
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,519
really a priority and in the incident

979
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,959
command system we prioritize through the

980
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,480
big three life safety instant

981
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,880
stabilization protection of assets

982
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,200
property environment star dot star

983
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,240
so one two three life safety take care

984
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,480
of the incident and

985
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,279
uh protection of all the things

986
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,480
afterwards

987
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,640
something that's super helpful are

988
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,159
predefined incident severity levels with

989
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,399
built-in accountabilities

990
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,320
um i don't know maybe we could talk

991
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,439
about that besides 2021 or something and

992
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,000
own things care

993
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,720
make a conscious choice to be that

994
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,320
leader

995
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,080
um so i've learned an incredible amount

996
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,678
i learned so much from my own kids my

997
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,039
middle kid 13 years old she's been the

998
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,840
captain of a couple of sports teams

999
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,679
already

1000
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,879
um and not because she's always been the

1001
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,679
fastest skater

1002
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,640
or the takes the hardest shot or scores

1003
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,080
the most gold

1004
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,880
she's always chosen by her peers and her

1005
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,199
coaches

1006
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,399
because she wants to help she in her own

1007
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,039
words she wants to help bring out the

1008
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,959
best in

1009
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,080
in everybody else she wants to bring

1010
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,360
bring out the best

1011
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,918
get people to bring out the best in

1012
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,199
themselves those kind of attributes no

1013
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,240
matter where you are

1014
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,760
if you have them and if you espouse them

1015
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,919
if you hold them dear to your heart you

1016
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,120
become known as the people to be relied

1017
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,320
upon when stuff

1018
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,279
goes south um the people who get talked

1019
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,200

1020
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,200
that colton dude he's always so good in

1021
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,640
the crisis um

1022
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,919
actively choose to improve yourself and

1023
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,880
actively choose to bring out the best in

1024
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,960
everyone around you

1025
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,320
again besides this is a fantastic

1026
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,360
opportunity for anybody

1027
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,600
that if you're looking for a place

1028

to help this is it this is a great

1029
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,039
opportunity

1030
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,959
uh and then the last question that i

1031
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,879
have this is my last slide before my

1032
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,399
my kind of exit which i think i'm trying

1033
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,279
to get us back on track which would be

1034
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,279
lovely

1035
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,559
and i'm gonna go back to the chat and

1036
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,240
see if there's any uh

1037

1041
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,439
back to them afterwards

1042
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,120
how do we get there how do we become

1043
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,720
great security communicators when plague

1044

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,440
one of the ones that's always a

1082
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,399
challenge and we do this all the time

1083
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,440
because we're lazy and we're really

1084
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,000
hoping the answer is no

1085
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,480
that question of is there anything i can

1086
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,879
do no of course not

1087
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,719
find something you can do and engage get

1088
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,279
in there find a way to get in there

1089
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,959
um practice bust out the 20-sided die

1090
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,599
and take on the demigorgon

1091
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,440
um on my website at missioncritical.ca

1092
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,800
and this isn't a plug for my consulting

1093
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,520
business because it doesn't exist

1094
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,359
uh i've got a but i'm just using that's

1095
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,280
my email addresses and where all my

1096
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,239
family hangs out oh god please don't box

1097
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,200
me it's also

1098
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,078
wordpress please don't hack me um head

1099
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,319
over to

1100
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,599
if you go to mr critical.ca and you pop

1101
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,280
into the cyber security tabletop

1102
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,200
scenarios it's just some really simple

1103
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,880
like a few dozen like really simple

1104
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,078
really basic scenarios that you can have

1105
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,040
some fun with take it to your

1106
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:07,359
team my biggest takeaway from running

1107
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,000
many many tabletops for a very very long

1108
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,400
time

1109
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,599
make the scenario simple and play along

1110
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,400
with your environments

1111
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,119
variables don't try to control the

1112
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,119
outcomes

1113
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,640
let them evolve naturally but just pull

1114
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,160
out some floaters chuck them on the

1115
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,440
table and say okay uh

1116
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,879
jeff you're up here's your situation

1117
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,240
you're kind of farting around with

1118
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,520
something you're following something

1119
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,200
funny and you found out that

1120
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,800
the lady who everybody loves has been

1121
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,799
with the company for 25 years

1122
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,240
uh in accounting you know sings the

1123
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,480
loudest on cake day also

1124
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,919
happens to you know be doing books on

1125
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,160
the corporate computers for the hell's

1126
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,000
angels

1127
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,480
how are we going to deal with that jeff

1128
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,240
go ah right

1129
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,920
and plan planning uh me and my seven ps

1130
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,160
that i stole graciously from

1131
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,480
i think the us army uh proper prior

1132
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,399
planning prevents poor performance

1133
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,560
using scenarios uh and tabletops

1134
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,839
uh anything that you've currently are

1135
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,960
previously engaged in

1136
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,279
connect with your marketing

1137
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,119
communications teams find somebody in

1138
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,280
your organization who likes to write

1139
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,720
build your own high probability and high

1140
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,040
impact risk scenarios

1141
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,799
and just build yourself some templates

1142
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,920
because oh boy if you've got pci

1143
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,240
compliance you want to start dealing

1144
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,480
with that animal on the fly a

1145
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,000
um essential stuff that i believe is

1146
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,720
important to have in your back pocket

1147
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,440
ready to go

1148
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,879
in 2020 privacy or health information

1149
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,640
breach notifications

1150
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,000
um which comes in a couple of different

1151
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,440
ways one

1152
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,880
you might have to talk to rachel uh

1153
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,040
at the oipc and your

1154
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,079
everybody's got pii don't kid yourself

1155
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,640
you've got pii

1156
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,520
in your environment um even if it's just

1157
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,240
your own hr

1158
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,960
information you got pii maybe p personal

1159
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,479
health information too

1160
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,359
so you may have to do a notification to

1161
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,599
them or your customers or your vendors

1162
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,560
right so so have some of that kind of

1163
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,119
pre-built

1164
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,799
and and don't build it under stress

1165
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,640
because that sucks well i guess

1166
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,640
if you have to you don't have a choice

1167
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,640
um

1168
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,160
media holding or formal statements if

1169
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,520
you can get somebody maybe on

1170
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,598
even on a contract to help you with some

1171
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,839
media holding informal statements

1172
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,920
because honestly maybe your ransomware

1173
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,359
attack will get you in the news

1174
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,040
if you've got customers and your

1175
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,000
customers complain enough you could end

1176
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,720
up on global

1177
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,839
i don't know but the idea of having that

1178
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,439
in your back pocket also

1179
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,960
something to revisit on a regular basis

1180
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,320
helps you understand where your

1181
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,320
customers are and what their

1182
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,160
is important to them um insurance and

1183
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,839
lawyer activation messages you

1184
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,200
don't necessarily want to be walking

1185
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:38,560
down the hallway going

1186
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,439
to the ceo saying um do we have a lawyer

1187
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,680
on retainer

1188
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,800
uh while things are going ugly and same

1189
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,480
with your insurance maybe find out what

1190
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,680
your insurance is and figure out what

1191
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,440
their expectations are

1192
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,118
um financial partner compromise

1193
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,680
notifications because business email

1194
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,520
compromise is still a thing because

1195
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,118
people still click things and read

1196
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,599
things so

1197
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,160
just some ideas of things that you could

1198
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,800
use

1199
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,359
in your own world ahead of time so

1200
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,680
engage

1201
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,880
you know say yes get involved in things

1202
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,399
it doesn't even necessarily have to be

1203
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,640
security but just things that

1204
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,640
that are ugly and messy get involved dig

1205
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,480
in um and maybe that's just my personal

1206
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:16,319
bias because i like the dirty stuff

1207
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,240
uh practice like actually practice but

1208
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,520
don't get overwhelmed with huge tabletop

1209
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,839
scenarios just

1210
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,880
easy quick floaters have some fun and

1211
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,359
plan the more

1212
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,160
proper prior planning the less poor your

1213
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,240
performance will be

1214
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,000
so that's what we talked about in my my

1215
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,479
five of threes

1216
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,240
uh precision clarity objectivity

1217
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,320
conditions actions needs

1218
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,759
characters conflict resolution

1219
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,800
introspect prioritize

1220
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,880
own engage practice and plan all in

1221
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,000
in hacker friendly green text on black

1222
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,920

enough to support a breach coach

1251
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,800
get that that's one of those proper

1252
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,359
prior planning things get involved in

1253
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,839
that

1254
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,119
uh and dedicated cost centers to track

1255
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,920
expenses related to instant

1256
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,000
investigation

1257
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:59,520
depending on your uh your organization

1258
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,240
you may or may not get some some

1259
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,359
uh some traction with that i've found

1260
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,560
that a number of

1261
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:08,799
of of accountants especially now

1262
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,240
and in depressed economic conditions are

1263
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,640
feeling really pinched by saying oh yeah

1264
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,319
here's

1265
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,160
here's a here's a variable bucket that

1266
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:16,079
you can use for not sucking what i have

1267
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,680
done in the past and has given me some

1268
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,560
really really good advantages

1269
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,359
is having an instant response retainer

1270
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,319
with uh

1271
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,520
um any number of vendors and i'm not

1272
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,599
going to name any because

1273
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,319
i've already done my my product

1274
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,920
placements but there's any number of

1275
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,920
vendors out there who can give you ir

1276
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,640
retainers so and and they can include

1277
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,200
things as well

1278
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,720
like breach costs and if you don't

1279
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,598
actually use their services for incident

1280
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,279
response

1281
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,720
you can use them for the tabletops so

1282
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,319
you can help outsource some of your

1283
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:52,399
design of your your exercises as well

1284
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:56,240
what else do we have in here

1285
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,240
oh tj you're so sweet

1286
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,599
uh tony tony yeah

1287
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,400
the the why how what if anybody's not

1288
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,800
familiar with

1289
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,560
the simon i guess it was it was the tedx

1290
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,880
talk that launched simon's career

1291
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:15,040
it's on youtube it's it's lovely it's uh

1292
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,400
it's it's a fantastic thing that talks

1293
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,960
about how to

1294
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,000
start hitting people at their heart and

1295
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,680
i would i would offer

1296
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,960
that that's something that we tend to do

1297
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,000
when we're when we talk about decision

1298
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,520
making and

1299
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,240
back to another one of adam's three

1300
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:31,920
things we tend to make decisions

1301
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,640
emotionally logically or financially

1302
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,359
well there's a three uh you know

1303
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,799
emotionally

1304
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,119
we tend to make a lot of our decisions

1305
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,040
emotionally financially you

1306
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,880
what when's when's the best time to go

1307
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,720
to the restaurant when we're hungry

1308
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,640
uh what do we do when we're broke we

1309
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,319
look in the fridge um

1310
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,279
or or the logically thing we always

1311
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,279
think that we're making

1312
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,400
logical decisions about security and

1313
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,839
things like that but the reality is

1314
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,480
chances are we're pissed off at someone

1315
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,720
and we're

1316
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,680
we're more interested in having a fight

1317
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,118
um

1318
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,440
again talking about education and

1319
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,280
awareness is that we want to get people

1320
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,040
thinking critically

1321
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,160
pause think verify anybody who worked

1322
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,440
with me while i was at the city of

1323
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,279
calgary would have heard that over and

1324
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,160
over again is probably sick of it by now

1325
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,079
but asking people to pause when they're

1326
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:20,319
they receive a call to action over

1327
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:21,839
email or over uh over a web page or over

1328
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,720
a text message or a phone call or

1329
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,520
anything

1330
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,118
slow down think think critically use

1331
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,680
your critical thinking skills in your

1332
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,560
brain

1333
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,759
to do the work and verify if it doesn't

1334
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,520
pass the initial sniff

1335
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,960
test just go ask somebody feel free to

1336
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,480
use that i didn't copyright it and i

1337
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,160
hope nobody ever does copyright it

1338
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,920
because it makes really good sense

1339
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,920
to be able to you know get people

1340
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,480
people who are using computers to really

1341
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,880
understand kind of our priorities too

1342
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,359
slow down think about it but the reality

1343
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,560
is is to get to the frontal cortex where

1344
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,078
we do all of our thinking at the front

1345
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,960
of our brain again i'm not a doctor or a

1346
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,240
psychologist

1347
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,839
but everything comes up the nervous

1348
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,759
system through the back of our head at

1349
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,560
the hippocampus where all of our

1350
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,560
emotions

1351
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:05,520
are generated ah so we have to consider

1352
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,520
the emotional

1353
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,599
aspect of asking people to make

1354
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,640
decisions

1355
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,400
uh what else do we have in the personas

1356
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,200
masks to reduce human talk of nature and

1357
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,280
made us

1358
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,399
more listening i would one of the more

1359
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,040
interesting things for me

1360
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,440
is that um because i have resting

1361
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,800
resting jerk face

1362
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,880
uh when walking through a uh

1363
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,160
when walking down a hallway or something

1364
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,839
i usually like

1365
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,359
i make eye contact with somebody and i

1366
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,200
love the idea of

1367
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,960
you know giving somebody a silly grin or

1368
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,640
something and that's what

1369
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,400
and it's amazing people smile back and

1370
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,920
they get goofy and that's what the mask

1371
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,319
has eliminated for me so i have to be

1372
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,960
very mindful now of of where my eyes are

1373
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,319
in my head

1374
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:52,240
anyways um there's somebody back now and

1375
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:53,040
some say that he invented the magnetic

1376
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,479
resonant

1377
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,839
immature and he once lost a kayak on

1378
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,800
bomaris lake

1379
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:01,920
all we know is he's called harvinder my

1380
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,200
