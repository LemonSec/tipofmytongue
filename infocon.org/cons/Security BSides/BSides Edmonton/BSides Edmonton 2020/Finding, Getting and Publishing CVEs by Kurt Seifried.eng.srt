1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,200
so I'm just gonna start a timer so I

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,470
don't run out of time

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,960
so finding getting and publishing CV

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,489
ease

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,410
bluntly what is the CV and why do people

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,610
keep bugging me about them so this is

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,789
the one slide I have to read from I

8
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,680
apologize so do you remember those flaws

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,500
and Intel CPUs who here's had to deal

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,109
flaws in Intel CPUs recently okay so

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,300
we've got Spectre meltdown foreshadow

12
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:31,830
how many am I forgetting about yes

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:36,180
correct and so who remembers the one

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,710
that broke a SLR via MMU right exactly

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,620
that's the most recent one for shadow so

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:45,570
that is actually no sorry that's last

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:47,730
year's one CB 2017 five nine to five and

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,260
hands up if anybody knows whether or not

19
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:56,370
it got fixed no it did not get fixed not

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:59,160
by the CPU vendors so basically there's

21
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,169
CV 2017 five nine two six five nine two

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,839
seven five ninety-two eight for them

23
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,460
Owen 5/9 wait for the browsers so the

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,110
browser's fixed it by remember they took

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:12,419
away our high accuracy timing

26
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:15,450
functionality so yeah so basically who

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,180
fix that well for example if you look at

28
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,310
Souza's page on their CV they marked it

29
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,430
won't fix as did many vendors because

30
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,860
quite frankly the SLR is broken so we've

31
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,810
given up on it but the point of this is

32
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,150
is without CVS looking up this

33
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,390
information becomes nyam possible

34
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,060
whereas with the CV you have a lovely

35
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,009
screen like this saying the description

36
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,220
you know page table locks blah blah blah

37
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,470
boring but more importantly those links

38
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,470
at the bottom so if you click on them

39
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,000
you end up but this is the ANC so this

40
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,289
is the original project page and a

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,509
little snippet from it where they talk

42
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,670
about you know some process or vendors

43
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,619
agreed with our findings that a SLR is

44
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,079
no longer available security defence at

45
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,090
least for the browsers others did not

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,589
dispute our findings I love that it's

47
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,990
like they didn't argue too much so it

48
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,570
must be real from the browser vendors

49
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,910
most found our paper relevant and you

50
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,700
know did something with it and then sort

51
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,620
of track this we have those those four

52
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,649
CVE numbers right one for Intel

53
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,159
one for AMD one for arm and one for like

54
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,959
all the browsers and this is not an

55
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:26,120
uncommon case right if you've dealt with

56
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:28,769
Specter or meltdown or foreshadow or

57
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,060
whatever you know this is becoming more

58
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:31,079
and more of the clownin case right

59
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,640
everything's interlinked and

60
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:37,500
interrelated in just a giant mess so

61
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,869
what's the source of truth for CB right

62
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:44,879
a lot of people you see B's who has the

63
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,670
truth well the answer is simple it's the

64
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,929
mitre corporation and technically

65
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:53,040
speaking mitre is a nonprofit entity but

66
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,329
isn't the US government it's just they

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,679
get all their funding from the US

68
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:57,030
government it's about four billion a

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,500
year and they run a bunch of projects

70
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,349
for the US government including a bunch

71
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,560
of cybersecurity projects like the C V

72
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:06,209
program so they ultimately hold the true

73
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,299
source of truth for C V and that would

74
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,500
be at CVE mite org and then there's a

75
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:12,359
bunch of people who republish it

76
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,430
probably the one most of you use and

77
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:16,680
that I use is the national vulnerability

78
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,660
database right hands up who who knows

79
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,180
the nvd from nist intimately right

80
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,918
everybody the reason for that is simple

81
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,840
because nist adds a whole bunch of

82
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,630
useful information to make cv more

83
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,639
palatable they add the CBS f scoring

84
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:32,609
right so on a scale of zero to ten how

85
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:35,340
badly you know does this hurt they add

86
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:36,510
the CPE data which is the product

87
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,519
information you know is it the Linux

88
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,959
kernel is it G Lib C is it you know

89
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,400
which version of Windows is affected and

90
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,040
then there's a whole pile of people who

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,079
republish stuff like CV details or and

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,168
all these other sites which to put it

93
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:54,720
bluntly are not a source of truth in the

94
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:56,639
sense of they're probably correct they

95
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,709
may not be I don't know you know we

96
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,139
don't track them we don't make sure that

97
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,810
they're correct so I would say if you're

98
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:06,389
dealing with CV please go to either the

99
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:09,359
mitre CV database which is the the true

100
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:12,690
truth the nvd is very good they pull

101
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:15,629
from it but one little dirty secret is

102
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,130
you know the nvd really only cares about

103
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:18,478
the stuff that US government cares about

104
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,250
that's literally what they're paid to

105
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,430
care about so when they do an analysis

106
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:26,070
of a vulnerability like to have the CBS

107
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,510
s scoring they will do that for Windows

108
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,760
and Linux and you know

109
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,980
large enterprise projects that the

110
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,060
government uses but you know for a PHP

111
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,220
script thing

112
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:39,030
yeah the US government doesn't care most

113
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:41,160
cases so that data that you're kind of

114
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:44,520
relying on the NBD to add may not be

115
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:47,220
added soon if ever right because there's

116
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,990
tens of thousands of CVS a year now well

117
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,930
just over ten thousand about eighteen

118
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:54,960
thousand last year and so yeah please go

119
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,130
to the original source of truth start

120
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,710
your investigation there to make sure

121
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,450
that you're not you know chase I've seen

122
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,880
some sights that republish cv data and

123
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:05,340
they they drop stuff or they add stuff

124
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,050
that isn't correct and that's even worse

125
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,489
because then you chase down a Ravel only

126
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,230
to find out that it has nothing to do

127
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,950
with what you thought you were trying to

128
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:18,960
deal with so let's get to the meat of

129
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:20,580
the talk finding a CVE so how do we find

130
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,810
a cv is actually quick question has

131
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,010
anybody here ever found a vulnerability

132
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:28,980
or an exposure and gotten it a cv

133
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:30,870
awesome so that's the first thing

134
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,340
vulnerabilities and exposures so

135
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,480
vulnerabilities we're all pretty

136
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,429
familiar with vulnerabilities right

137
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,070
we're talking remote code execution or

138
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,860
you know the the attacker can escalate

139
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,690
privilege or the attacker can you know

140
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,760
send a wonky ping packet to your server

141
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,440
and your server tips over and dies right

142
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,320
vulnerabilities tend to be pretty

143
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,060
clearly cut simply put you know does the

144
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,950
attacker do something bad yes or no

145
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,320
right do they do something they really

146
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,820
shouldn't be allowed to do I'm not gonna

147
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,890
bore you with actually how you find

148
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,320
vulnerabilities because I'm sure most of

149
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:03,240
you know how as an aside if you want to

150
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,740
rack up a quick CV account just go

151
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,770
through github and search for terms like

152
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,360
XSS or buffer overflow people fix these

153
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,039
things and label them as such but they

154
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,480
don't bother to get CVS for them so if

155
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,240
you want to like get a whole pile of

156
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,050
Seavey's to your name literally uh that

157
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,520
that's the quickest way to do it

158
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:24,960
now exposures what's wrong with this

159
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,650
picture are those key secret anymore no

160
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,590
exactly

161
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,840
so exposures don't typically allow an

162
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:34,049
attacker to get directly into a system

163
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,700
or to directly escalate privileges but

164
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,760
like going back to my first example you

165
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,680
know a SLR address stack layout

166
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,560
randomization we used to think was

167
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,139
amazing because it you know it made the

168
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,229
exploit codes fail right because you'd

169
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:51,780
exploit a problem overwrite a buffer you

170
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:54,210
had pushing your shellcode and you'd

171
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,309
call it and it wasn't there and you

172
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,750
couldn't find out where it went right

173
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,090
like it was just literally in some

174
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,919
random place and you could theoretically

175
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,500
try and brute force it maybe but that's

176
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,229
not gonna work well yeah as it turns out

177
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,780
a SLR you can determine the layout of

178
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:12,719
memory through a whole pile of tacks

179
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:16,049
just search the CV database for the term

180
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,630
aslr bypass and so you know we've

181
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,919
learned for example a SLR no longer

182
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,570
works as well as we thought it did

183
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,698
because there's all these exposure bugs

184
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:26,960
where you can determine how is memory

185
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:30,080
laid out I've seen things where you know

186
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,638
database exposure of hashed passwords

187
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,430
yeah not always terrible except when

188
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,949
they're like just md5 you know hashing

189
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,289
them and you can you know everybody in

190
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:45,479
here with a laptop can now enforce those

191
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:46,949
you know because you have a laptop CV

192
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,520
counting inclusion rules this is

193
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:53,280
intentional there's a lot of text it's

194
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,500
very detailed but honestly what it

195
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,049
really boils down to is sort of a couple

196
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:02,760
of main things number one for inclusion

197
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:04,710
is currently we cover traditional

198
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:08,099
software and hardware so on premises

199
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:12,659
right we don't yet officially cover CVS

200
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:14,699
for like services that's coming we're

201
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,960
working on it but basically the first

202
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,620
thing is is you know is this something

203
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,630
that a customer actually runs that they

204
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:25,229
you know acquire and run and can do

205
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:27,930
something about right the second thing

206
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:29,520
is is this something we cover right

207
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,050
traditionally it meant enterprise

208
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,439
software stuff the US government cares

209
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,880
about you know Microsoft Linux blah blah

210
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,260
blah

211
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,820
obviously that scope is expanding you

212
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,289
know there's a ton of IOT stuff coming

213
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,630
out of China some of its in my house

214
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:45,319
there's no CV coverage for that and I'm

215
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:47,459
a little I try not to think about it

216
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,339
because honestly I can't do anything

217
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:53,010
about it so that's basically you know do

218
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,329
we cover this with CV or not then the

219
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,160
second aspect of that is

220
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:58,410
what's called a CV numbering authority

221
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,600
so Microsoft is a CNA right they cover

222
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:04,290
Microsoft products Red Hat covers Red

223
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,350
Hat Oracle covers Oracle and then as far

224
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:10,579
as counting goes splitting and merging

225
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:13,739
so there's never just one vulnerability

226
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:15,238
right like anybody who's looked or dealt

227
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:18,059
with computer bugs there's never just

228
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:19,709
one buck right like if there's one bug

229
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:21,449
there's more bugs you know it's like

230
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:23,160
cockroaches or ants in your house right

231
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:25,139
it's not like one little guy just

232
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,029
happened to wander in from South America

233
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:28,470
and took up no it's like you've got to

234
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:31,709
like tear down your walls and like get

235
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,480
all the bugs out so this is a very

236
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:35,609
common case where literally you know

237
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,259
like the Intel stuff is a great example

238
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,879
because now that people know to look for

239
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:40,769
these types of side-channel attacks and

240
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,299
all this monkey stuff you know we're up

241
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:44,639
to about what is it 15 or 20 of them

242
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:45,839
right like and and they're just gonna be

243
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,209
like another dozen every year that's

244
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,029
just it's a fact of life now so how do

245
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:52,829
we split and merge these the answer is

246
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:55,619
really simple is it basically does it

247
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:57,479
add value right so if you audit a PHP

248
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:59,399
application you're gonna find a file

249
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,379
across sifting cross-site scripting

250
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,199
vulnerabilities because that's how PHP

251
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:06,269
works right and so is there really any

252
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:07,618
value in like oh you found 10 cross-site

253
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:10,110
scripting vulnerabilities and this

254
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:12,299
different parts of the PHP script we're

255
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,860
gonna assign 10 CDs well no because

256
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:15,509
ideally what'll happen is you find 10

257
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,329
vulnerabilities and then the next

258
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:19,499
release fixes 10 vulnerabilities

259
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:21,269
hopefully doesn't always happen so

260
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:23,160
ideally we merge all those

261
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:25,790
vulnerabilities into one CV you know we

262
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,860
treat it as a package deal and move on

263
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:31,529
if you've ever looked at CDs you'll see

264
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:34,619
the phrase CDE so and so blah blah blah

265
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:37,009
is assigned as an incomplete fix for

266
00:10:34,619 --> 00:10:40,110
this other CD right so what'll happen is

267
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:41,939
somebody'll find myself speaking I found

268
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,579
13 flaws temporary file creation flaws

269
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:45,899
in a piece of software pulled them they

270
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:49,859
had to fix them they said yes we'll fix

271
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:51,269
them they fixed six so good start they

272
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,529
released an update saying we fixed all

273
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:53,910
the tenth laws and like really did you

274
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:55,980
and I checked and of course they fixed

275
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,899
six so I assigned a second CD saying you

276
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,189
know there's still seven remaining can

277
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,839
you guys please fix them for real this

278
00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:03,029
time they're like oh we promise yes we

279
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,949
will they released an update saying yes

280
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,419
we fixed them all of them we promise and

281
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:07,209
I'm like hi check the code there's still

282
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:09,100
three I'm like okay

283
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:12,309
we're almost there like this is progress

284
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,990
right third time's a charm and they got

285
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:16,410
all the remaining three right but as a

286
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:18,759
customer using that software you know

287
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:21,579
well which version actually has all of

288
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:23,649
these things faked so it simply boils

289
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:26,979
down to we bucket up the CVEs

290
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:28,209
so that each class of vulnerability so

291
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,170
if you have like cross-site scripting

292
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:31,209
and a buffer overflow

293
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,069
yeah those those are very different very

294
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:35,378
different impacts very different exploit

295
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:37,329
models so it makes sense to split them

296
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:38,980
right because there's a company chances

297
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,540
are you'd be like exercise whatever the

298
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,920
web thing deals with that it you know we

299
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,779
got some magic Cisco appliance that

300
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,309
claims to magically deal with this and

301
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:47,379
it probably does but the buffer overflow

302
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:49,629
oh that's that's bad that's you know

303
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:52,059
that's a bad guy getting in and taking

304
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:54,129
over our server and the second main

305
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:57,670
bucket we do which version is affected

306
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:59,470
right if you have my favorite is the

307
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:01,149
Linux kernel you know oh we found a flaw

308
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,769
in it well what versions does it affect

309
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:03,819
oh it affects these versions oh and

310
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:05,709
while we were looking we found this

311
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:07,179
other related flaw but it affects a

312
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:08,410
different set of versions because you

313
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:10,889
know that code was added six months

314
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,579
later lever right so it becomes very

315
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:13,839
important when you're tracking this

316
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:16,748
stuff especially you know in the

317
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,759
enterprise world to know like you know

318
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:20,860
which versions actually fix this stuff

319
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:27,459
so that's splitting and merging it in a

320
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:30,160
nutshell so let's make a CV first

321
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:33,910
question when should you ask for a CV

322
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,449
for your vulnerability and the simple

323
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:39,790
answer is as soon as possible please

324
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:45,160
because it makes talking about it and

325
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:47,829
tracking it so much easier my yeah this

326
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,350
is public now so I don't know if anybody

327
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:52,089
remembers the GFC stat guard stuff from

328
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,259
what was it two years ago I want to say

329
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:55,329
or a year ago

330
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:58,360
anyways Qualis did some really good

331
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:59,888
research found a flaw in G ellipses

332
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,269
stack our page right so the idea is you

333
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:03,519
have this one megabyte stack our page

334
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:04,600
which if the attacker touches we know

335
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,970
something bad happened and we stopped

336
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,670
them awesome they found you could

337
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,829
literally jump over it okay cool and

338
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,790
they came with a proposed solution and

339
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:14,559
everything was awesome

340
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,689
until one of our really smart guys

341
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:19,120
Florian VMR looked at it and went no

342
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:19,529
there their problem is wrong because

343
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,660
there's a

344
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:22,740
three problems and their solution is

345
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,209
wrong because we'll have to make the

346
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,290
stack guard page three and a half

347
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:29,579
gigabytes per process for it to work and

348
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,800
oh yeah did I mention we now have

349
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:34,979
actually I found two more problems right

350
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,599
so now we have three problems so talking

351
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,430
about these problems you know when I say

352
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,290
like oh the koalas stack card thing the

353
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,670
one that they found originally no maybe

354
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:44,189
or was it no it's the second one that

355
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,990
Florian found in mention you know it it

356
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:46,740
becomes impossible to have a meaningful

357
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:51,540
conversation

358
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:54,269
whereas CVE 2016 1 2 3 4 & 1 2 3 5 & 1 2

359
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,939
3 6 right they're scoped they're defined

360
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:59,459
you know we we can talk about what we're

361
00:13:56,939 --> 00:14:01,889
talking about so basically like babies

362
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:05,248
please put a CV number on it as soon as

363
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:07,529
possible especially if the vulnerability

364
00:14:05,249 --> 00:14:09,540
is not yet public right if it's it's an

365
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:11,180
embargoed or private vulnerability still

366
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,709
and you have to talk to other people

367
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:16,349
it's so much easier when you have a CV

368
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:18,329
because literally we all know what we're

369
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,529
talking about and most people have to

370
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:22,079
handle more than one security flaw at a

371
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:24,720
time right like a vendor like Red Hat I

372
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,670
left in June but essentially the the

373
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,589
trend was red hat product security was

374
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:32,610
handling roughly 3,000 vulnerabilities a

375
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:34,410
year yeah so we're handling a lot of

376
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:38,459
vulnerabilities you know a company like

377
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:39,870
Microsoft is around a thousand you know

378
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:42,300
if you look at even some of these open

379
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,709
source projects they have hundreds of

380
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,750
vulnerabilities per year because just

381
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:48,989
the size and scope of what they build

382
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,509
it's complicated and there's flaws so

383
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:53,509
please I can't stress enough asked

384
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:56,399
sooner rather than later

385
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:57,809
the second step is just the CV already

386
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,100
exists right I've had a lot of people

387
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:02,490
ask to receive you for something where

388
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,839
we already have a CV for that the

389
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,470
challenge there obviously is if we have

390
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,480
duplicate CV entries it makes a mess the

391
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:12,300
good news is I convinced mitre to move

392
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,179
all of the data into github now it's in

393
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:17,339
git and we can update it so that's the

394
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:19,709
one dirty little secret the old mitre CV

395
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:23,249
database had no update mechanism right

396
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:25,979
every entry had some data but there was

397
00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:28,829
like no field to specify that like this

398
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,569
has been updated on this date right so I

399
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:31,769
actually at one point had like manual

400
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:33,209
tools that would download the database

401
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:35,249
every hour compare

402
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:36,809
to the previous version and show me the

403
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:38,999
differences like what was added what was

404
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:41,429
deleted what what is new whatever right

405
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:43,559
so now that we're in github obviously if

406
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:46,199
you're familiar with git it's really

407
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:48,029
really easy to look at a file or a set

408
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:49,949
of data and get and be like what has

409
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:57,720
changed since Thursday or has it changed

410
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:59,790
at all if you're getting a CVE who is in

411
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,720
charge of that software so as I was

412
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:05,219
saying scope so the idea of scope is a

413
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,339
company like Microsoft in theory knows

414
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,019
their software the best and can best

415
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:12,389
handle and assign the CV for that

416
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:14,100
security issue right same thing ideally

417
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:17,279
with Red Hat or with Oracle or with

418
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,240
whomever so the basic premise of when

419
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,730
you find a CVE

420
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,009
in a piece of software that has a CV

421
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,220
numbering authority in charge of it you

422
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:28,379
have to go to them first and also

423
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:30,899
obviously we want people to report put

424
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:33,089
vulnerabilities to the vendors to the

425
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:35,730
projects right to the upstream so that

426
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:37,769
they can get fixed right who here has

427
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:41,970
seen a security flaw talked about online

428
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:44,730
and nobody told the project right that

429
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:46,649
that's sadly quite common with some

430
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,029
things right so I mean it's I love

431
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:50,480
people to find vulnerabilities that is

432
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:53,329
something that we need more people to do

433
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,920
but we also sort of need them to tell

434
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:57,420
the people in charge of that software

435
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,199
about it so that maybe they have a

436
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:03,529
chance to fix it right because yeah

437
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:09,599
otherwise we're just kind of being jerks

438
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:12,869
so right now there's a CNA scope

439
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,969
document that's terrible because it says

440
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:16,918
things like like for example Airbus is a

441
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,230
CV numbering authority and Airbus covers

442
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,600
all of their own products and all of

443
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:24,299
their suppliers now who here knows who

444
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,619
Airbus as suppliers are nobody like of

445
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:27,359
course nobody knows who their suppliers

446
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:30,928
are probably Airbus doesn't even know

447
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,490
fully so again this is a project we have

448
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:34,980
a specific project called the CV user

449
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:37,049
registry where the premise is everybody

450
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,570
involved in the CV project will have to

451
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:42,929
declare like who they are and what they

452
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:46,649
cover so like Red Hat for example when I

453
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:50,910
left there was a 110 or 120 commercial

454
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:53,400
and 126 github organizations that I

455
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:56,790
managed to track down right so Red Hat

456
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,620
has this huge footprint of stuff

457
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,120
same thing with Microsoft right who

458
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,199
hears heard of great playing software

459
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,600
well Microsoft bought them like

460
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,090
apparently 10 or 20 years ago I really

461
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,709
had no idea or I remember once I was

462
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,629
looking at snoring I'm like why why does

463
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:12,120
the snort page say Cisco now like what

464
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,190
oh wait what happened

465
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,129
so ideally we're gonna have a registry

466
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:19,620
with URLs of the products with the names

467
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,150
of products so that you can easily take

468
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,399
a piece of software and go like who's in

469
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,570
charge of this and if there is somebody

470
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,210
in charge of it you'll be able to figure

471
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,980
it out in a few seconds and if not we

472
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,890
have what are called the CNAs of last

473
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:35,340
resort so it's it's a scoping thing that

474
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:37,050
I'll get into in a sec but simply what

475
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,110
is the minimum CV entry does anybody

476
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,190
offhand know well it's it's what you

477
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,919
literally saw in that previous screen

478
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,850
it's literally you have to have a CV ID

479
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,100
you have to have a product name in

480
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,350
version obviously right we've got to

481
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,379
know what we're talking about you have

482
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:54,300
to specify a problem type which is not

483
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,710
entirely true there's a lot of CVS in

484
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,930
the CV database I don't know if you've

485
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:00,630
looked at Oracle stuff for example where

486
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:03,000
you know an unknown flaw unknown impact

487
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:05,550
you know exploitable through unknown

488
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,770
means has this terrible effect like

489
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,850
thank you Oracle and I mean in fairness

490
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,980
where you gonna do either you apply the

491
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,120
patch or you don't right like there's

492
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,070
really not a lot you can do with some

493
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,850
vendors so ideally there's a problem

494
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,570
type you know

495
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:20,669
buffer overflow cross-site scripting

496
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:24,120
temporary file whatever there's that

497
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:26,340
text-based description which doesn't

498
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,939
have to but also again ideally also

499
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,770
includes like an impact you know does

500
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,510
this result in code execution does it

501
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,690
result in the server catching fire does

502
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:39,510
it result in you know whatever and then

503
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,950
the references which is the URLs which

504
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,260
you know if you've ever had to

505
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,930
investigate a CVE those those are the

506
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,700
goals right those are that's what you

507
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,290
want right is those references so you

508
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,450
can go spider out and start looking at

509
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,950
stuff and then finally of course needs

510
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,870
an assigning cname like who actually

511
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,920
assigned the CV right like they just

512
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,919
can't appear out of nowhere

513
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:04,540
so currently we're working on federating

514
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,060
the CV hierarchy if you look at it

515
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,350
currently it looks like this it's mitre

516
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,899
everybody like it's a flat structure

517
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:13,030
completely right what we want to move to

518
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,250
is where we have the primary CNA which

519
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:18,340
would be mitre probably and then for

520
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,750
example we're hoping that JP cert you

521
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,129
know Japan sort will take over the

522
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,870
Japanese market because they speak

523
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:25,780
Japanese and they live in the same time

524
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:27,429
zone right for anybody who has had to

525
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,350
deal with people and like asia-pac you

526
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:32,140
know that the time zone thing is a huge

527
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,669
problem and the language and culture

528
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,770
thing is very different right like I

529
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,210
come from the open source world and the

530
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:39,400
way open source handles security

531
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,620
I can guarantee you would not fly it all

532
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,780
in Japan right like they just could not

533
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:46,090
culturally that would be a no-go

534
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,230
same thing for aerospace right aerospace

535
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,580
isn't gonna be like oh sure yeah yeah

536
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,500
whatever publishes details it's fine

537
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,760
yeah we'll fix it later right they're

538
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,550
gonna get sued same thing with

539
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,900
pharmaceuticals and medical you know who

540
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:59,440
here remembers the whole st. Jude's

541
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,400
pacemaker debacle right somebody claims

542
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,050
they found a flaw

543
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,060
the pacemaker company came out really

544
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:05,889
hard saying no you didn't well it turns

545
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:09,610
out they did find flaws that were really

546
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:11,590
really bad so the idea is we'll have

547
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:15,850
these hierarchies we have one for open

548
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:17,709
source right now and longer-term we're

549
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:21,459
hoping that like IOT medical devices

550
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:23,380
aerospace you know also Geographic ones

551
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,840
because like I said you know sometimes I

552
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,370
don't speak Mandarin or Cantonese like

553
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,250
and and we've dealt with people there

554
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,840
where they don't speak English right I

555
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,390
mean and so like Google Translate is

556
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,629
great and all but not that great so this

557
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:40,960
is something we're working on sadly this

558
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,820
guy has more automation than we do the

559
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,200
currency you're gonna see I'm gonna live

560
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,470
a sign of CV and you're gonna see the

561
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,690
horrifyingly manual process that we have

562
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:52,540
or that I have and most companies don't

563
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:55,080
have anything that much better but yeah

564
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:57,879
right now publishing to the CV database

565
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,560
looks basically like you hand it off to

566
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,300
a CV numbering authority hope they do

567
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:05,530
the right thing and in some cases that's

568
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:07,389
me and I apologize I'm terrible again

569
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,399
we're working on automation I got them

570
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:10,650
to put this thing in github so at least

571
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,270
now the data

572
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:16,080
can get a read copy of it very easily

573
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:18,450
and longer-term we will be you know

574
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,760
granting more people access to write to

575
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:23,160
the data which is something we just

576
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,480
didn't have in past and if anybody here

577
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,340
has been doing CVS for more than 10

578
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,240
years you'll remember there was a really

579
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:33,000
bad period about between about 10 and 6

580
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,220
years ago we're you know getting CVS and

581
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,830
getting them published took forever and

582
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,990
the reason was simple like mitre lost a

583
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:43,199
bunch of their funding they had like one

584
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:44,220
or two guys working on it so yeah that's

585
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,020
what happens when you have one or two

586
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,810
guys working on a project it gets slow

587
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,220
and stuff would just disappear into the

588
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:53,010
mitre hole right you send them a CV

589
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:56,370
request and it's gone for like three

590
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:57,900
months or a year whatever who knows at

591
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,310
least now that it's in github you can

592
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:03,300
sort of see what's going on to a degree

593
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:06,360
so finally publishing your CV to the

594
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,110
world so number one get your CV as early

595
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,280
as possible

596
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:13,169
number two use it ideally in a perfect

597
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,450
world put it in the git command now

598
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:17,070
realistically a lot of people find and

599
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,960
fix security flaws very quickly or

600
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,639
sometimes they fix a flaw don't realize

601
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,870
it's a flaw and then somebody else comes

602
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,670
along and goes hey that that code

603
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,870
commits you committed is really awesome

604
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:27,870
because it fixes a security flaw and

605
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:30,899
you're like what oh yeah I think I'm not

606
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:33,090
sure is that good but publishing it as

607
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,040
soon as possible and using it widely

608
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:37,169
makes life so much simpler right if you

609
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,430
have the CV and the changelog the

610
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:42,570
release notes in the you know

611
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:44,090
documentation in your database whatever

612
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:47,280
it just makes it so much easier

613
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:50,340
especially now that with open source you

614
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,590
know it's not like it affects one person

615
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:55,949
right something like the Linux kernel

616
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:58,379
GFC open SSL right everybody ships that

617
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:01,710
right open SSL is a great example how

618
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:04,290
many of us own a TV okay you all have

619
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:06,180
open SSL on your TV right because all

620
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:08,700
the other SSL implementations cost money

621
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:11,250
so when you build a TV and you need to

622
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,560
put SSL and TLS into it which you have

623
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,000
to do now because it what has two needs

624
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,520
to be able to do Skype and or aku and

625
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,460
Netflix and all that other stuff

626
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,379
it has to have an SSL TLS client well

627
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,870
are you going to pay money for it or use

628
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:29,370
open SSL well everybody uses openness

629
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:33,629
same thing with cars so demo of a CV

630
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:35,189
assignment so basically I run the

631
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:37,289
distributed weakness filing project

632
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:40,289
which is a fancy way of saying open

633
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:42,929
source CV ease it's a holdover from my

634
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:45,929
work at Red Hat so I actually have to

635
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:48,600
pull up that page image so literally if

636
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:50,309
you want to get a CV for open source and

637
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,709
it's not covered by a cine so for

638
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:54,260
example there is you know red hats a CNA

639
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:56,520
that cover there open source stuff

640
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:59,760
kubernetes is a CNA they cover

641
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,620
kubernetes but if there's not a specific

642
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,110
CV numbering authority for that's

643
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,149
offered go to I want to see the e org

644
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,740
and you'll see this form and I ask

645
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:12,840
things like oh that's terribly small

646
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:17,190
sorry but you'll basically see I ask for

647
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,899
things like you know is this open source

648
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:21,330
I've actually had people request off for

649
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:24,658
not open source and I'm like I can't

650
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:25,590
help you sorry and then I'll ask you for

651
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,010
things like what's the name of the

652
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,870
product

653
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:30,360
who's the vendor what version is

654
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,350
effective like do you know please tell

655
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,350
me you know because if you don't know

656
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:37,668
then we have a problem you know what is

657
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,668
the vulnerability a lot of people

658
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:43,350
they'll find a problem like oh I made

659
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:46,049
the program crash cool good for you is

660
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:49,260
it reproducible is it something actually

661
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:50,908
bad you know if you can make I remember

662
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,730
it was it was a piece of software that

663
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:56,730
turned a specific file format for sheet

664
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:59,820
music into PDF files right so you could

665
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:02,220
like write up a score and then turn it

666
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,990
into a PDF and print it nice and you can

667
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:07,649
make a crash with like a wonky file

668
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:08,820
cool the response from the CV community

669
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,918
is like don't don't do that

670
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,240
like don't open that file again if you

671
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:13,980
open a file in that program and it

672
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,990
crashes well just stop doing that

673
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,080
versus let's say a web browser now

674
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:21,000
should a web browser be able to open

675
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,908
literally any web page full of god knows

676
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,190
what and not crash the answer is yes

677
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:27,630
right that is an expected behavior you

678
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:30,570
know should you be able to open an email

679
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:32,880
no matter how badly formatted and your

680
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:35,039
email client doesn't like go nuts

681
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,870
well yeah right that's that's expected

682
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,740
behavior

683
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:41,559
so I basically asked for a bunch of

684
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:46,420
information and it gets trucked into a

685
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:48,190
spreadsheet that literally looks like

686
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:49,540
this like that it's a bit out of order

687
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,950
but basically there's the timestamp

688
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:54,250
there's who requested it right there's

689
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:55,570
the vendor of the project the URL of the

690
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,679
product is I want to you know sometimes

691
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,740
I have to go check and make sure it's

692
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:01,120
actually open-source and I'm flexible

693
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,490
that way like if it's always hi licensed

694
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,350
for sure cool in other cases you know

695
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,809
all whatever close enough is close

696
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,949
enough right

697
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:10,360
what's the vulnerability type right as

698
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,170
you can see there's a nice selection of

699
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:15,280
different vulnerabilities

700
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:16,870
you know what's the affected component

701
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,399
right like have you actually narrowed it

702
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:19,989
down a bit and in some cases you can see

703
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,510
they haven't they're just like whatever

704
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:25,720
the whole thing it's affected what's the

705
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:29,410
impact of exploitation right again if

706
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:32,740
you can't clearly articulate and say I

707
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:35,380
did X which caused Y and Y is bad

708
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:37,390
because then you know maybe it's not

709
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,250
really a security flaw right but most

710
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:41,050
security flaws like ninety-nine point

711
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:43,150
eight percent of them are really simple

712
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:44,770
like I made it crash I made it do what I

713
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:48,580
wanted to do with code execution

714
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:49,950
I read your passwords like you know it's

715
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,178
not rocket science

716
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:55,750
ideally an attack vector because again

717
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:57,850
you know if I remember are some PHP apps

718
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,840
whether like oh if you're the admin you

719
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,428
can do a cross-site scripting

720
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,678
vulnerability by putting up these custom

721
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:04,330
web pages and I'm like yeah that's about

722
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:06,970
right you know like that seems

723
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:09,820
reasonable and in other cases they

724
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:12,250
explicitly say no if the administer

725
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:14,470
users not do this that the other thing

726
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:16,770
oh okay that's a flaw you know as

727
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:19,480
defined by your sort of security profile

728
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:22,540
then I asked for references and this is

729
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,220
always lovely because people some people

730
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,889
have a habit of putting stuff into

731
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:28,990
YouTube videos and sending that which

732
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:31,000
sucks because like I have to watch a

733
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,980
YouTube video let's really badly made

734
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,120
and you can barely read the text but I

735
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,740
can't cut and paste and it's not

736
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,610
accessible and that's something as I get

737
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,700
older I'm beginning to realize

738
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:41,199
accessibility matters right like we

739
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,910
don't want a lock of blind people out of

740
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,580
the security community that I feel would

741
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:48,610
be kind of a jerk move so one thing I'm

742
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:50,620
pushing for is some form of a rule that

743
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,750
will say like when you submit data for

744
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,419
CVS like

745
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:55,290
reference URLs I don't know exactly what

746
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,790
the rules say but something like you

747
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,960
have to be able to like cut and paste or

748
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:00,420
you have to be you know I mean it can't

749
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:04,460
just be like a screenshot of a PDF of

750
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:07,620
text again I've had people send that

751
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:09,390
ideally more than one reference URL and

752
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,979
then there's my stuff my notes and like

753
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:13,140
how terrible this is and as you can see

754
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:17,160
I've there's a bunch of stuff I've

755
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:19,620
rejected like one request there at the

756
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:23,580
top it lacks a request URL and Jeremy

757
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:25,379
sent me a new one but here's my this

758
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,360
week's my favorite request so this guy

759
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,790
sent me a request for a Python software

760
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,379
and one thing I've noticed is when it

761
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:33,060
comes to people claiming flaws in like

762
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,210
big projects like Python they're either

763
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:37,770
totally correct or like totally nuts

764
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:39,270
this guy turns out totally correct

765
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,040
so he's like hey there's a flaw and

766
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:44,510
Python in C Python you know which we all

767
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:47,280
use in love right python is awesome and

768
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:48,000
fixed version after commit so and so oh

769
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,030
my goodness

770
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,530
that's lovely vulnerability type good

771
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,960
lord he's actually got it there nicely

772
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:56,970
cwe 77 improper neutralization of

773
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,070
special elements used in a command also

774
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:02,820
known as command injection like we're on

775
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:05,370
fire affected component good like

776
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:07,439
seriously the SH util module make

777
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:09,840
archive function like he's narrowed it

778
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,360
down it's a denial of service and

779
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,889
information go blah blah

780
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,320
you basically have to open up on

781
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,490
malicious zip file which yeah that's a

782
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,200
pretty reasonable thing to do right a

783
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:22,230
lot of data gets passed around a zip

784
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,930
files and gets unpacked somewhere and

785
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:26,400
turned into lord knows what and then he

786
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:28,830
has these URLs and he actually for

787
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,660
example this is a good sign I'll link to

788
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,040
the official bug tracker that's like

789
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:35,040
this is kind of the gold standard

790
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:36,720
Stinney this is kind of the gold

791
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,300
standard right because the beauty is not

792
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,270
only is it in the bug in the bug tracker

793
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:44,399
for the project but then chances are oh

794
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:47,280
look at that they actually acknowledged

795
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,960
it and fixed it so at this point I'm

796
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,030
feeling comfortable that you know this

797
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,630
guy is legit and if you read it you know

798
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:55,139
bla bla bla

799
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:57,060
it's not I love this this utils spawn

800
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,740
isn't very good at quoting command lines

801
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,450
and then he links to an older bug where

802
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,900
they talk about this back in 2015 and

803
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:05,040
never really fixed it awesome so new

804
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,620
change set some

805
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,629
long number by Benjamin Peterson in

806
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:13,590
branch 2.7 blah blah blah fixes this

807
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:14,010
awesome he also links us to the older

808
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,439
bug

809
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:18,390
as you can see 2015 and it's kind of

810
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,750
like yeah whatever it's hard to quote

811
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:26,100
characters they talked about it a bit

812
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:28,350
and then nothing really happens that's

813
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,120
quite common for sort of quasi related

814
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:32,189
security bugs that aren't clearly bad oh

815
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,139
my goodness

816
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:37,800
here's the Asheville commit which as you

817
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:41,520
can see is pretty pretty simple right

818
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:43,649
it's yeah they replaced the spawn with

819
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,030
sub-process check and I don't know if

820
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,830
you're familiar with Python but python

821
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:48,300
kind of goes in that we wrote something

822
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,970
that did something we figured out it was

823
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,139
terrible so we wrote like a newer thing

824
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,580
that we called something different and

825
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,530
it doesn't much better and then we found

826
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,210
out that was terrible and so like in

827
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:59,250
Python to open up a command line you've

828
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:02,690
got like I want to say like six or seven

829
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:04,890
options like different ways to do it and

830
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:07,470
as my current understanding is sub

831
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:11,220
process is probably your best bet to do

832
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:17,340
this securely and safely then we've got

833
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:18,840
the link to the the actual like issue in

834
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,889
github which again this is a good sign

835
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,990
right this is all sort of these are

836
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:24,060
legitimate sources of information it's

837
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:27,240
not some random guys web page with like

838
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:28,200
a PDF on it saying I claim x y&z and

839
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,650
more to the point you know it's being

840
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:34,200
acknowledged by the developers right

841
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:35,610
I've literally had flaws where literally

842
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,840
the flaws like I found a cross-site

843
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,550
scripting moment program and the

844
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,110
response from the developers yes you did

845
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:41,520
thank you we fixed it awesome and I'm

846
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:44,189
like oh so easy to make that request

847
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,260
I've had other ones where they make some

848
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:48,210
crazy claim and it's ignored or the

849
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:51,120
admin goes I don't think someone closes

850
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:57,510
it and I'm like you know can you give us

851
00:32:51,120 --> 00:33:00,330
a hint maybe again or github stuff and I

852
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:02,280
even linked to a reproducer like how

853
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:04,080
nice is this person right they gave us a

854
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,510
clear bug report they link to the

855
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,980
official sources they link to the code

856
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:10,050
commit to fixed in it they gave us the

857
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:12,900
right versions the names and like here's

858
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:18,658
a reproducer I'm like I love this person

859
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:21,210
right so what do I do with that well

860
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:25,379
basically I go to my little spreadsheet

861
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:27,239
and that entry is like now happy so I

862
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:30,029
move it into the assigned request tab

863
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:33,389
and then I give it a CV number literally

864
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:38,729
that's it so there we go I gave it CV

865
00:33:33,389 --> 00:33:40,199
2018 1 million 802 so I've given it a CV

866
00:33:38,729 --> 00:33:41,639
number but I haven't yet published it

867
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,200
right we probably should do that so

868
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:45,209
let's do that now what I basically do is

869
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,489
and and I don't usually do this one at a

870
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,479
time I do them like Friday afternoon at

871
00:33:47,489 --> 00:33:52,249
the end of the week usually in batch

872
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:52,249
them operating do it all in one big go

873
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:01,639
tell me when you can

874
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:09,569
is that readable or bigger ok well I'm

875
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:14,129
getting old too and I abhor TenPoint

876
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:16,529
fonts when I'm watching stuff so first

877
00:34:14,129 --> 00:34:21,719
thing I'm gonna do is update my local

878
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:24,200
copy of the CV list repo how to explain

879
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:27,239
this same way the mitre corporation

880
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:28,888
moved the data into get but git is not

881
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:32,038
the true source of truth the way they

882
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:36,210
work is you submit your data to a branch

883
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:38,399
of their git repo they then pull that

884
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:41,190
data into their back-end which lives

885
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,469
somewhere in like North Virginia mangle

886
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:45,480
it manipulate it put it into their

887
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:47,730
database and then they export their

888
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,869
entire database back into the get thing

889
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:53,760
I think it's once an hour so the git

890
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:55,950
repo is not the true source of truth

891
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,049
it's like people and stuff the git repo

892
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:59,609
the actual he didn't backend and that's

893
00:34:58,049 --> 00:35:01,740
just historical process right they've

894
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:05,160
got this back in that they wrote in like

895
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,390
95 and that's that so it's it's a bit of

896
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,279
a cumbersome process because what it

897
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,990
means is you can not touch master if you

898
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:11,130
touch master everything breaks so we're

899
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:14,578
not allowed to touch master

900
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,690
so I update all that stuff and then I'm

901
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,119
gonna check my notes to make sure I'm

902
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:21,750
not forgetting anything yeah

903
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:24,839
so first thing I'm gonna do is what I

904
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:28,319
would normally do is I essentially

905
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:30,990
reserve a CBE right so there's a bunch

906
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:34,050
of CBE's well now number 802 is 802

907
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:35,600
three probably maybe I used it for an

908
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:39,869
embargoed issue that isn't yet published

909
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:42,060
so what I do is I mark a CV as reserved

910
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:45,140
and actually the easiest way to do that

911
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:47,490
we'll be taking existing reserved one

912
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:50,460
and make a new reserved one

913
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:52,740
so basically CV 1 million six hundred

914
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:55,710
thirty is reserved and I just made a

915
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:58,520
coffee up basically so here we go as you

916
00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:02,190
can see a reserved seat is very simple

917
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:04,950
it's basically marked as taken and like

918
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:06,510
is reserved and the value reserved this

919
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,859
Canada has been reserved blah blah blah

920
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:10,500
basically it's going to be used at some

921
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:12,150
point so now you know I'm hopefully not

922
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:17,160
going to double assigned 802 because I

923
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:22,670
almost never do that then I'm going to

924
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:22,670
make a CV so that makes a big good

925
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,470
and I'm just gonna skip the whole where

926
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:45,150
I would normally commit that reserved CV

927
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,740
put it into the databases reserved and

928
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:50,099
then you know later actually publish it

929
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:54,899
we'll just do it live those live demos

930
00:36:50,099 --> 00:37:02,250
are the best demos so whoops nope that's

931
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:02,910
the wrong directory here we go okay

932
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:08,670
there we go

933
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:11,339
so what I do what I discovered most

934
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:12,930
people aren't great at writing English

935
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:14,670
especially if it's like their second

936
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:16,560
third or in some cases fourth language

937
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:18,060
so I used to ask people to write their

938
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,790
own CV descriptions and I discovered

939
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:22,020
that that was not the way to go so now I

940
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:24,810
just asked for the data and then I

941
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:27,150
generate it let's open that in something

942
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:29,940
more readable like atom so I basically

943
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:32,790
machine generate it literally using

944
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:36,530
sentences with like variable replacement

945
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:39,819
like it's it really is that simple

946
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,819
[Music]

947
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:54,290
let me there's a really sadly easy way

948
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:56,609
to make this a bit more readable for you

949
00:37:54,290 --> 00:38:00,529
this is my go-to when I need to like

950
00:37:56,609 --> 00:38:00,529
super quickly format a chunk of JSON

951
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:12,989
okay so as you can see the format is

952
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:13,319
reasonably simple and of course it's out

953
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:14,969
of order

954
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:17,609
so basically at the top we would have

955
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:21,839
the metadata right this was assigned on

956
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:26,098
today's date it was requested oh geez a

957
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:29,400
while ago the ID the assignor me the

958
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:32,630
requester this guy I assume data format

959
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:35,249
mightor problem type da blah blah

960
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:38,359
description English so we now support

961
00:38:35,249 --> 00:38:42,200
multiple languages huzzah

962
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:44,880
improper neutralization bla bla bla so

963
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,558
we scroll up of course you'll see things

964
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,049
like so we've got machine readable data

965
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,519
now now the dirty secret things like

966
00:38:49,049 --> 00:38:52,950
that product name and that vendor name

967
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:54,899
are not standardized I apologize

968
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:56,848
something we're working on so for

969
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,249
example when we have the Linux kernel

970
00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:02,309
you know is it Linux kernel the Linux

971
00:38:59,249 --> 00:39:04,049
kernel Linux kernel project I don't know

972
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:05,460
but we basically we need to pick one and

973
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:09,779
stick to it right I think you would all

974
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:11,640
agree with that scrolling up there's the

975
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:13,979
description written by a computer script

976
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,288
so Python Software Foundation Python C

977
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:20,519
Python version 2 1 7 contains a blah

978
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:22,229
blah blah you know it's not the

979
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:24,149
prettiest English but it's readable and

980
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:26,189
then we've got our references which

981
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:27,890
again that's kind of often the more

982
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:32,099
important stuff because that lets you

983
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:35,788
research it and track it down so yeah

984
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:38,180
good enough so we got a file and I will

985
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:38,180
just

986
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:58,750
okay so I need to make a branch and uh

987
00:39:49,720 --> 00:40:00,129
whoops so this will make the branch and

988
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:05,340
then check it out so I'm now working on

989
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:11,110
a branch called DWF - today's date - l1

990
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:13,380
I'm gonna copy the JSON file here get at

991
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,380
it

992
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:27,390
[Music]

993
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:55,309
stinking and then I will commit it to

994
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:57,740
that branch and that exists now in my so

995
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:59,300
I have a copy of the CV list repo so I

996
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:02,000
have my own repo that I work on and then

997
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:06,410
I push my changes and github makes that

998
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:15,650
quite wonderfully simple let's make this

999
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:23,629
bigger oh there we go

1000
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:28,760
so compare and pull request and I click

1001
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:31,400
Creole request and that's it now what

1002
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,230
will happen is my tur on their end will

1003
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,670
look at the pull request they have a

1004
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,809
little bit of CI to make sure that the

1005
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:39,250
request is well form you know that I

1006
00:41:35,809 --> 00:41:41,569
haven't sent them some mangled JSON or

1007
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:44,839
whatever right there's there's all sorts

1008
00:41:41,569 --> 00:41:47,480
of things that go wrong yeah it's

1009
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:48,680
ridiculous sometimes but anyways they'll

1010
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,000
basically run through their CI test

1011
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,609
they'll make sure it's like a sign to

1012
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,200
get commit right we require signed

1013
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:56,180
commits so that we don't have random

1014
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,549
people dumping stuff in there you know

1015
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:01,368
we have a very strong factual evidence

1016
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:04,460
trail now of like who did what - which

1017
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:08,180
CVE win which we didn't have before so

1018
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:11,359
this is a bit of an improvement but

1019
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:13,460
essentially at some point probably what

1020
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,390
time is it on the East Coast they've all

1021
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,010
gone home so it'll probably happen

1022
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:18,430
tomorrow morning they'll look at this

1023
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:22,490
accept it push it into the database

1024
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:25,759
it'll get done on their back-end they'll

1025
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:27,618
push it back out and to get some hour at

1026
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,930
the top of the hour or whatever they'll

1027
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:32,510
also publish it on the web site and it

1028
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:36,098
will exist and that's it a CV has been

1029
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:38,450
born as you can see we need automation

1030
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:40,809
we need to do a whole lot of things but

1031
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:43,549
if I told you what the situation was

1032
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:46,640
five years ago you would cry and throw

1033
00:42:43,549 --> 00:42:47,580
stuff at me but like I said we're

1034
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,640
working on this

1035
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:52,470
and if you're not into like the whole US

1036
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,850
government news tracking they're

1037
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:55,680
currently going through a kerfuffle

1038
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:58,170
because for example the CV project

1039
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,060
doesn't have reliable funding right they

1040
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,770
they're on a project funding basis

1041
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,540
rather than like every year we're

1042
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:05,730
actually gonna probably give you money

1043
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:08,640
it's like a very maybe it happens maybe

1044
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:10,230
it doesn't type a thing right now so

1045
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,960
hopefully CV becomes a bit more healthy

1046
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:15,660
and a little bit more reliable because

1047
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,000
like I said right now it runs on a bunch

1048
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:19,980
of people like most open source projects

1049
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,810
who like try it you know we're trying to

1050
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:23,460
do the right thing but we also have

1051
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:25,950
lives and vacations and like get sick

1052
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:27,090
and stuff we're trying to automate it

1053
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:28,859
you know we've got a bunch of projects

1054
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:32,160
around the CV user registry so who all

1055
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:33,810
is involved in this how do you like how

1056
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,040
do you contact them right that's a huge

1057
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:37,380
problem right you find a vulnerability

1058
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,640
in something how the heck do you get

1059
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:41,340
ahold of the person in charge of it

1060
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,810
right you go through if anybody here has

1061
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:45,510
ever found of you know a flaw in a

1062
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:47,040
corporate piece of software who here's

1063
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:48,330
tried to talk to corporate frontline

1064
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,810
support about a security flaw and

1065
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:55,799
reported right yeah like take a shot you

1066
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:58,410
know it's it's misery it's horrible so

1067
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,330
we want to you know have like like Red

1068
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:03,240
Hat very simple you email second look at

1069
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:05,700
Red Hat calm and a human being reviews

1070
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,200
it and we had some very tight essays on

1071
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,879
when we had to deal with it when we had

1072
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,310
to reply you know and that reply might

1073
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,470
be like thanks but no but at least a

1074
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:15,390
human being saw it right like there's

1075
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:18,540
other vendors where you email them stuff

1076
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:21,810
and I don't know what happens to it like

1077
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:25,470
good luck that's all I can say so yeah

1078
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:27,990
that was a CV being born um so I guess

1079
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:31,770
with that I'm basically yeah there we go

1080
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:43,319
perfect oh right on time so the demo

1081
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:45,270
went well thank goodness so quick

1082
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:48,300
question so you want to be a CNA a cv

1083
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:49,620
numbering authority right now in the

1084
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,630
open source world so for example we have

1085
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:55,080
kubernetes is one I'm currently minting

1086
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:58,260
a couple like Jenkins and I want to say

1087
00:44:55,080 --> 00:45:01,230
PHP but if you want to be a CV numbering

1088
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:03,240
authority for your software or prod

1089
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:05,369
that you're involved in I'm trying to

1090
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:08,669
make that easier it's still very manual

1091
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:10,170
and a bad process so I'm also looking

1092
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:11,609
for guinea pigs because I'm trying to

1093
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:14,430
streamline the process and find out sort

1094
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:15,720
of what's the minimum viable product so

1095
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:17,009
one thing I realized for example is I

1096
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,990
don't necessarily actually need to train

1097
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:20,850
you on all the CV stuff you can find

1098
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:22,649
what we're gonna call is a CV mentor you

1099
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,520
know somebody who knows see the ease and

1100
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:25,350
knows how to handle it

1101
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,520
so you would basically go to them and

1102
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:28,350
say I think I found a security flaw

1103
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,090
let's do the CV song-and-dance and they

1104
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:31,618
would help you do that you know they'd

1105
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:33,420
hope you bundle up the CV request to

1106
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:36,570
make it correct like that Python request

1107
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:38,250
was as you can see very quick and easy

1108
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:39,660
to process right because he linked to

1109
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:44,010
all the right information used all the

1110
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:45,359
right words it was all simple so if

1111
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:47,730
anybody's interested in that just please

1112
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:50,160
email me either courtesy for dog or KC

1113
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:53,940
food security lines org it's also on the

1114
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,470
I want to see the org webpage but like I

1115
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,910
said the more CNAs we have the more

1116
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:58,680
distribute it becomes the better

1117
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:00,330
coverage we have and you know that's

1118
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,740
ultimately what we want right my back of

1119
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:03,330
the envelope calculations say we need

1120
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,160
about one to 10 million Seavey's a year

1121
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:07,460
and that would give us a good basic

1122
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:10,230
coverage of the open source world and

1123
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:14,250
like probably 10% of all commercial

1124
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:18,240
software that kind of matters so in

1125
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:19,950
conclusion the current CV system kind of

1126
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,029
works mostly works it's pretty good we

1127
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:22,560
cover the big things that you know

1128
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:25,260
Microsoft does their stuff Red Hat does

1129
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,400
their stuff Oracle does their stuff you

1130
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,350
know I don't agree with the way they do

1131
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,490
it but at least they do it you know it's

1132
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:31,740
better than before where it was just

1133
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:33,618
like you know literally vendors like

1134
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:37,229
Oracle would say like here's a patch

1135
00:46:33,619 --> 00:46:38,940
install it by Tuesday or else like

1136
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:40,080
literally I've seen you know back to the

1137
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,730
day vendors would say things like that

1138
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:44,040
you'd be like why do we need to install

1139
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,750
it by Tuesday like no reason just do it

1140
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,400
really quickly you know and then you

1141
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:50,369
look at your count you're like oh right

1142
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:52,710
Def Con starts Tuesday you know right

1143
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:55,290
like literally it was such a horrible

1144
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:57,930
situation and again you know I also come

1145
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:59,160
from a vendor in past so I I apologize

1146
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:00,810
you know we haven't always made things

1147
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,990
as easy and as nice as we should have

1148
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:05,700
for our customers so with that I guess

1149
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:07,850
question and answers does anybody have

1150
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,850
any questions

1151
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:12,430
I actually have a quick question you

1152
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:14,470
want to tell us a little bit about your

1153
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,520
open social security podcast a little

1154
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:18,939
plug oh sure

1155
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,350
so myself and actually my former manager

1156
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,700
at Red Hat Josh pressors

1157
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:23,940
we do a thing called the open source

1158
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:27,310
security podcast where we talk about

1159
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:30,790
mostly security quite often in an open

1160
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:33,970
source context it's a open source

1161
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:37,810
security podcast comm and it's a weekly

1162
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:39,189
he releases it on Sunday and like for

1163
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:42,070
example we recently did a review of

1164
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:44,740
Bruce Schneier new book too long didn't

1165
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:46,530
read you probably know all of it but he

1166
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:49,330
writes it in a way that is very

1167
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:50,440
approachable to normal people which you

1168
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:54,490
know that's something

1169
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:56,200
yesterday's I guess keynote was you know

1170
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:58,779
how do we talk to normal people like

1171
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:02,259
most of us myself included it's

1172
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:03,760
something we're working on great thank

1173
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:17,620
you any questions from the audience

1174
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:19,690
oh yeah I'm gonna try not to fall the

1175
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:21,790
situation with mitre reminds me a lot of

1176
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:24,580
what the internet went through when it

1177
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:26,860
moved from NIST to ICANN and ITF and

1178
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:29,680
stuff like that so is there any kind of

1179
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:31,690
push to say we need to get mitre into

1180
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,240
its own sort of organization separate

1181
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:36,730
from the US government and not get its

1182
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:39,069
funding and be dependent on that so sort

1183
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:42,310
of um so fundamentally mitre is a

1184
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:43,810
non-profit and they do got US government

1185
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:45,340
contract oversight they have a couple

1186
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:48,640
mandates around security biosecurity

1187
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:49,930
cyber security whatnot um what we're

1188
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,270
doing in CV world is right now

1189
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:54,549
essentially like if mitre loses their

1190
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:57,759
funding from the DHS the CV project

1191
00:48:54,550 --> 00:49:00,220
basically dies right it's not we don't

1192
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,630
have enough of a community yet so you

1193
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,629
know coming from the Red Hat world what

1194
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:06,850
what quite often happens is Red Hat

1195
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:08,620
wants to get these open-source projects

1196
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:10,810
to grow up and stand on their own two

1197
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:14,020
feet and that's where we currently are

1198
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:15,850
with CD is we're basically trying to

1199
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:17,890
sort of D couple ourselves a bit from

1200
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:19,750
mitre so that we're less reliant on them

1201
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:21,970
so part of that is this Federation this

1202
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:23,680
hierarchy which is just removing

1203
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:26,169
the actual day-to-day kind of CV

1204
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,399
handling and management from them from a

1205
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:30,010
governance point of view we're also

1206
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:34,090
working on things to reduce sort of

1207
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:35,619
miters involvement in the sense of like

1208
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:37,840
right now they do most of the heavy

1209
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:40,420
lifting right and because that heavy

1210
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:43,900
lifting costs money and like I don't

1211
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:46,210
have a budget do it you know red net you

1212
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:47,830
know here redhead did it like that's

1213
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:49,480
where I used to work and you know I

1214
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:51,910
spent a lot of time working on CV on

1215
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:53,710
behalf of redhead and redhead you know

1216
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:55,629
Red Hat was responsible for what 15 20

1217
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:58,990
percent of the CV database in total up

1218
00:49:55,630 --> 00:50:00,550
until recently so we need more that open

1219
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:02,830
sourced model where the community stands

1220
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:05,050
on its own but we're a long ways away

1221
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:06,549
from there with similar problems to most

1222
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:08,500
open sources that everybody wants to use

1223
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:10,180
CVE very few people want to contribute

1224
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,830
to it right and it's great that people

1225
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:15,669
use it I want that just like I want

1226
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:16,840
people to use open source but some at

1227
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:18,640
the end of the day somebody has to do

1228
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,130
some programming or some CV assignments

1229
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:24,400
or you know has to do some work so these

1230
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:25,230
are things we're working on and like I

1231
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,099
said there's a current congressional

1232
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:28,030
about their funding where they're like

1233
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:29,589
oh you guys are doing a terrible job

1234
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:31,690
like yeah we kind of are because they're

1235
00:50:29,589 --> 00:50:32,589
funding keeps going away like what do

1236
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:35,260
you want from us

1237
00:50:32,589 --> 00:50:36,580
so they recommended it become a line

1238
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:38,890
item like we just fund this thing every

1239
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:42,160
year right which will improve things

1240
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:44,830
vastly so it's growing up and part of it

1241
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,990
is you know almost nobody knew about CV

1242
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:49,359
up until a few years ago really like it

1243
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:52,118
was a very niche thing but now security

1244
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:53,710
is not a niche right we've created all

1245
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:55,390
this crap plugged it into the internet

1246
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:57,550
and discovered whoops now we need to

1247
00:50:55,390 --> 00:51:01,240
update it how do we track that right how

1248
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:04,270
bad is it we don't know so I'm thinking

1249
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:06,609
probably within five years CVE will the

1250
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:11,730
CVE community will be able to largely

1251
00:51:06,609 --> 00:51:11,730
stand on its own feet okay thanks

1252
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:18,049
any other questions oh yeah

1253
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,100
first of all what does that mean to you

1254
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:35,520
so I have probably five positions on

1255
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:37,640
that so disclaimer I worked for red head

1256
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,720
of product security for seven years

1257
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,890
prior to that I worked for eyesight eye

1258
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:45,209
defense which were vulnerability

1259
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:47,819
aggregation companies um so in a perfect

1260
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:49,260
world with spherical cows people would

1261
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,550
do the right thing not just the people

1262
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,410
finding the vulnerabilities but the

1263
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:54,570
people responsible for the software with

1264
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:56,160
the vulnerabilities we don't live in

1265
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:58,260
that way there's a lot of economic and

1266
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,500
market forces that basically say haha I

1267
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:03,540
sold you something and you no backsies

1268
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:05,220
like why would I support it no backsies

1269
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:07,100
right I got your money it sucks to be

1270
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:10,109
you

1271
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:12,210
so you know on the one hand I wish every

1272
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:14,040
researcher responsibly took the time to

1273
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:15,990
go to the company work with the company

1274
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:18,870
you know within a reasonable timeframe

1275
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:20,759
get it fixed blah blah blah but like

1276
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:24,029
there's just some evil drug companies

1277
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:26,040
out there or you know last year Ford in

1278
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:28,890
a couple large car companies actually

1279
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:30,300
came out and said we won't sue you if

1280
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:32,430
you bring the security vulnerability to

1281
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:34,500
us and I was like oh that's actually

1282
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:37,109
progress like straight up that's

1283
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,760
progress no there's a lot of industries

1284
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:39,930
like in a lot of the world if you find a

1285
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,090
flaw in your bank's website what do you

1286
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:45,750
do the correct answer is nothing you

1287
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:47,180
don't tell them right because the costs

1288
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:51,390
will show up and take all your stuff

1289
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:54,029
right you know so I would say like many

1290
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:55,650
things iterated prisoner's don't try to

1291
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:57,570
do the right thing please do the right

1292
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:59,400
thing and if that doesn't work

1293
00:52:57,570 --> 00:53:01,830
to quote Troy Hunt you know we talked to

1294
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,630
last week about the value of public

1295
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:06,120
shaming of companies with bad security

1296
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:08,760
yeah the reality is that's what you need

1297
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:10,140
to do to some companies I would also say

1298
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,670
maybe look at the company's track record

1299
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:13,259
right some companies might have a

1300
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:14,400
legitimate need to be like oh god that

1301
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:16,050
that's gonna take like three or six

1302
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,850
months or a great example being this

1303
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:19,470
Intel stuff right like yeah software

1304
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:21,900
sure we can fix that but like ah it's

1305
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:24,629
hardware now and we need the hardware

1306
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,630
vendor well ultimately we dip the

1307
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:27,250
Ruhlman still

1308
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:29,740
we also need micro patches in the

1309
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:32,339
meantime and we need the vendors to like

1310
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:34,779
fix all their linux kernel's like and

1311
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:37,150
like many of these complicated problems

1312
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:38,800
we start looking into it and all of a

1313
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:40,089
sudden it goes from like oh you know

1314
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,730
somebody proposed this problem with this

1315
00:53:40,089 --> 00:53:44,319
solution turns out it's way worse than

1316
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:47,800
we thought it's you know a million times

1317
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,940
more complicated so you know we're gonna

1318
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,200
need six months or a year right

1319
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:53,470
everybody complains about how long

1320
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:55,359
spectrin meltdown were in private yeah

1321
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:57,250
it had to be like there were so many

1322
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:59,049
engineers working on it and so many

1323
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:02,319
people at so many companies dealing with

1324
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:04,059
this and we still didn't do like what I

1325
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:06,880
would say we didn't do a great job we

1326
00:54:04,059 --> 00:54:10,359
did an okay job ideally what happens is

1327
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,550
like with a stack guard flaw we had it

1328
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:14,049
private for about it was five months or

1329
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:16,480
something you know and Florian found

1330
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:18,220
like a whole can of worms and did a

1331
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,910
whole bunch of hardening and changes to

1332
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:23,558
GFC in addition to fixing the flaws and

1333
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:26,440
then the day hit we rolled out the

1334
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:28,000
updates nothing happened right no press

1335
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,040
everybody installed the updates and life

1336
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,890
went on and ideally that's what happens

1337
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:34,930
right it's you know oh

1338
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:36,220
all these tires might blow up or

1339
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:38,109
whatever so just you know go to the

1340
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:40,689
garage get your tire swapped boom done

1341
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:42,220
we're all good so as far as responsible

1342
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:44,890
disclosure goes like yeah I would

1343
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:46,390
encourage people to be nice but

1344
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:50,410
fundamentally that doesn't always work

1345
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:52,000
and also I would say you know protect

1346
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:53,859
yourself right because some companies

1347
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,079
and organizations will come down on you

1348
00:54:53,859 --> 00:55:00,308
like a bag of hammers if you give them

1349
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:04,420
bad news which is unfortunate but it is

1350
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:05,980
the world we live in great well thanks

1351
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:09,260
Kurt that's all the time we have for

1352
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:11,320
questions round of applause for Kurt

1353
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,320
