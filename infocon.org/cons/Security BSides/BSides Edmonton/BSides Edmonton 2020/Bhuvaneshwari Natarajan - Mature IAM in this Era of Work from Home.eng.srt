bhuvana has been working in different

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,920
phase of cyber security implementation

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,079
consulting and operations management

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,880

the diverse need of multiple verticals

15
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,399
within the cyber security she has

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,760

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,760
management projects across north america

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,640
bhuvana's primary area of interest

20

include

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,000
operation management and identifying and

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,960
improving the maturity of a given

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,560
landscape based on risk assessment

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,600
uh bhuvana topic for

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,920

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,400
era of work from home i think this is a

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,600
really really good topic

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,920
uh and we need to have discussion on

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,679
this

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:30,560
uh like you know um so hand it over to

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,880
for giving me this opportunity to

37
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,119
present on this topic

38
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,280
so i'll get started with a brief

39
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,479
introduction about myself

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,079
um so

41
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:56,000
this is how i got into cyber security it

42
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,759
was not exactly the

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,119
uh you know this is precisely what i

44
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,840
want to do in my life kind of

45
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,520
a goal but this is how i got in i kept

46
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,960
saying and then god said okay go into

47
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,679
cyber security and everything is going

48
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,199
to be uh

49
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,800
fine uh and ever since after i finished

50
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,280
my college i got into uh

51
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,040
wipro and uh for a year i was in

52
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,720
induction and testing and then for 11

53
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,799
years i did just identity and access

54
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,480
management in various capacities

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,080
and i started off with the developer and

56
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,640
it has really given me a very good hold

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,200
on you know

58
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,480
uh what the customer wants you know like

59
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,079
what are the issues that can happen at

60
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,079
the grassroot level i did a little bit

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,040
of operations too and then i moved into

62
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,200
uh

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,400
leading and then consulting and finally

64
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,480
uh managing uh

65
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,840
identity and access management projects

66
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,359
and further on i moved

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,800
into cyber security management and the

68
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,599
last three years have been about uh

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,599
managing

70
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,480
uh you know cyber security for one of

71
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,720
the one of our clients here

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,440
so uh as we all know cyber security is

73
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,680
kind of

74
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,280
pretty uh huge uh spans across

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,800
everything that's infra and everything

76
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,560
that's applications

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,159
and there are so many physiques of

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,879
cybersecurity right

79
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,599
and uh the one area that i'm kind of

80
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,959
good at

81
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,799
is identity and access management and

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,159
so when hanny asked me can you talk on

83
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,519
this topic i was yeah

84
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,159
definitely i mean it's something that i

85
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,280
really like a lot i know something about

86
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,079
so when we talk about identity and

87
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,040
access management

88
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,480
again it is not just one thing identity

89
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,400
and access management is

90
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,560
so many sub domains like for instance

91
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,480
you have access management

92
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,319
identity management privileged access

93
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,200
management access governance

94
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,958
and all of this kind of spans across

95
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,879
different types of users like between

96
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,400
users enterprise users consumers

97
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,560
business to business users

98
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,640
you have so many different kinds of ids

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,920
right social ids privileged ids service

100
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,839
id share ids

101
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,200
uh the normal active directory ids that

102
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,280
we generally use

103
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,879
what kind of apps you know against what

104
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,439
kind of apps we are using our

105
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,560
ids and what is the kind of access that

106
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,760
is being provisioned

107
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,760
so when we look at this entire uh when

108
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,480
we look at the entire gamut of what

109
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,120
makes up identity and access management

110
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,359
uh

111
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,519
it is really not a singular thing it's

112
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,400
very plural it's it's so many things put

113
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,080
together

114
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,760
and here one of the things i have not

115
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,080
mentioned and you know one of the things

116
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,760
that kind of gets called out repeatedly

117
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,919
is multifactor authentication it's

118
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,880
usually part of access management

119
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,440
uh but it is taking a life of its own uh

120
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,639
in the

121
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,479
recent past so today

122
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,919
we will be talking i would say that you

123
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,199
would be kind of scratching the surface

124
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,599
you know in terms of

125
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,440
discussing what we can do in this age

126
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,840
era of work from home

127
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,560
um as we move towards a new way of

128
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,599
working what is it going to be like

129
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,520
so let's go to 2019

130
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,639
let's start from there one of the things

131
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,080
i do want to say is

132
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,919
through the meetings today all the

133
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,159
meetings that have happened today or the

134
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,960
uh talks that have happened today most

135
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,520
things

136
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,239
have already been discussed uh people

137
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,359
who have

138
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,360
a lot more uh expertise than me

139
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,840
who have a lot more experience who have

140
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,400
a lot more a much bigger vision of what

141
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,479
they

142
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,679
uh see in the in their organizations

143
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,359
have spoken about

144
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,280
the importance of identity and access

145
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,199
management so

146
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,559
i think my deck is kind of a summary of

147
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,199
many of those points

148
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,360
but we'll go through it nevertheless so

149
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,360
in 2019

150
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,039
even before the pandemic started the

151
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,560
list of people we could trust

152
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,039
was very less and if the cso was lucky

153
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,800
enough

154
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,280
he probably got a multi-million dollar

155
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,039
cyber budget but it is not exactly like

156
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,559
he did not have problems he or she did

157
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,039
not have problems

158
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,199
there were security awareness trainings

159
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,719
and then we had operations teams and you

160
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,280
know project security folks who would

161
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,520
say

162
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,960
no this cannot be done or oh we will not

163
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,719
let you do this or

164
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,400
uh hold on let me think you know what is

165
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,759
the best way to do it

166
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,919
and then that would always be someone

167
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,840
who says i think we need to take care of

168
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,680
every year you know just after the audit

169
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,239
is done i'm sure many of you have faced

170
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,919
this

171
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,520
just after the audit is done or through

172
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,120
the year someone is saying we need to do

173
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,919
access management we need to do it

174
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,400
better

175
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,840
and it's of course not a very simple

176
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,000
thing it's it's something that spans

177
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,000
across everything identity is one aspect

178
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
that kind of goes across everything

179
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,199
infrastructure everything application

180
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,240
related

181
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,919
so we had some people you know skill set

182
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,960
is another very big issue and it is not

183
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,520
something like you know

184
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,680
it's not a shortage point in 2020 in

185
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,039
2019 two there were people

186
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,639
there was limited amount of people who

187
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,000
could actually do full-fledged iem

188
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,319
implementations

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,400
then we had our operations teams and our

190
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,680
system administrators and they would say

191
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,000
let me go ahead and take care of

192
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,880
password management so all these

193
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,039
things kind of existed in 2019 and

194
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,000
alongside security in the overall i.t

195
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,159
landscape

196
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,039
things were already moving from on-prem

197
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,520
to cloud

198
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,440
these things were very much in progress

199
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,719
even in 2019

200
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,319
and frankly even in 2019 things were not

201
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,280
going at you know

202
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,639
i'll go at a normal you know 1x kind of

203
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,520
a speed they were probably people were

204
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,680
making the jump

205
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,359
oh am i in a legacy system then can i

206
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,880
just avoid the intermediate steps and

207
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,400
kind of move into something that's

208
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,800
cloud-based

209
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,599
all those thoughts were already there

210
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,039
and

211
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,280
probably the approvals were coming in

212
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,120
much slower and at that point of course

213
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,520
there was no concern about working from

214
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
home

215
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,880
probably you know the policy documents

216
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,440
the hr policy document said something

217
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,960
like

218
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,199
you'll work from home once uh per week

219
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,840
or once in two months or something like

220
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,360
that we didn't have that concept as

221
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,318
um as rampant as it is today

222
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,199
come 2020 we had the pandemic uh in

223
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,039
march

224
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,599
as you can see it was not a bad start in

225
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,840
terms of

226
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,719
attacks and other things but the first

227
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,239
thing that happened

228
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,080
as soon as you know everyone kind of

229
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,840
settled and decided that oh something

230
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,520
you know we can start looking at or

231
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,560
probably they were preparing in march i

232
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,440
don't know but in 2020 april

233
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,440
the credential phishing kind of shot up

234
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,199
and if you look at this is a key aspect

235
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,120
password management password and today

236
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,879
we have spoken so much about it

237
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,400
even during the panel discussion you

238
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,000
know one of the things was go for

239
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,679
something that is passwordless go for

240
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,280
multi-factor authentication

241
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,720
in the chat section that where we saw

242
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,479
you know there were multiple asks about

243
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,199
multi-factor authentication

244
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,680
so the moment you know we kind of settle

245
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,160
down credential phishing kind of went up

246
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,039
and this kind of shows how important

247
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,960
identity is

248
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,400
and the password and other attributes

249
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,280
associated with um

250
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,239
identity is actually and one of the

251
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,919
other things

252
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,680
that is that was kind of rampant you

253
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,840
know in terms of coronavirus scam has

254
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,360
again been identity theft

255
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,159
uh while all these things did not exist

256
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,479
um i mean did exist in 2019 too the

257
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,120
ramifications if they happen today

258
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,880
are kind of a little more lethal because

259
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,360
people are already vulnerable

260
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,880
and with furloughs and many other things

261
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,240
we don't want to maintain the identity

262
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,800
of a person the integrity of an

263
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,440
organization in a much better fashion

264
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,839
so with all that in mind let us just

265
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,480
take

266
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,200
one use case one example which was the

267
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,040
um

268
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,200
twitter hack that happened uh you know a

269
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,519
few months back

270
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,440
uh and the reason i bring this up is we

271
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,240
want to talk about security awareness

272
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,160
also

273
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,000
today you know as we went through these

274
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,360
multiple discussions we heard how

275
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,760
security awareness is so

276
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,959
important if you look at what happened

277
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,480
in uh

278
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:23,279
the twitter hack primarily they fished

279
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,120
okay that is something you know that is

280
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,439
one aspect of security

281
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,720
but they fished for credentials and then

282
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,399
when the person got

283
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,000
uh when the person gave up his

284
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,480
credentials or you know he

285
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,399
provided the required access it was very

286
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,080
much related to access management it was

287
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,880
very much related to the identity of the

288
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,519
person

289
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,519
and if you look at what the reporters

290
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,160
are talking about

291
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,440
you know you just need to give a and

292
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,800
usually the reporting is

293
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:54,000
a b c d e f g h right and here

294
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,000
twitter said uh we have strictly limited

295
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,800
the access to avoid any kind of problems

296
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,480
we will give the

297
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,319
access at a later point you know we will

298
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,560
start rolling out the access again

299
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,000
but the perception of whatever this

300
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,160
person has written the reporter has

301
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,920
written says uh though they said you

302
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,640
know it is strictly limited and only

303
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,599
granted on

304
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,720
um valid business reasons they also said

305
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,839
you know they have signed them

306
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,480
they have reduced the access

307
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,320
significantly so the organizations go

308
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,040
through some kind of a crisis too right

309
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,200
like

310
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,800
what does the public look at them like

311
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,680
so knowing about

312
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:29,599
all these things i just want to say that

313
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,800
the pandemic though it has changed how

314
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,040
companies work

315
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,920
it is not essentially changing what they

316
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,399
create

317
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,000
it is not changing what the companies

318
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,680
provide to the consumers

319
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,079
so basically when you look at the entire

320
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,199
iem landscape or even most other aspects

321
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,640
of security

322
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,800
you are not looking at a complete

323
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,720
overhaul you're probably look

324
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,760
if you're ideally a mature organization

325
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,120
right you're going to be doing these

326
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,439
three things you're going to be looking

327
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
at

328
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,279
a few of your operational process you're

329
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,880
going to be remodeling a few of them

330
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,240
you're probably going to be upgrading a

331
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,839
little bit of your infra because you're

332
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,440
already on your cloud journey and if you

333
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,360
have the necessary approvals for many

334
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,079
things intra-related and applications

335
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,680
related

336
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,279
you're probably going to be upgrading

337
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,640
very little of your infra

338
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,480
and you're probably going to be

339
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,839
revisiting your audit controls these are

340
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,880
kind of the three things that you will

341
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,279
be doing

342
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,640
but most organizations in spite of all

343
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,399
the things all the changes that have

344
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,240
been happening in the recent past

345
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,440
are probably because of all the changes

346
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,200
that have been happening in the recent

347
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,160
past as they move into cloud

348
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,120
they might not be very mature in each

349
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,240
one of

350
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,920
these points uh uh

351
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,000
a nikita if you could just put up the

352
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,439
poll we can probably you know go through

353
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,440
it towards the end of this meeting

354
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,240
okay i'll just continue with the uh

355
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,240
discussion here

356
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,839
so in terms of expert talk as we go

357
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,680
through multiple uh

358
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,279
discussions right as we go through uh

359
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,959
multiple materials that you know people

360
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,839
where people are opinion on what what

361
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,599
they see

362
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,040
one is obviously the data thefts that

363
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,920
are increasing and

364
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,680
uh in spite of you know having or moving

365
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,199
towards a cloud-based environment

366
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,800
uh there are still restrictions because

367
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,480
most of your active directory is still

368
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,519
on prem not everyone has moved into

369
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,360
azure already

370
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,480
uh or probably you know you were just

371
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,160
beginning your journey and you're

372
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,800
nowhere near you know

373
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,959
a proper way of completion i would say

374
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,560
uh privacy concerns we spoke a lot about

375
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,439
privacy concerns today

376
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,279
one good thing is where uh you know um

377
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,760
i'm sorry i don't remember her name

378
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,959
um where she just mentioned didn't see

379
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,240
as many number of

380
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,680
uh hacks or as many number of uh threats

381
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,279
as they expected to see which is

382
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,519
kind of a good thing to actually know

383
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,040
you know uh the other thing is concerns

384
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,440
on the strength of the network

385
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,599
mostly because we were still operating

386
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,360
in an on-prem model we still had on-prem

387
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,240
controls we had a lot of on-prem

388
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,760
controls

389
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,360
and we were just beginning to think

390
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,560
about how do we mature it into a

391
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,600
cloud-based control

392
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,359
and we are not there still but

393
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,720
knowing that the spend is not going to

394
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,320
be extremely great

395
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,240
knowing that you know even companies and

396
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,399
businesses are controlling their

397
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,600
spend uh what we do here is the i.t

398
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,440
spend is going to be

399
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,040
relatively neutral yeah there are a lot

400
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,000
of projections on how much is going to

401
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,000
be spent

402
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,240
yes it will be spent over a period of

403
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,240
time but having said that

404
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,240
where they will spend it what is the

405
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,320
area where they want to focus on

406
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,480
that is still you know kind of neutral

407
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,480
and security is not the only area where

408
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,200
they will be pushing in their money

409
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,000
now knowing about all these things what

410
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,079
is different

411
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,839
what is different between 2019 and why

412
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,599
should we be having this conversation in

413
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,839
2020 right

414
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,160
this is something uh you know one of our

415
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,160
very senior managers had uh said a long

416
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,399
time back

417
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,079
organizational inertia is an all-time

418
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,760
low and i really love those words you

419
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,160
know the inertia that you have in an

420
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,760
organization bringing 20 people together

421
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,199
and then they are focusing on what is

422
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,560
key to them and then you know they take

423
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,560
a period of time to decide what is

424
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,319
important no right now it goes

425
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,399
i have this thing you know wherever the

426
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,320
security they have that

427
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,399
thought in their head you know that uh

428
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,040
that pebble in their head that says

429
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,880
no you cannot wait no this cannot wait

430
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,439
you need to make that change

431
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,360
so they have that mindset right now and

432
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,279
when you have that mindset now

433
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,880
uh the inertia kind of becomes very less

434
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,360
and adaptability is going to be very

435
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,199
high

436
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,800
like for instance i remember in one of

437
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,040
my previous uh

438
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,160
projects um there was this person who

439
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,079
would come in and say

440
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,600
two-factor authentication is privileged

441
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,000
access management

442
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,320
it used to be so difficult i mean that

443
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,279
person was so set in his ways and it was

444
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,519
so difficult to

445
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,399
make that move but right now it is not

446
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,360
like that

447
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,399
now we have a lot of support from people

448
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,399
who are kind of you know

449
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,600
us higher up they want to know about it

450
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,639
and one of the points that was said

451
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,040
today

452
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,720
senior folks understand security as a

453
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,079
matter of fact today when security does

454
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,480
not sit at the table

455
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,239
people on top ask where is this person

456
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,320
where is the ciso or where is the

457
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,279
security architect that question does

458
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,920
arise

459
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:57,839
and now what we can do is we see

460
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,120
large vendors like let's say microsoft

461
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,680
or google many such

462
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,839
organizations whose suites we already

463
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,359
use in our organization they are already

464
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,760
providing a lot of cloud-based

465
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,040
applications can we move towards it

466
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,240
can we consolidate all of our on-prem

467
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,920
tools that we use for iam and leverage

468
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,480
microsoft or any other

469
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,839
uh you know google or any other suite

470
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,199
that is something we want to look at and

471
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,480
that is what is kind of different

472
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,079
in 2020 uh the lack of inertia and the

473
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,360
availability of these suits that can

474
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,199
help us actually make

475
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,880
a jump now knowing this

476
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,680
one of the key things i do want to talk

477
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,480
about is in march 2020

478
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,519
we were at we need to work from home we

479
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,600
were doing

480
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,440
i would say very quick risk assessments

481
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,720
smaller team like for instance

482
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,480
a rollout of vpn was happening like this

483
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,720
you know in the snap of a finger

484
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,680
do a risk assessment do your vpn roll

485
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,639
out or

486
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,758
uh our laptops and computers or the

487
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,279
desktops and the

488
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,800
office would probably never go home but

489
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,360
all of a sudden we were sending it home

490
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,199
right

491
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,880
and we were uh probably pushing

492
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,680
bitlocker and many other things

493
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,519
very fast but now the question you know

494
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,439
so many months into the pandemic

495
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,959
and when we have started talking about

496
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,480
can we return to work

497
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,239
the discussion is going to be more

498
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,199
around what percent of folks do we need

499
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,440
in the office

500
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,880
can we enable remote working permanently

501
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,880
for certain positions

502
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,320
or and the most important thing right

503
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,880
something that actually

504
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,440
uh uh touches dinner with the business

505
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,720
too

506
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,040
can we save on office space right

507
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,079
because it's uh cost saving for most of

508
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,800
the organizations at the moment and

509
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,399
seriously

510
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,479
organizations do worry about their

511
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,320
employees and if they can have their

512
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,600
employees working from home

513
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,440
when they just give up a little bit of

514
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,959
their office space why not

515
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,120
right so using all these

516
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,638
thoughts or all these parameters it is

517
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,160
now possible for us

518
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,000
to dust whatever um plans or

519
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,439
propositions we had previously right

520
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,120
proposals we prepared most of the

521
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,759
security folks i have seen you know in

522
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,320
the past

523
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,240
uh we prepare business cases we prepare

524
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,079
so many business cases for identity and

525
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,839
access management for uh

526
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,359
i want to move into cloud and we have

527
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,760
this on-prem solution

528
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,559
or i want to consolidate uh i want to

529
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,559
move into a new edr solution

530
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,559
we just did not have that leverage we

531
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,879
were just not able to provide

532
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,399
uh what the i mean provide reasons on

533
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,600
what the roi would be

534
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,319
but right now we have that uh lever so

535
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,639
using all that it would be good to sign

536
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,840
off

537
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,440
sign on i mean revisit our proposals get

538
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,320
a sign off on cloud-based long-term

539
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,160
solutions

540
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,559
and also consolidate what we have on

541
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,320
on-prem so this new normal is going to

542
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,280
be kind of a lever that lets us

543
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:44,240
move into um newer ways of working with

544
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,918
identity and access management

545
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,559
now having said this and my screen won't

546
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,200
move

547
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,200
i don't know why

548
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,000
ah what's happening

549
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:02,799
[Music]

550
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,799
just a moment okay

551
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,799
so this was something i thought i should

552
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,280
add mostly because at the beginning of

553
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,799
the

554
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,480
pandemic ride um this is this is more to

555
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,240
do with business continuity than the

556
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,000
pandemic itself and probably in the

557
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,000
future we want to have our

558
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,200
uh business continuity documents kind of

559
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,039
updated with these

560
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,280
important points right uh when

561
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,480
when the pandemic struck and we started

562
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,399
doing operations

563
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,000
a few things that we did not think about

564
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,600
right um

565
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,520
collaboration especially collaboration

566
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,760
with the hr to understand what change

567
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,120
they are undergoing in terms of

568
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,799
onboarding their folks

569
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,120
today if we have a certain way of

570
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,720
onboarding folks into our environment

571
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,918
how is it going to be you know when they

572
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,280
are going to run their background

573
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,840
verification is there going to be a

574
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,080
delay

575
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,600
so having all those conversations with

576
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,678
your supporting teams

577
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,639
all that was something uh we had to

578
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,640
consider

579
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,000
remote access provisioning and vpn

580
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,320
access provisioning those

581
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,840
uh those service requests kind of uh

582
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,080
went up in number

583
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,600
uh then in terms of functional access

584
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,000
requirement i don't think that

585
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,959
there was much of a change at all um the

586
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,240
only thing was

587
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,919
uh probably you know we were going for

588
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,760
more blanket approvals because we knew

589
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,559
we had to uh

590
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,320
kind of you know we knew that we had to

591
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,280
provision access to so many people

592
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,879
but in terms of uh who's going to have

593
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,399
access to this particular feature this

594
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,160
particular page in this application

595
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,000
that did not have any kind of change so

596
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,480
these were aspects that did not change

597
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,320
you know even after the onset of the uh

598
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,760
pandemic or even as we work from home it

599
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,399
will not change

600
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,679
what did see a lot of change however was

601
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,280
access management

602
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,320
this one was more towards identity

603
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,399
management access management in terms of

604
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,399
how are we accessing the application

605
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,919
that underwent a lot of change

606
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,760
how are you accessing your remote

607
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,919
desktops do you need to access your

608
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,559
remote desktops do you need to sign into

609
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,919
your

610
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:56,000
corporate environment signing into the

611
00:19:53,919 --> 00:20:00,000
corporate environment now that became

612
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,280
a pretty big topic i would say because

613
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,360
our environments are not always

614
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,399
necessarily built to pick up that amount

615
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,120
of volume

616
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,679
so in that case how are we going to

617
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,280
enable

618
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,039
single sign-on and how are we going to

619
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,320
enable split tunneling and json was

620
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,760
speaking about it this morning you know

621
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,639
how split tunneling is an important

622
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,080
factor

623
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,600
uh that would have been uh that would

624
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,280
have been a very important factor in

625
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,439
most organizations right

626
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,320
so how are we going to handle all of

627
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,919
those things

628
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,559
how are we going to onboard more

629
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,080
applications into you know whatever your

630
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,480
access management tool is for instance

631
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,280
if it's octa how are you going to move

632
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,039
into it

633
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,480
did you have the base information to

634
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,879
contextualize and

635
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,400
take risk-based decisions on it how are

636
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,559
you going to mandate mfa

637
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,240
i remember a time when one or two years

638
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,320
ago you know even within

639
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,240
the company i worked for and the

640
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,960
multiple other clients mfa was something

641
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,200
seen as a

642
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,120
was seen as an inconvenience today

643
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,360
people ask for mfa

644
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,959
password is no longer sufficient frankly

645
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,600
when a password research request comes

646
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,080
it's like

647
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,678
do we still have this problem right

648
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,760
because you have so many means of

649
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,039
going passwordless you can go for smart

650
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,640
devices you can go for google

651
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,440
authenticators you can go for

652
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,720
multiple other ways of achieving the how

653
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,880
what and

654
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,159
something you have something uh you know

655
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,320
and other things right

656
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,679
so all these are discussions we should

657
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,520
be having and we'll talk about it

658
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,320
momentarily

659
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,720
what is the permitted authorization core

660
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,480
screen

661
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,000
authorization that we see here in terms

662
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,640
of authentication is something

663
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
that was discussed in detail

664
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,520
fine-grained authorization to

665
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,720
applications was not something that

666
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,799
underwent a huge change

667
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,480
people were still doing their work if

668
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,600
anything a few people unfortunately were

669
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,159
losing their jobs but

670
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,678
mostly this did not change in terms of

671
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,240
siem monitoring

672
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,960
so both for authentication and siem

673
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,039
monitoring

674
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,520
there were two important things one is

675
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:50,960
bringing a context and risk-based

676
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:53,280
uh perception you know or a risk-based

677
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,360
uh decision making so in terms of static

678
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,280
rules we probably already had it

679
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,120
but in terms of dynamic rules what can

680
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,280
we bring in and that is where the whole

681
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,120
concept of do you know your organization

682
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,399
have you put it all in the cmdb all

683
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,280
those things kind of start coming into

684
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,120
the picture

685
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,879
where all does your company operate what

686
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,678
all geographies do your is your company

687
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,440
working on

688
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,799
if a person is working based out of

689
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,840
let's say africa

690
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,360
and you know you just say no i'm because

691
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,520
pandemic happened and i'm going to

692
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,039
restrict all access to let's say

693
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,158
uh africa and uh uk because i think my

694
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,320
crowd is only in

695
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,120
canada i mean that's just not correct

696
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,678
right so minor things like that kind of

697
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,039
became uh important when we started

698
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,600
looking into authentication

699
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,840
and uh sim monitoring access

700
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,918
recertifications

701
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,760
this is anyways a part and parcel of

702
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,679
every year's audit every year's work

703
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,360
that an organization does but

704
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,960
at the start of the pandemic looking at

705
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,039
as they started working from home

706
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,080
right looking at who has global domain

707
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,919
admin access

708
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,000
local admin how many people have local

709
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,080
admin access security tools

710
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,080
we'll talk a little more about local

711
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,120
admins and you know application lists

712
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,799
and other things in the slides to come

713
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,239
what kind of security tools do we have

714
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,000
what kind of infra tools and

715
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,799
applications do these people have access

716
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,799
to

717
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,559
all those should have been revisited by

718
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,600
now you should have taken a look at it

719
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,000
at least to see

720
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,959
or know what amount of risk we are

721
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,320
having in our

722
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,360
bucket the next thing is around

723
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:25,120
privileged access management

724
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,678
uh you know i don't mean it in a bad way

725
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,559
but

726
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,960
i don't know that europe has always kind

727
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,559
of

728
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,559
you know carried the baton in terms of

729
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,720
identity and access management

730
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,000
they were the first set of folks who did

731
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,600
identity management very

732
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,039
well they did privileged access

733
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,600
management very well

734
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,120
um and even as we were saying like

735
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,039
because i was from an mssp

736
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,320
uh uh company i could see that

737
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,760
most of our identity and access

738
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,399
management projects were coming from

739
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,960
europe

740
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,480
first before it started coming from usa

741
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,480
uh and then the privileged access

742
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,559
management projects they started

743
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,400
ripping in a lot more earlier than they

744
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,639
did from the north american geography

745
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,080
but right now i think the gap is kind of

746
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,000
closing very fast

747
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,918
but if the organization presently does

748
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,360
not have privileged access management

749
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,880
it's high time to implement it

750
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,799
one of the biggest things that we have

751
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,240
been talking about today

752
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,679
what we should be doing in the future

753
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,640
and this is kind of where we are

754
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,159
starting on the

755
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,600
meat of the topic and i think i have

756
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:26,240
another um

757
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,840
what 15 minutes of yeah 15 minutes so

758
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,880
i'll

759
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,520
go through this a little fast yeah

760
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,080
security awareness even this morning on

761
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,760
the chat

762
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,678
these were the questions right how do we

763
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,600
do security awareness

764
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,440
one thing that i do notice especially

765
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,279
for identity and access management and

766
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,520
this is where the twitter example also

767
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:48,720
kind of comes into the picture

768
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,559
we talk about training our

769
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,480
business folks a lot we talk about

770
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,240
training our employees a lot

771
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,159
but there needs to be special training

772
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,559
for people who are part and parcel of

773
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,679
your security team your analyst your l1

774
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,000
analyst your l2

775
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,880
analyst they are not subject matter

776
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,960
experts

777
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,960
they are not architects they don't

778
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,960
always think from the perspective of

779
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,520
you know is this a safe thing to do they

780
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,279
are they are following your standard

781
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,840
operating procedure documents

782
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,640
so you might want to give them special

783
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,320
training

784
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,000
because i have seen people losing their

785
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,678
job when

786
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,120
you know they do something really bad i

787
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,400
mean they they probably thought it's the

788
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,799
right thing like for instance a major

789
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,559
incident has happening are going ongoing

790
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,000
or you know let's say a seven incident

791
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,279
is ongoing and

792
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,799
without thinking twice they just

793
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,039
provision access and something goes

794
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,039
wrong

795
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,600
we need to provide them the guidance to

796
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:44,159
tell them even though it is so

797
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,199
take a step back during major incidents

798
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,799
or during

799
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,320
you know your seventh is when you want

800
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,559
to be a little more careful

801
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,240
and we need to train them and when we

802
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,720
train them repeatedly on it

803
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,240
it becomes easy they are not looking

804
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,520
here and there for guidance they know

805
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,120
where to go for guidance

806
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,360
i think that's kind of something we want

807
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,279
to focus on tell them what the risk is

808
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,520
what is the impact of the organization

809
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:08,159
and also consequences to the employees

810
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,799
not in terms of scaring them but in

811
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,240
terms of

812
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,080
keeping them aware uh

813
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,760
this is more like my personal point of

814
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,559
view i'm sure there are very

815
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,279
nice ways of doing it uh but it's more

816
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,960
like what

817
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,000
should be happening in terms of roadmap

818
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,960
priorities for

819
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,520
any organization during uh as we move to

820
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,760
the

821
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,039
work from home kind of a model right

822
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,320
there's obviously going to be some

823
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,520
amount of work from office and there's

824
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,639
going to be some amount of work from

825
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,240
home but there's going to be

826
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,880
a big portion of folks who are going to

827
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,279
say of course i can do my work from home

828
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,240
and a big chunk of the senior management

829
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,600
that's going to say

830
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,360
yeah let them work from home we have

831
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,760
seen it works we know it's where it's

832
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,520
not that bad we know it is safe enough

833
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,158
uh why don't we just create controls

834
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,400
around it and at that point

835
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,679
what should our priorities be the first

836
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,760
priority will obviously be

837
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,919
authentication and authorization

838
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,200
the second one will be adaptive

839
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,960
authentication

840
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,720
uh third one being privileged access

841
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,480
management and fourth one is user

842
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,120
lifecycle management again this is

843
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,000
my order of you know how i would build a

844
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,158
roadmap

845
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
or how i would prioritize things of

846
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,760
course many of this will overlap

847
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,960
but what would i start with i would

848
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,600
start with authentication and

849
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,399
authorization

850
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,360
in terms of an environment um an

851
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,559
environment assessment in order to

852
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,559
you know kind of address these

853
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,480
priorities we want to start off with our

854
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,000
environment assessments of course this

855
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,480
is not going to be

856
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,480
um you know the normal consulting

857
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,240
exercise where we are talking about

858
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,559
i want to move from this technology to

859
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,559
that technology we are now talking about

860
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,559
redefining boundaries we are talking

861
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:47,918
about how do i go from

862
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,918
i was so protected to i'm probably going

863
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,799
to go all the internet or i'm probably

864
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,919
going to go

865
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,120
90 percent internet and 10 is going to

866
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,640
be something that's very

867
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,080
important critical right like i'm gonna

868
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,039
go for a four factor authentication or

869
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,799
something like that

870
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,200
and that has to happen in my corporate

871
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,918
environment so when the discussion is

872
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,520
something around that you might want to

873
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,320
consider what type of users you're

874
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,000
talking about

875
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,678
what type of applications you're talking

876
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,080
about

877
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,279
how is your infrastructure going to look

878
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,000
like because

879
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,120
identity is not siloed identity runs

880
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,399
across

881
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,879
laptops in fros applications we just

882
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,320
span across things so when we are just

883
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,240
panning across things

884
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,120
we want to see what we have as a base

885
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,039
too and based on what we have as a base

886
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,600
provide recommendations here and also

887
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:39,360
make our roadmap according to that

888
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,840
one of the simple and i would say

889
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,879
one of the use cases we came against and

890
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,639
something we were not

891
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,640
necessarily thinking about was session

892
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,480
management in o365

893
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,919
during furloughs we let go of people and

894
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,919
then we realized

895
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,200
they are they were still online after we

896
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,360
terminated their access

897
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,399
their session was still on and then we

898
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,039
realized

899
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,799
oops what do we do about this it's

900
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,600
probably a very minor thing

901
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,960
but it is not so minor you know uh

902
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,840
depending on the kind of person we are

903
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,880
letting go

904
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,600
so all these minor points critical

905
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,000
points

906
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,719
might need some amount of rethinking

907
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,200
because

908
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,480
previously when you turned it off in

909
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,159
active directory

910
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,600
probably everything got turned off right

911
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,039
now that is not the case so

912
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,120
that's something that you might want to

913
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,720
look at

914
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,439
uh also in terms of after you finish the

915
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,360
assessment you're

916
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,960
going to arrive at one of these maturity

917
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,520
states right like within the security

918
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,039
team

919
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,799
you're going to be able to say i'm

920
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,480
completely on manual identity and access

921
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,320
management i'm probably in automated

922
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,399
identity and access management

923
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,240
or my organization is already in a

924
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:45,120
risk-based mode of working and

925
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,039
my tools support whatever i want to do

926
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,760
in terms of risk whatever i want to do

927
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,000
in terms of

928
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,559
context right this is kind of where

929
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,159
ideally you should be right now

930
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,678
many organizations are already

931
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,960
especially the bigger organizations or

932
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,720
the ones that have regulatory

933
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,120
requirements are already moving towards

934
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,039
ai-based management not an identity

935
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,879
management but more in access management

936
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,480
that's where you know your adaptive

937
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,720
authentication and all those things kind

938
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:12,080
of come into the picture

939
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,960
but having said that there are very many

940
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,720
organizations and

941
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,559
i'm not talking just about mom and pop

942
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,600
shops i'm talking about even bigger

943
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,520
organizations

944
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,240
where they are mostly into manual

945
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,760
identity and access management you might

946
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,200
want to consider switching all the way

947
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,799
from manual identity and access

948
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,799
management to other risk based

949
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,039
or a completely ai based access

950
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,960
management there are so many

951
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,080
tools there are so many technology

952
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,919
vendors that can

953
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,360
help you with this and the features they

954
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,279
have in their product

955
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,959
are sufficient for you to derive use

956
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,480
cases even

957
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,840
see when they build a product they are

958
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,279
building it around use cases that

959
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,080
different

960
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,360
uh you know companies have or different

961
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,199
verticals have

962
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,479
you can always derive it from there and

963
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,720
choose something as a

964
00:30:52,480 --> 00:31:01,120
best way to go forward now knowing this

965
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,799
after you have arrived at this the

966
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,879
the next step would ideally be drawing

967
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,840
your road map your

968
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,360
identity and access road now now this

969
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,480
can sound very cliche

970
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,719
but you definitely want to start with

971
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,159
the zero truss framework zero truss

972
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,559
framework is not something that we want

973
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,279
to

974
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,559
pull impose on just intro security right

975
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,279
it's not something that you

976
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,799
want to impose on just one application

977
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:28,159
security or infrastructure

978
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:31,039
it's across identities too and

979
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,559
the best part about it is in identity

980
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,799
and access management

981
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,918
everything has already i mean we have

982
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,480
always built our

983
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,440
history on this trusted identity have

984
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,200
just one id

985
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,919
using which you can track all the other

986
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,679
ids if i do something to this id

987
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,159
the rest of the ids should know that you

988
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,480
know they have to do a relevant activity

989
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,720
build that kind of a trusted environment

990
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,720
plan your roadmap according to that

991
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,080
zero trust authentication you want to

992
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,320
move towards risk and you know

993
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,039
contextual based authorization like

994
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,399
um you know with work from home let us

995
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,879
say right

996
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,479
uh i choose to work anytime i want

997
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,720
sometimes i work in the evening

998
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,399
uh you know my friend might choose to

999
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,080
work late in the night because

1000
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,760
uh oh let's say you know he just had a

1001
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,960
baby he's able to work only during night

1002
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,080
hours

1003
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,399
we need to allow for that kind of

1004
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,080
uh elasticity you know flexibility and

1005
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,600
when we set up our policies our dynamic

1006
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,678
policies and other things so

1007
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,279
how do we build a zero trust environment

1008
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,760
but with enough flexibility

1009
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,399
to let the business keep running right

1010
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,399
so

1011
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,678
we'll start with this and doctor has

1012
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,918
given us a very good

1013
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,240
a logical point i mean a logical diagram

1014
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,120
on where we want to be

1015
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,840
if you look at uh where they are saying

1016
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,158
your stage 0 is fragmented ids

1017
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,840
unfortunately many organizations with

1018
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,679
legacy systems

1019
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,519
are still here at least partially here

1020
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,640
if not fully here at least partially

1021
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,279
they are here

1022
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,480
and at some point you might either want

1023
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,159
to move away from those legacy

1024
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,840
applications and as part of that project

1025
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,880
consolidate everything

1026
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,720
or kind of set up a project to

1027
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,039
bring this all together then you have

1028
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,159
unified iam this is where most people

1029
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,158
are already

1030
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,200
contextual access this is when we are

1031
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,760
all moving towards

1032
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,200
adaptive workforce this is more like you

1033
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,799
know occasion or something you are just

1034
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,840
improving over a period of time we just

1035
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,679
keep doing it

1036
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,519
uh minor improvements one percent

1037
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,640
improvements over a period of time

1038
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:27,360
so this is kind of the model

1039
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,240
where we will be moving towards in the

1040
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,760
future

1041
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,159
or we should be moving towards in the

1042
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,158
future

1043
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,760
in terms of identity and access

1044
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,159
management itself

1045
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,519
what do we have as technology roadmap

1046
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,159
what should we have as technology

1047
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,720
roadmap considerations right

1048
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,519
you might want to identify technology

1049
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,360
please don't go for hybrid solutions

1050
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,720
either choose to be with your legacy

1051
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,320
tools or go for something that's

1052
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,399
completely cloud-based

1053
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,080
please don't go for a on-prem

1054
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,639
application and then deploy it and as

1055
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,158
your

1056
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,600
identity and access management doesn't

1057
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,880
require that there are very good

1058
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,439
products in the environment

1059
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,679
i mean in the market uh please choose to

1060
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,480
go with one of those it will definitely

1061
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,760
lead to reduction in operation costs um

1062
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,760
also start looking at

1063
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,679
whenever you're getting an identity

1064
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,320
management tool or an access management

1065
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,320
tool

1066
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,440
uh do check if it has threat analytics

1067
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,440
capability

1068
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,879
uh most of the tools today like let's

1069
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,119
say octa or let's say

1070
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,960
um you know uh sale point saving

1071
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,119
whatever we go ahead with right

1072
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,119
it has its own threat analytics module

1073
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,599
or let's say cyber arc or let's say

1074
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,879
uh any other tool it has its own threat

1075
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,800
analytics module

1076
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,799
so what basically happens is instead of

1077
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,399
sending all the locks to your sim tool

1078
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,919
or whatever is the new edr tool that is

1079
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,679
kind of coming into the picture

1080
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,918
and then processing it all in one place

1081
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,800
and making it one mammoth all over again

1082
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,399
you're just doing your intelligent work

1083
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,520
in each of the systems

1084
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,359
and then you're just sending the

1085
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,759
intelligent data to your sim tools

1086
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,119
that's

1087
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,119
definitely a preferred model of working

1088
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,079
that you're already paying the money for

1089
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,960
all these things

1090
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,800
so you want to pay as little as possible

1091
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,480
on the other end of the spectrum

1092
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,920
and there we have ultra mode

1093
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,359
capabilities that are kind of coming in

1094
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,240
right what can i do with our intelligent

1095
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,640
data

1096
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,560
so that's one of the key considerations

1097
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,240
mobile really technology

1098
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,759
mobile ready technology for identity

1099
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,598
management in terms of

1100
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,880
you know approving from your mobile and

1101
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,880
things like that not to your web

1102
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,240
application but just through an email

1103
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,160
or something like that it's been around

1104
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,078
for a very long time

1105
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,920
and many of the bigger organizations

1106
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,839
have definitely implemented it

1107
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,960
uh if you have not done it yet then it's

1108
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,680
definitely something that you should

1109
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,760
look into

1110
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,839
most products come with it too moving

1111
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,240
directory services to cloud

1112
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,119
99 of the organizations had active

1113
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,279
directory

1114
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,119
and 99 of the organizations are going to

1115
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,359
have as you're ready in the future

1116
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,320
the quicker you move there uh you know

1117
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,078
it's just

1118
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,440
easier for everyone as they move all of

1119
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:52,720
their uh legacy applications there too

1120
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,040
uh implementing uh yeah

1121
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,560
um many of the tools i mean at least the

1122
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,560
applications what i have noticed is some

1123
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,040
of the applications legacy applications

1124
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,320
they are

1125
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,079
kind of giant in size and when they

1126
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,000
do their projects they are able to move

1127
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,640
it only piece by piece

1128
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
so when we go through the projects with

1129
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,319
them and i go back to what

1130
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,079
tanya was saying in the morning morning

1131
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,280
just because we have moved our tools to

1132
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,800
the cloud

1133
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,320
does not mean that we we don't

1134
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,079
accommodate some of their needs we want

1135
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,200
to look at what their needs are

1136
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,720
in terms of and any id management or any

1137
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,720
access management solution on cloud

1138
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,200
should still cater to something on-prem

1139
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,240
there is always going to be one piece of

1140
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,839
applications

1141
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,078
that's going to of application that's

1142
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,599
going to lie on-prem it could be a crown

1143
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,960
jar as well it could be something that

1144
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,560
has pii in it

1145
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,400
or for whatever regulatory reason it

1146
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,160
simply cannot move into cloud

1147
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,000
whatever solution you create or

1148
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,680
architect should also be able to

1149
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,280
cater to something that's on-prem if

1150
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,919
only minimally

1151
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,760
passwordless authentication the most

1152
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,680
important thing moving to password-less

1153
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,520
authentication

1154
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,000
it the number of passwords we have right

1155
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,920
i mean

1156
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,520
on a day-to-day basis you're sitting in

1157
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,119
front of your laptop

1158
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,480
there's a pop-up do you want to register

1159
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,960
for this do you want to register for

1160
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,880
that

1161
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,119
there are hundreds of passwords every

1162
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,839
time i want to log into any of the

1163
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,200
sites i have signed into the first thing

1164
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,960
i'll be doing is clicking the

1165
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,480
forgot password link because i'm

1166
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,800
obviously not going to remember it so i

1167
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,480
get

1168
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,640
forgot password and then i send a link

1169
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,160
to my email box and then i kind of reset

1170
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,720
and then come back

1171
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,240
i think we should start moving more uh

1172
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,598
towards a passwordless uh

1173
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,799
authentication stream i i go back to my

1174
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,240
very first slide you know there are

1175
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,440
probably so many system administrators

1176
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,319
who will thank you to you know

1177
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,920
in the b2e and b2b uh environment and

1178
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,440
finally we have mfa

1179
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,200
uh adaptive authentication we have

1180
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,200
spoken so much about it today

1181
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,720
uh risk-based authentication what can we

1182
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,319
do about it there are so many ways of

1183
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,200
doing adaptive authentication

1184
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,119
uh smart devices uh or let us say you

1185
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,118
know um i mean we just spoke about it

1186
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,240
uh smart devices google authenticators

1187
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,119
use all of them

1188
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,359
go for uh you know an adaptive um i mean

1189
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,880
a

1190
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,560
more forward way of performing

1191
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,880
authentication

1192
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,000
and some very basic things like you know

1193
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,640
make sure the applications you're

1194
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,400
selecting what

1195
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,598
in terms of when you're floating in rfp

1196
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,320
and you're giving questions for what

1197
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,839
should be the

1198
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,040
security requirements ask basic

1199
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,799
questions like does the application

1200
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,560
support saml oh idc

1201
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,640
or you know does it do all of those

1202
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,160
things or um

1203
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,598
some of your software report so that we

1204
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,399
can see what it looks like and you know

1205
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,240
we can understand

1206
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,160
how well your product will scale or you

1207
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,839
know how much we can trust you

1208
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,598
so all these basic questions should

1209
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:30,799
obviously go in place

1210
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,160
then we have ueba uh it has been around

1211
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,320
for a very very long time

1212
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,440
but gaining a lot of importance and also

1213
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,760
the same time

1214
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,359
um user behavior analytics is kind of

1215
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,280
becoming a part of

1216
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,520
identity and access management solutions

1217
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,240
and also your siem solutions

1218
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,520
so you might want to consider all these

1219
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,598
things when you're selecting your

1220
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,119
technology

1221
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,200
a few other things that are very

1222
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,480
specific to organizations

1223
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,560
internally not necessarily uh

1224
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,240
uh you know the not necessarily product

1225
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,359
based but for what you will do as an

1226
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,359
organization

1227
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,279
most organizations still don't have a

1228
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,680
list of permitted applications

1229
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,280
what is allowed what can a person access

1230
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,960
when he is doing his work

1231
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,560
you need to have that central list of

1232
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,160
applications because as you

1233
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,759
go towards more internet phasing

1234
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,078
applications or you're letting people

1235
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,000
work from home on their laptops official

1236
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,720
laptops or it could be their own laptops

1237
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,480
too right

1238
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,040
what can they access what can they not

1239
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,920
access you want to know those things

1240
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,759
it is very important um then in terms of

1241
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,960
non-authoritative ids and distributed

1242
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,000
passwords right

1243
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,680
uh you need to have a central

1244
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,119
having that one trusted id you know it

1245
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,720
kind of goes back to that

1246
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,240
you want to have one id like the one

1247
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,118
ring that kind of controls everything

1248
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,919
else right

1249
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,359
and you don't want to be having or if

1250
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,960
there is some reason why you cannot

1251
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,160
avoid having those different ids in

1252
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,640
those applications

1253
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,279
how do you track it back to this id so

1254
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,440
you can

1255
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,280
terminate these accesses when required

1256
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,000
you can modify these accesses properly

1257
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,520
when required

1258
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,119
there's a change in email how does that

1259
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,319
email change flow into

1260
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,000
the rest of the um you know applications

1261
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,839
you want to think about all those things

1262
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,520
when you're re-architecting as you do

1263
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,720
your work from home

1264
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,280
these things were important in the

1265
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:17,359
corporate network but they are

1266
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:20,319
really you know in very subtle ways

1267
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:21,759
they are extremely important now role

1268
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,440
mining capabilities

1269
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,520
most identity management products

1270
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,160
provide role mining capabilities they

1271
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,160
provide it

1272
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,680
bottom up they don't provide a top down

1273
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,680
they provided bottom up

1274
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,759
but it is important to have both the top

1275
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,118
down and the bottom up way of doing role

1276
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,440
mining

1277
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,160
so please leverage this you know your

1278
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,200
organization

1279
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,879
best so develop your uh your uh

1280
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,319
what your role structure should look

1281
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,480
like you know based on the applications

1282
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:49,839
you have in your organization

1283
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:53,680
and the next point is on entitlement

1284
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,680
data management oh hellwinder hi

1285
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,280
give me one minute and i'm kind of done

1286
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,440
uh

1287
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,640
in terms of entitlement uh data

1288
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,200
management right

1289
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,000
you want to build an entitlement catalog

1290
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,919
many times

1291
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,359
the security team is kind of expected to

1292
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,560
take care of

1293
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,359
the entitlement data let us always

1294
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,279
remember that

1295
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:15,200
the security team does not we can only

1296
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,960
do governance we can only go back and we

1297
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,359
can provide the provisions we can tell

1298
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,440
them

1299
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:21,359
this is how i want to do uh governance

1300
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,160
but you cannot do it for the application

1301
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,880
team so

1302
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,399
please move all that function back to

1303
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,920
the application teams

1304
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,119
uh it's going to be more important as

1305
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,640
you start looking at what functional

1306
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,200
access can be provided what needs to be

1307
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,799
removed

1308
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,319
i'm sure that many application owners

1309
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,680
are going to come back and say

1310
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,920
these accesses should have never been

1311
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,200
provisioned so please remove it

1312
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,359
most access governance tools

1313
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,118
recertification tools allow for dynamic

1314
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,400
attribute based recertification so

1315
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,280
that's one of the considerations when

1316
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,359
you're going for

1317
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,599
product selection uh provisioning

1318
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:51,839
capabilities to uh

1319
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,599
privileged access tools it's a very

1320
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,119
basic feature basically

1321
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,800
and segregation of duties is something

1322
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,040
that kind of comes

1323
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,079
in the end mostly because it takes a lot

1324
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,560
of discussion

1325
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,920
it's obviously not something very work

1326
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,200
from home related

1327
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,720
but it's kind of an end goal that we

1328
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,000
should have in our mind as you are

1329
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,040
building our identity and access

1330
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,040
management environment

1331
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,480
these are some of the other things as i

1332
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,200
said

1333
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,560
iem is not siloed anymore so you might

1334
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,160
want to start looking at how is it going

1335
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,279
to interact or what kind of data is it

1336
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,520
going to provide to

1337
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,800
the casb siem and how is it going to

1338
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,280
interact with your other

1339
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,640
tools you have in your environment and

1340
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,800
most importantly

1341
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,279
make it easy for your application teams

1342
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:39,040
to onboard their applications

1343
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,480
once you get the uh flow of it right

1344
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,480
you're going to be asking the same

1345
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,000
questions for both access management and

1346
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,240
identity management

1347
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,920
from your application teams except if it

1348
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,078
is too complicated some finance

1349
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,760
applications are always very complicated

1350
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,760
and you might want to have a project for

1351
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,640
it but many smaller applications don't

1352
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,800
need it

1353
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,640
so set up a framework so that they can

1354
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,079
start onboarding and this will kind of

1355
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,920
accelerate whatever you're doing

1356
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:04,319
in terms of building a much better

1357
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,119
identity management environment

1358
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,920
this is more or less what i had uh thank

1359
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,520
you so much

1360
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,839
three minutes over time i'm really very

1361
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,839
sorry but thank you so much

1362
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,440
sorry harvinder i can't hear you but uh

1363
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,439
yeah

1364
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,560
thanks uh i forget

1365
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,920
first of all that's uh an awesome

1366
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,759
presentation

1367
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:36,079
um but uh we have one question from adam

1368
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,000
here's where do you see the crossover

1369
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,550
into physical access control with

1370
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,960
iam sorry

1371
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:46,560
[Music]

1372
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:49,760
where do you see crossover into physical

1373
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,759
access control

1374
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:58,319
okay call access control

1375
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,319
uh

1376
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,240
i would look at it in two ways okay i

1377
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,040
kind of focused on now b2e today

1378
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,640
completely

1379
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,079
and i was not necessarily thinking about

1380
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,839
all aspects of identity in terms of

1381
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,880
physical access but

1382
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:15,040
uh when we start looking at um

1383
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,400
i'll give an example what we went

1384
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,520
through it's probably a much easier way

1385
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,240
of explaining

1386
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,920
um when we are let's say let's say we're

1387
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,200
bringing in someone and i'll again go

1388
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,160
back to the termination use case because

1389
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,598
that is where you know most of the

1390
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,598
problems happen right

1391
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,119
so when you're kind of letting go of

1392
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,880
someone

1393
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:35,440
even today as far as i have seen um

1394
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,160
in spite of you know the tools from 2007

1395
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,160
saying

1396
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,520
oh identity management tools can give

1397
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,598
you access i mean can

1398
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,880
provide you the functionalities to

1399
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,839
remove physical access

1400
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,760
say you know we can just send a message

1401
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:51,040
or a task to the physical access board

1402
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,480
and you know they will remove access of

1403
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,119
that person based on that

1404
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,000
i still see today that most people rely

1405
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,520
on the hr

1406
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,599
communicating it to the identity

1407
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,160
management team hr communicating to the

1408
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,560
uh

1409
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,399
um you know the physical access team hr

1410
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,560
communicating to so many other people

1411
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,839
i think that's one primary area where

1412
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,078
you know we will

1413
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,599
we can make it much simpler i would say

1414
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,200
if we did go with the

1415
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:18,720
centralized id kind of uh model in the

1416
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:21,759
long run okay thank you very much

1417
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,720
uh for the session uh we're gonna take

1418
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,040
five minute break

1419
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,000
after that doctor nam need god properly

1420
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,440
gonna talk about

1421
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,200
artificial intelligence and machine

1422
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,240
learning in cyber security

1423
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:38,319
um thank you very much uh

1424
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:38,319
really appreciate it for your talk
