for any reason you

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,800
can't see the things that i am trying to

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,800
show you do my slides look okay

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,720
i'm gonna assume that's a yes

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:21,439
okay so this talk is called

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,519
security learns to sprint and it is all

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,320
about devsecops

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,880
things are changing and industry is

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,880
changing

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,799
and that means us security folks are

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,879
changing and so

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,280
this talk's going to explain what is

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,000
devops what is devsecops

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,640
things we can do so that we are going

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,640
along

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,280
with all the nice devops teams and

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,960
people and processes

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,480
but still make sure that there's secure

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,160
software at the end

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,239
let's do this okay so i'm tanya janka

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,440
and the purpose of the about me slide

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,640
i'm not sure if you knew this

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,239
it's to show you that we are qualified

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,079
to give our own talk i know it sounds

26
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,279
really silly but i didn't understand

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,480
like why are they telling me their

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,840
resume

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,000
i remember thinking like the audience

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,680
doesn't care what i do for a living and

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,720
they're like actually they do so

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,000
um i founded my own startup company

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,798
which is really exciting we're

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,720
called we hack purple and we train

35
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,439
people how to create secure software

36
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,798
and how to be appsec engineers and i'm

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,279
so excited

38
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,119
um i'm known as she hacks purple and yes

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,080
some of my hair is purple

40
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,119

my first book

47
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,158

and it ships october 27th and i'm so

49

seems good let's keep watching

65
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,599
yes let's begin the talk

66
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,480
okay so we are going to talk today about

67
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,640
how security

68
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,920
is part of everybody's job it's

69
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,720
literally

70
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,200
part of everybody's job for people that

71
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,200
write code it's your job

72
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,480
to write the most secure code that you

73
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,440
know how to write

74
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,959
if you are designing applications or

75
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,519
networks

76
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,800
it's your job to design the most secure

77
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,040
design you can

78
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,640
if you are performing operations and

79
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,239
supporting things it's your job to

80
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,319
harden all those systems

81
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,640
and protect them as best you can and so

82
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,119
security is a part of everyone's job

83
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,279
and usually i like to ask everyone so

84
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,360
you know who supports apps who works

85
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,440
in i.t who does this who does that who

86
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,319
does security and then i make everyone

87
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,280
put up their hand

88
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,958
but since it's virtual i hope you

89
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,599
realize that security is a part of your

90
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,360
job

91
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,720
whether it's in your job description or

92
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,400
not

93
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,080
we're also going to talk about what

94
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,519
devops is and

95
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,159
how we do it um and we're going to talk

96
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,840
about security becoming a part of devops

97
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:28,720
which makes for devsec ops yes

98
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,840
that's the best kind okay so let's start

99
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,560
with devops

100
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,720
um okay so this is the most famous

101
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,000
security slide about devops by pete

102
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,319
schedlock

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,599
so he's awesome he may have been being

104
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,679
sarcastic

105
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,640
but you can see the security person

106
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,720
cleaning up

107
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:50,238
uh the mess left by the amazing

108
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,359
unicorn pony pegasus of devops

109
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,720
and a lot of security people used to see

110
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,319
devops like this however this is how i

111
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,599
see devops so my friend

112
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,000
francois renault from devsecond made

113
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,200
this

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,280
and i love it and so

115
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,839
this is us teaching the magical devops

116
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,040
people

117
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,200
this is us giving tools and training and

118
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,320
assistance and enabling

119
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,680
the devops teams to do their job

120
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,519
securely to create

121
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,880
systems that are secure this is the way

122
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,919
i view devops and

123
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,120
i'm not kidding i i really think this

124
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,440
but that's what we're going to talk

125
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,840
about today these things

126
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,360
and more kind of hands-on stuff that we

127
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,719
can do

128
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,800
but i'm going to start with a couple

129
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,800
definitions this cloud is this

130
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,320
the slide is so loud that yellow is

131
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,600
really intense

132
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,000
we should make a poll in hopkins that's

133
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,840
like

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,560
is the yellow too intense should tonya

135
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,440
remove the yellow from the slide

136
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,199
um i just added it it was orange and i

137
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,520
felt the orange wasn't loud enough

138
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,520
anyway okay so i'm going to define a few

139
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,039
things for you

140
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,599
i know that some of you are probably

141
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,120
thinking oh i already know this stuff

142
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
but just remember there's people in the

143
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,400
audience who don't know this stuff and

144
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,280
that i'm defining it for them

145
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,880
so please have patience for two minutes

146
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,638
of definitions

147
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,320
so the first definition is what is

148
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,039
application security

149
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,320
and why does tanya keep saying absec

150
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,479
it's because i say

151
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,680
application security 100 times a day

152
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,840
when i teach

153
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,880
and it's just too long so appsec

154
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,799
is every and any activity

155
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,880
that you perform to try to ensure your

156
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,320
software is secure

157
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,479
so that could mean it could mean

158
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,360
literally anything it could be a formal

159
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,440
program

160
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,600
so an application security program to

161
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,880
turn your system development life cycle

162
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,639
into a secure

163
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,919
system development life cycle it could

164
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,800
be you

165
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,280
hiring a penetration tester to come in

166
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,600
and do

167
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,599
some tests or an expert to come and

168
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,720
review your code and do a static code

169
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,000
analysis

170
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,600
of all of your your stuff or it could be

171
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,199
that one of your software developers

172
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,400
heard a podcast and

173
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,400
it turns out you know one of the

174
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,599
third-party frameworks that they're

175
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,679
using

176
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,680
has a problem in it and they want to

177
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,240
upgrade off of that version

178
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,039
to make sure you know that they're not

179
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,720
insecure

180
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,240
and so they do that and you don't even

181
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,080
have to have the security team involved

182
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,520
to be fighting the good fight which is

183
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,560
to try to secure software

184
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,479
application security is a problem

185
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,800
um according to the verizon breach

186
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,240
report it causes

187
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,080
the most data breaches every year

188
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,560
um i've only been checking this

189
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,359
specifically since 2016 but they did a

190
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,880
halfway through

191
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,039
2020 report and unfortunately we won

192
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,000
that honor of being first again and if

193
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,639
you look at this chart

194
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,400
point of sales is the second one and

195
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,639
point of sales is when people skim

196
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,239
credit cards and so that's a physical

197
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,400
attack but if you look at the rest of

198
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,680
the online attacks

199
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,599
um it's actually still we're just

200
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,800
winning by such a landslide and i want

201
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,800
us to lose this

202
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,000
uh competition i want us to not be the

203
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,599
number one cause

204
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,199
and i don't want that to be because

205
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,440
other things get worse i want to be

206
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,080
because we get better

207
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,199
um also security's just it's not being

208
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,758
taught in schools

209
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,759
like in universities they might cover

210
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,400
web app hacking a little bit

211
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,800
but it is very very rare that they cover

212
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,000
application security as a whole

213
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,840
and that they teach it thoroughly um

214
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,440
you couldn't imagine someone going to

215
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,119
trade school and learning

216
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,639
to become electrician and having them

217
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,479
just not

218
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,199
teach them how to ensure what they're

219
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,280
doing is

220
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,400
safe and just having houses burned down

221
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,239
all the time and

222
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,239
saying well it doesn't happen that often

223
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,599
oh well because that's what we're doing

224
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,039
in computer science and software

225
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,120
engineering and it's just

226
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,479
it's so not acceptable this is actually

227
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,080
why i wrote the book

228
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,000
because i'm trying to adopt it into a

229
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,000
course for universities so

230
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,120
if you work at a university please reach

231
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,360
out because

232
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,800
i want this to not i want this slide i

233
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,160
want to delete it because it's not true

234
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,960
anymore

235
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,520
okay so security is outnumbered you see

236
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,758
her

237
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,840
that's me every place where i did

238
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,039
abstech full-time it's usually just me

239
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,359
there's like no team

240
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,960
helping me or maybe there's like one or

241
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,560
two people and they are running an

242
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,159
automated scanner

243
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,919
but i am the person that actually knows

244
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,840
all the app tech and doing everything

245
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,639
and look how lonely she looks in the

246
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,159
data center

247
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:33,440
cold and alone um that's the closest

248
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,479
photo i could get to like one of me

249
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,120
so dev's tech hops so there

250
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,839
are approximately they say an industry

251
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,360
100 developers for every 10 operations

252
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,160
people for every one

253
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,080
security person but that's every type of

254
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,000
security that's not appsack

255
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,279
usually i've worked and there's two

256
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,160
three 400 developers and me

257
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,279
one place i worked there were 4 000

258
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,319
developers

259
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,000
and me this was so hard

260
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,959
because they all wanted help and they

261
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,640
all needed help they like their requests

262
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,199
were genuine

263
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,920
um i had them writing me on linkedin and

264
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,240
twitter

265
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,760
to try to talk to me because i just

266
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,480
couldn't answer my emails i would just

267
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,519
like scroll

268
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,000
off the screen constantly and you can't

269
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,160
work

270
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,680
harder at that point you just have to

271
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,640
work smarter and

272
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,239
so my friend made this image for me

273
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,080
because the waterfall method of

274
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,480
developing software

275
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,760
really stinks it's good for physical

276
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,320
things because you can't keep

277
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,519
releasing new new versions of a physical

278
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,920
item you can't release

279
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,440
release a new version of a building but

280
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,199
for software

281
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,200
waterfall didn't work well and the

282
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,519
accompanying image

283
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,800
did not work well either and i remember

284
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,480
working somewhere and they had a very

285
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,359
long release cycle and it's very

286
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,240
stressed out and i was calling waterfall

287
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,320
water fail and my friend made me this

288
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,800
image he's like look it's dinosaurs all

289
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,279
happy

290
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,279
frolicking in the waterfall no

291
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,640
okay so what is devsecops that's what

292
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,600
you're thinking you're like that's what

293
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,839
i came to hear tonya

294
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,160
okay so i asked this question to my

295
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,200
friend imran mohammed and he

296
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,040
is the founder of practical devsecops

297
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,880
and they might be my company's

298
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,680
competitors but we're besties and i

299
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,800
don't care

300
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,800
he's awesome and so

301
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,560
he told me he's like it's what we've

302
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,959
always done tanya

303
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,560
we keep doing appsec but we work in a

304
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,959
devops environment

305
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,000
so we just change the way our do we do

306
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,199
our jobs

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,880
you know we don't want to break their

308
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,839
processes if they're sprinting we're

309
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,760
sprinting

310
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,360
if they're using a pipeline we want some

311
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,360
time in that pipeline

312
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,760
he's like we still have the same goals

313
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,079
we just get to them in a different way

314
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,160
and that is devsecops it's what we as

315
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,640
application security professionals do

316
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,160
in a devops environment and i was like

317
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,160
you're a brilliant dude we should be

318
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,920
friends

319
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,959
true story um okay so the three ways of

320
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,880
devops

321
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,319
so again you might know this but a bunch

322
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,000
of the audience doesn't know and that's

323
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,160
why i'm telling them

324
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,519
so there are three ways of devops things

325
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,800
that you must do

326
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,560
in order to be doing devops so the first

327
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,719
is

328
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,319
you must emphasize the efficiency of the

329
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,680
entire system

330
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,160
so we want to go fast but not just our

331
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,040
part

332
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,800
so sometimes this means rolling up your

333
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,120
sleeves and fixing bugs

334
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,959
security bugs with software developers

335
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,120
sometimes this means

336
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,119
breaking our activities into smaller

337
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,800
pieces there's all sorts of ways but we

338
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,240
need to increase the efficiency of the

339
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,959
entire system

340
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,279
not just our part the second way of

341
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,359
devops is fast feedback

342
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,880
and i just put fast feedback but it's

343
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,360
really fast

344
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,000
accurate feedback to the person who

345
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,240
actually

346
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,760
needs it and so there's no point in

347
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,000
getting really fast feedback

348
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,959
into a system and a dashboard that no

349
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,480
one checks

350
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,719
there's no point in getting really fast

351
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,200
feedback that's super inaccurate

352
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,720
so we're going to talk about that and

353
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,040
continuous learning

354
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,720
this means taking time to improve your

355
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,639
daily work

356
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,680
this means risk taking safe experiments

357
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,079
it means exerting effort to make sure

358
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,079
that our security results are better

359
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,120
faster more amazing and learning new

360
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,199
things

361
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,440
so these are the three ways of devops so

362
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,399
if you buy a pipeline you're doing part

363
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:34,079
of devops but there's so much more

364
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,959
okay so let's look at each of the goals

365
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,880
of devops so there's business goals it

366
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,638
turns out that just because all of us

367
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,160
nerds with hands-on keyboards

368
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,480
want to do devops does not mean the

369
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,800
business is okay with doing devops they

370
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,920
agree to do devops because of the three

371
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,079
main goals

372
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,479
that are achieved by devops so the first

373
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:56,479
one is employed

374
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,760
is improved deployment frequency

375
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,240
so they said you know we want to be able

376
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,200
to

377
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,519
release you know cool new features or

378
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,800
fix

379
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,200
things faster and so when i saw this i

380
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,079
thought

381
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,959
oh so you can fix my emergency security

382
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,160
right

383
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,880
now this is awesome so i liked

384
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,519
this when i heard it and then the next

385
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,880
goal

386
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,399
of devops is lower failure rates when i

387
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,439
saw this i was like oh i love

388
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,959
this so people in devops will say yeah

389
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,160
resiliency we want to make

390
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,199
really rugged apps and i i love that

391
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,279
because of this

392
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,560
the cia triad confidentiality integrity

393
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,680
and

394
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:43,040
availability that's right folks

395
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,638
the devops people love one of the cia

396
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,160
triad just like we do

397
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,000
and so when we look at this and they

398
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,279
talk about resiliency what i see

399
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,199
is the a in the cia means my apps are

400
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,880
always available so that means that they

401
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,639
are working really hard

402
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,120
one of their main goals is to serve one

403
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,800
of my main goals so i think devops is

404
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,720
awesome

405
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,880
and the last main goal that devops teams

406
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,560
have is faster time to market

407
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,360
and i know that some security people

408
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,319
might think how does that relate to us

409
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,600
we don't have jobs if we're out of

410
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,000
business

411
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,880
i have worked with many security folk

412
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,160
where they forget

413
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,920
it's our job to enable everyone else in

414
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,040
the business to do their jobs

415
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,199
securely and it is my firm belief that

416
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,680
the security team cannot win

417
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,839
if the business is not also winning i

418
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,638
mean if there's a bad marketing campaign

419
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,839
that flops

420
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,320
obviously that's not our fault however

421
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,199
we're not winning if the business is not

422
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,320
also winning

423
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,880
and so faster time to market is a giant

424
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,639
win

425
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,800
and faster time to market with a really

426
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:52,639
secure product is fantastic

427
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:56,560
and so i love devops i think devops is

428
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,480
awesome and so i'm quoting myself again

429
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,000
because no one else would say this for

430
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,160
me so i had to quote myself

431
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,680
so devops is the best thing to happen to

432
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,079
application security

433
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,839
since osp and since i'm an oas project

434
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,719
leader and chapter leader

435
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,079
clearly i love this community and so

436
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,320
that is the biggest compliment

437
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,239
i could possibly pay to anyone in the

438
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,959
application security field

439
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,399
and so i think devops is awesome and i

440
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,079
hope that by the end of this talk

441
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,120
you do too okay so now i want to go over

442
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,680
the three ways

443
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,880
again yes that's right it turns out if

444
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,959
you are going to learn

445
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,920
something that's brand new and abstract

446
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,319
and

447
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,680
complex that you need to repeat it three

448
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:41,199
times so this is time number two

449
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:44,319
so the three ways of devops are

450
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:47,519
emphasize the speed of the entire system

451
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,440
not just your part fast feedback

452
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,360
that is accurate and gets to the right

453
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,720
person or people

454
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:58,160
and continuous learning experimentation

455
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,399
taking time to improve your daily work

456
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,439
so let's figure out for the rest of the

457
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:06,639
talk actionable items that we can do

458
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,160
that supports each of the three ways yes

459
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,560
that is literally what the rest of the

460
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,839
talk is about except for the last two

461
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,479
minutes where i'm just gonna give you a

462
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,560
whole bunch of resources

463
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,680
okay so emphasize the speed of the

464
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,319
entire system

465
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,239
left to right that's us obviously i had

466
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,480
to make an amazing diagram for you

467
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,440
right this is the system development

468
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,440
life cycle

469
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,040
even if you're doing devops you still

470
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,759
need a list of requirements of what

471
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,599
you're building

472
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,120
you still need to actually design and

473
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,440
plan out what you're going to

474
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,639
build you still need to code that's the

475
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,680
fun part

476
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,519
we still test and then we release and

477
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,519
release and release and release

478
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,560
and so we want to add security to all of

479
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,079
these

480
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,560
okay what does this mean for dab and ops

481
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,839
it means we need their help tuning our

482
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,479
tools

483
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,160
because we don't want to be giving bad

484
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,839
quality feedback

485
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,839
doesn't matter if it's fast if it's

486
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,439
totally inaccurate

487
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:08,720
we want them to reuse known good

488
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,400
code so if we've tested something really

489
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,079
thoroughly in one app

490
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,559
maybe they could reuse that code in

491
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,520
another app ah

492
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,399
we want them to always use up-to-date

493
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,359
images

494
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,199
always always always always always

495
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,399
always

496
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,160
um if we create an asynchronous security

497
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,960
pipeline which i will explain in a

498
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,919
little bit

499
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,640
we need them to use it we need their

500
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,280
help

501
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,520
to make negative unit tests and again

502
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,000
i'm going to explain what that is

503
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,240
and we need them to adopt the mantra

504
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,880
that a severe security bug

505
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,160
breaks the build every time because

506
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,640
security

507
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,120
is a part of quality and you cannot have

508
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,039
a high quality piece of software

509
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,918
that someone like me can hack into in

510
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:59,200
five minutes that's not high quality

511
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,559
so this is the first of seven photo

512
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,400
slides

513
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,639
so i call this the photo slide because

514
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,480
you might want to take a screenshot

515
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,240
and so there's going to be seven of

516
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,720
these and this is the first

517
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,160
one and i know i went over this really

518
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,160
quickly but because it's b

519
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:19,039
sides i know that i am with a security

520
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,039
a security knowledgeable audience and

521
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,879
therefore i'm going to dive deeper

522
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,559
and more in depth to all the things that

523
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,120
are the responsibility of the security

524
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,840
team

525
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,959
rather than the dev and ops team i'm

526
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,080
going to quickly just slip

527
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,679
out of this so that i can make sure

528
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,600
that there are no comments from the

529
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,280
organizer team because i can't see their

530
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,959
comments in hop-in

531
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,480
and then i'm going to start this again

532
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,039
in one second because i just want to

533
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,480
make sure everything's okay

534
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,799
everything looks good they're not trying

535
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,080
to reach me awesome and now i'm going to

536
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,679
go back

537
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:54,799
to the slideshow i just want to make

538
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,720
sure i'm on time doing a good job

539
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,559
okay so what else what does this mean

540
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,200
for the security team

541
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,879
so the main most important thing if you

542
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,120
take away only one single thing from

543
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,200
this talk is we can't make devnops wait

544
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,918
on us forever we just can't

545
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,679
that's not acceptable anymore we cannot

546
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,640
be the threat to availability

547
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,480
so no more us being the bottleneck so we

548
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,520
need to make processes that actually

549
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,280
work

550
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,960
and if we keep doing things and we keep

551
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,960
doing things and we are the bottleneck

552
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,080
either we need more staff or we need to

553
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,200
do things a different

554
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,600
way and it is so

555
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,640
important it is so important that we

556
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,120
adjust our mindset

557
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,919
we cannot just throw up a gate and stop

558
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,000
everything

559
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,760
no one's going to tolerate that from us

560
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,520
in a devops environment

561
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,679
and so if they are doing their work in

562
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,879
sprints we should break up our work into

563
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,000
sprints

564
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,240
we need to focus on we are

565
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,440
equal to their value stream we are not

566
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,240
more important

567
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,760
and so we have to work really hard with

568
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,679
them to make sure

569
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:02,240
that we are not a constant bottleneck

570
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,200
okay so what does this mean sometimes we

571
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,520
have to break up

572
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,080
our activities into smaller pieces if

573
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,679
they do their work in three-week sprints

574
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,600
we need to figure out how to fit some of

575
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,200
our work into a three-week sprint

576
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,719
there's lots of different ways we can do

577
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,960
that like if we're doing

578
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,000
a static application security testing

579
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,320
exercise

580
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,280
we can just test part of the app or we

581
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,678
test the whole thing

582
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,158
and validate the results all during one

583
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,000
sprint and then put all the results

584
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,240
into the bug tracker so it's ready for

585
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,480
the following sprint

586
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:37,520
um it means that basically

587
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,799
we need to get on board with them and we

588
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,879
need to make sure that we don't

589
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,158
so in devops they'll say pull the andon

590
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,360
cord which means

591
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,159
you know in an entire physical

592
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,678
manufacturing line stopping the line for

593
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,799
everyone in the whole

594
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:57,120
factory so we can't break the build

595
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,360
which is very similar to pulling the and

596
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,600
on cord unless it's a true emergency

597
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,918
so this is another very important thing

598
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,760
that we need to take home with us

599
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,960
and so yes there's a whole bunch of

600
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,480
things that we can do

601
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,480
so we need to tune our tools thoroughly

602
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,240
so that there are no false positives

603
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,799
that we are sending them so this might

604
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,480
mean

605
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,400
you know if you're using a sas tool then

606
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,480
you don't put it in the pipeline

607
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,919
you manually validate all the results

608
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,679
and then you put those results

609
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:30,799
into their bug tracker this might mean

610
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,360
that you use an i asked tool instead of

611
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,960
a sas

612
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,840
tool because although it finds less

613
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,440
results the results are more accurate

614
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,918
there's a lot of different things that

615
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,280
you can do um one thing that i've i've

616
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,280
seen that is super cool

617
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,879
is there's a team where and i can't tell

618
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,039
you where but they

619
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,080
run so they do continuous scanning of

620
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,760
everything

621
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,439
and they validate those results and then

622
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,559
they put it into an api

623
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,880
and so every build calls out to the api

624
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,000
and all it says is your most recent scan

625
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,600
was good or bad like you

626
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,159
failed or passed your most recent scan

627
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,080
so if they fail it breaks the build

628
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,200
and those bugs are already in their bug

629
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,399
tracker and

630
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,320
they already know which ones they have

631
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,320
to go fix and so

632
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,360
yes it's not scanning in the pipeline

633
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,879
it's asynchronous or it's out of band

634
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,879
however that's awesome so within like a

635
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,200
few hours the build is breaking

636
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,799
and this is good because it's immediate

637
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,840
feedback the fastest they could get it

638
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,158
to them

639
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,559
and so another thing we can do is we can

640
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,919
provide code samples that are secure or

641
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,158
we can test with them

642
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,120
and ensure that they provide them i like

643
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,880
to call it a secure coding library

644
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,320
so i'm a big fan of a secure coding

645
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:43,600
library and the idea of it is that

646
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,559
you work with the developers so you do

647
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,158
not run up

648
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,000
as a security person and then put your

649
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,400
hands in the code library

650
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,919
it is like a woman's purse i kid you not

651
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,880
you do not touch that without her

652
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,200
permission

653
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,880
so it is their code library it's not

654
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,880
ours so you talk with them

655
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,760
and elect one of them the secure coding

656
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,080
librarian and that person cares

657
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,480
for those code samples and helps to make

658
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,879
sure they actually get reused

659
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,760
and so this is an activity i've done

660
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,000
before and had

661
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,919
really good results with it saved a lot

662
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,039
of time and then we would just security

663
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,360
test our template

664
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,280
over and over again and then if

665
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,360
something new was found we would push it

666
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,200
out to all of our apps it was great

667
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,760
super that's what you do when you have

668
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,760
less money

669
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,120
for for your your dev budget okay so

670
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,039
another thing is

671
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,399
so i talked about this briefly so

672
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,520
sometimes it's called a security

673
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,440
pipeline

674
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,000
sometimes it's called an asynchronous

675
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,640
pipeline or parallel pipeline

676
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,400
but when we in devops talk about the

677
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,039
pipeline or app pipeline

678
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,840
almost everyone is actually meaning to

679
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,039
say

680
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,439
a release pipeline so it releases to the

681
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,720
dev

682
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,880
environment the qa the uat staging

683
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,640
and then it releases to the prod

684
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,799
environment however

685
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,480
you don't have to release the prod and

686
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,600
you don't have to have one pipeline so

687
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,120
you can actually

688
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,719
i remember doing a demo once and i had

689
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,918
four pipelines that would all run at the

690
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,600
same time because obviously

691
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,200
who doesn't want more of a good thing

692
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,120
and so one of them

693
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,480
would create all the infrastructure and

694
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,639
the other one was putting stuff

695
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,080
on and then one was just like torturing

696
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,880
it with tests

697
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,279
and so you can make a security pipeline

698
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,000
or an

699
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,480
asynchronous or parallel pipeline that

700
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,600
does

701
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,000
all of your long tests and it kicks off

702
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,879
only let's say when a major revision

703
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,840
happens so

704
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,840
you know we're at 4.1 and we go to 4.2

705
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,520
and then that triggers it to run and all

706
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,559
your slow tests run

707
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,720
and then it doesn't break a build it

708
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,720
doesn't stop people from releasing

709
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,440
it just gives us all those automated

710
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,120
tests and then a security person goes in

711
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,679
validates them and puts that into the

712
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,439
bug tracker this is beautiful because

713
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,960
it's still automatically running your

714
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,360
test for you

715
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,520
and it's not slowing anyone else down

716
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,439
you're working within their processes

717
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,879
and then you are getting them results

718
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,440
just later

719
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,279
and then just put your super secret very

720
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,159
important types of tests

721
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,320
really critical into the actual release

722
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,039
pipeline so i scan for secrets in a

723
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,120
pipeline

724
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,400
every time if something looks like it a

725
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,799
secret

726
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,720
break the build and i like to scan for

727
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,799
software composition analysis because

728
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,760
it's a really fast check

729
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,320
and i want to know if you put a new

730
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,200
plug-in

731
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,720
and that's dangerous um the one last

732
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,679
thing that i'm going to say

733
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,440
on this slide is that buy licenses for

734
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,480
these tools if you expect them to be in

735
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,440
the pipeline

736
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,880
if you expect them to go and pay for

737
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,760
those you might not

738
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,360
get happy news okay what else does this

739
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,080
mean for security

740
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,279
this does not mean doing 100 of the work

741
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,678
yourself

742
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,240
it means making it possible for dev and

743
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,159
ops to perform security as part of their

744
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,760
daily work

745
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,360
sometimes it means writing your own

746
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,520
tools

747
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,039
netflix is really well known for writing

748
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,840
tools and then open sourcing them and

749
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,440
sharing them with

750
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,600
the industry and community which i

751
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,840
thought was really cool

752
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,158
but you don't have to write your own

753
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,760
tools necessarily it's when one doesn't

754
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,600
already exist that does the thing that

755
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,360
you really need

756
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,918
the point of the slide is to enable

757
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,240
devon ops every single way

758
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,400
that you can see how she's using a phone

759
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,200
and a computer she's using two devices

760
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,679
to enable

761
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,159
the dev and ops people that's probably

762
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:36,240
not what she was doing but that's okay

763
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:38,000
so um please take a screenshot of this

764
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,760
slide if you are planning on doing

765
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,080
it and please be creative

766
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,158
when you are helping them in any way you

767
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,000
can and remember

768
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,320
that you need to emphasize the speed of

769
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,760
the entire system so if you are adding

770
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,240
in stuff

771
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,080
that is slowing other groups down you

772
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,840
need to figure out how you can do better

773
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,199
for them and do the best that you can

774
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,720
for them this doesn't mean you're never

775
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,840
allowed to slow anyone down ever it

776
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,080
means you need to

777
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,678
do make sure you do that the least often

778
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,520
as possible

779
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:13,039
fast feedback so this is right to left

780
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,840
but i like to think of this as

781
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,440
pushing security left or shifting left

782
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,158
starting security earlier i want

783
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,080
security in

784
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,080
every phase of the system development

785
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,600
life cycle but don't believe me

786
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,240
believe the ponemon institute so

787
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,600
they did some research on this and they

788
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,760
saw that basically

789
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,799
uh what software developers have known

790
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,279
forever

791
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,080
the later you fix a security or any type

792
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,840
of bug

793
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:42,240
or flaw so a design flaw

794
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,158
is something in the design and a bug is

795
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,960
something in the implementation

796
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,159
and it is exponentially more expensive

797
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,840
to fix things later

798
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,520
and this doesn't include if you have a

799
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,120
security incident or a data breach

800
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,158
because that number would be

801
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,600
through the roof so it is really really

802
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,760
important

803
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,439
that we do these things as fast as

804
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,039
possible so what does this mean for

805
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,039
devon ops

806
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,799
means providing feedback to the security

807
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,879
team we need their feedback

808
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,720
they are literally the key stakeholders

809
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,640
in this so we need to know

810
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,000
hear from them and then we need to

811
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,399
actually listen and take action

812
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,760
and if we have security activities we

813
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,678
need them to participate

814
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,919
these are the main things that we need

815
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,919
from devon ops and it's

816
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,279
we really need those things we need

817
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,679
buy-in

818
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,840
we need buy-in that's what we need okay

819
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,840
so

820
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,360
other things that this means for us the

821
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,679
security team

822
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,360
um so we need to provide feedback

823
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,679
earlier so we

824
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,120
cannot just hire a pen tester to come in

825
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,720
at the very end

826
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,959
right um that is a thing that

827
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,080
i used to be a pen tester and i would be

828
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,320
invited at the end

829
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,039
and then as soon as i started consulting

830
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,399
and got to control some of this stuff

831
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,840
i started showing up earlier way earlier

832
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,439
and saying like let me wait for the

833
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,520
design with you can i do this with you

834
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,799
and that with you and i would give them

835
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,120
like a report then and then they would

836
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,480
fix

837
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,239
all those things and then i would come

838
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,720
in at the end and then like

839
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,159
really you know do a lot of stuff but

840
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,760
the point is is that

841
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,679
then that there would be way less things

842
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,480
at the end their app would be way more

843
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,720
secure

844
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,880
because they can't fix all the things

845
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,320
that i find you know two days before

846
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,640
they release

847
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,240
so this is very important this is the

848
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,799
number one thing

849
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:35,360
in way two give them feedback sooner

850
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,639
oh and it also means no more false

851
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,719
positives

852
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,799
you cannot deliver results from an

853
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,159
automated tool directly to

854
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,720
those teams unless you've tuned that

855
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,720
tool

856
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,240
and especially if you've validated those

857
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,399
results

858
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,360
it's really important okay so what else

859
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,639
does this mean

860
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:57,120
we need to listen to feedback so if they

861
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,559
tell us like oh your new tool is awful

862
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,399
we need to listen because guess what

863
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,520
developers and ops folks are really

864
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,760
really smart

865
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,279
and you know what they'll do they'll

866
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,600
turn it off

867
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,279
that's right folks they'll just turn off

868
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,639
all the security tests because they know

869
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,720
how to do that

870
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,720
and they're adults and they have crap to

871
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,320
do they have deadlines to meet and if

872
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,520
our tools are really not working they'll

873
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,559
just turn them off while we're not

874
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,639
looking

875
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,320
and so we need to ask them how it's

876
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,919
going and then we need to listen to

877
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,158
their feedback and then we need to

878
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,000
fix things that are not working for them

879
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,440
it's very very important

880
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,720
okay um if you want to hear a really

881
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,880
awesome story about

882
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,279
listening to feedback you should look up

883
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,440
netflix repo kid

884
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,640
they made something called repo man and

885
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,360
then they turned it into something

886
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,600
called repo

887
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,559
kid because of the feedback they got

888
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,120
from their teams they

889
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,600
listened and adjusted and came up with a

890
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,600
way better results

891
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,879
for everyone for the security team as

892
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,480
well

893
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,320
okay i'm gonna just check in with

894
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,320
organizers again

895
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,639
and there's nothing in the chat for me

896
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,320
so i guess everything's awesome and that

897
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,279
makes me happy

898
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,760
um if the presenters could put something

899
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,279
into

900
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,519
i'm going to assume i'm supposed to stop

901
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:14,159
at 10 15 or at quarter after the hour

902
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,039
if i have more time that's good to know

903
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,960
okay

904
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:22,559
so what does this mean for security

905
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,399
so everywhere people are making unit

906
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:27,200
tests

907
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:29,039
and actually let me let me hide this

908
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,519
because i know you're all reading it

909
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,480
so unit tests are tests that software

910
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,519
developers write

911
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,039
and they check it in with their code and

912
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,519
they test the smallest

913
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,120
possible units of code to make sure it

914
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,080
does what it's supposed to do

915
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,000
so unit tests are positive tests they

916
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,918
test the things you should do what

917
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,480
they're supposed to do

918
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,919
if stuff fails then they don't check

919
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,679
that code in

920
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,039
and they don't push it into the release

921
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,240
pipeline so this is

922
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,399
really far left negative unit tests

923
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,440
ensures that your application gracefully

924
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,600
fails

925
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,840
this is where we come in we want

926
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,480
negative unit tests so we can work with

927
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,559
our security champions if we have them

928
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,679
or we can work directly with all the

929
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:16,720
developers which will be a lot more work

930
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,720
and we can help make negative unit tests

931
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,600
that they check in alongside their code

932
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,919
and that they run

933
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,918
every single time before their code goes

934
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,760
anywhere into that pipeline

935
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,039
and so we can add tests for cross-site

936
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,279
scripting we can add

937
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,799
tests for injection all sorts of cool

938
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,480
stuff that gets run

939
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:36,158
automatically every time and you know

940
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,480
what this is this is regression testing

941
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,080
so every time a developer makes a new

942
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,679
change or adds a new feature

943
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,519
they run all of these tests to make sure

944
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,640
they didn't break any of the original

945
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,960
things

946
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,559
and if one of those tests fails they

947
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,559
know they have to fix something and this

948
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,158
means we get regression testing of

949
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,720
security and this is

950
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,080
awesome the first time i heard this my

951
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,440
friend morgan roman

952
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,080
gave this talk and i was like this

953
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,880
dude's awesome i have to be his friend

954
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,840
so amazing it is very good value for

955
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,799
your time

956
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,320
so other things we need to invite dev

957
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,039
and ops to participate in security

958
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,720
activities

959
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,080
so if there's a security incident first

960
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,600
of all we should be telling them what we

961
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,600
need from them

962
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,120
and we should be inviting them if it

963
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,000
involves their app

964
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,918
threat modeling dev and ops have the

965
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,440
most evil ideas of how they could hack

966
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,120
their apps you definitely want them in

967
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,080
threat modeling sessions

968
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,918
security sprints yes that's right if you

969
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,678
can figure out how to get the project

970
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,440
manager to add a sprint

971
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,000
that's a two or three week amount of

972
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,279
time in a project schedule

973
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
for security oh that is a beautiful

974
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,240
thing

975
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
we cannot just add a giant secure code

976
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,360
review in the middle of a project and

977
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,159
then expect them to still meet their

978
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,719
deadlines

979
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,360
we need time the project schedule yes

980
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,760
that's right

981
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,080
and then we need to make sure that dev

982
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,399
and ops know this is not a time to fix

983
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,120
other bugs and ignore the security team

984
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,479
we have to plan activities with them

985
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:05,439
okay so another thing this means

986
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,480
is so i am obsessed with metrics and

987
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,399
data

988
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,480
i always want to be the best and you

989
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,679
need to measure in order to know

990
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,280
that you're on the right track and

991
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,480
improve yourself and how can i be the

992
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,599
best if i'm not measuring

993
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,399
right and so i

994
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,800
like to put all of my results into some

995
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:25,440
sort of vulnerability management system

996
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,399
so there's a free one from oauth that is

997
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,040
open source called

998
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,759
defect dojo but then there's also paid

999
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,599
ones

1000
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,119
so there's one from the denim group and

1001
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,960
it's called thread fix

1002
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,240
and then there's i believe white source

1003
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,839
just started creating one

1004
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,199
i haven't seen it yet but i know their

1005
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,799
other software is awesome so it's

1006
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,279
probably also awesome

1007
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,679
but the point is is to put all of this

1008
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,240
information from all of your tools

1009
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,280
into the same place and look for

1010
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:53,439
patterns

1011
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,520
look for um like trends

1012
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,359
you can definitely do better if you can

1013
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,119
actually measure where you're at

1014
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,880
um and so you could do this in microsoft

1015
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,160
excel even if you want to but the point

1016
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,920
is is you need to

1017
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,279
use these metrics and then you want to

1018
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,440
share these metrics

1019
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,040
with dev and ops you want to tell them

1020
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,359
like listen

1021
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,400
we're seeing this from this team or

1022
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,240
we're seeing

1023
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,599
this type of result when this happens

1024
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,959
etc

1025
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:21,599
help them do better by sharing your data

1026
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,400
also you know if you're already making

1027
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,480
unit tests

1028
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,079
if you have a security assessment done

1029
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,640
or a pen test done

1030
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,480
a penetration test you can take those

1031
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,680
results and turn those into unit tests

1032
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,240
to make sure that those things don't

1033
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,399
come back

1034
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,078
and you can take those results and look

1035
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,160
at most of your other apps and you

1036
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,599
probably have those problems there too

1037
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,680
i used to work somewhere and we would

1038
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,400
only have enough money for one pen test

1039
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,160
a year

1040
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,760
and i would take those results and apply

1041
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,279
them everywhere because i wanted to get

1042
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,320
the most value i could

1043
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,599
out of that engagement and so now we are

1044
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,960
on photo slide

1045
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,280
number five and we are very close to the

1046
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,079
end

1047
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,920
because i think i have until 10 15 and

1048
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,920
then we will do questions after so

1049
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,359
please put questions in the chat for me

1050
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,839
because i love questions

1051
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,400
and if i don't have time to answer them

1052
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,599
you know

1053
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,280
while i'm doing my video

1054
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,920
and while i'm in my question period i'll

1055
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:19,119
just answer after in the chat it's cool

1056
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,839
let me know okay so

1057
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,640
next the third way of devops continuous

1058
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,960
learning

1059
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,118
i like to think of this as full circle

1060
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,800
so you need to allocate time to improve

1061
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,400
your daily work which means learning

1062
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,839
cool new things which means doing

1063
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,599
experiments and risk taking

1064
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,040
which means learning from those things

1065
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,240
which means improving your processes

1066
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,839
which means doing better

1067
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,799
and better and better and ends up being

1068
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:43,200
a circle of awesome

1069
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,880
um this also means creating rituals that

1070
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,919
reward

1071
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,040
these activities so if someone finished

1072
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,440
a university course part-time on their

1073
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,880
own

1074
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,040
i think you should tell the whole team

1075
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,839
like look at so and so alice is so

1076
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,720
awesome

1077
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,040
or bob's team had a pen test done and

1078
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,879
the

1079
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,079
person couldn't find any highs or

1080
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,040
criticals

1081
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,760
look at how awesome bob's team is i'm a

1082
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,000
big fan

1083
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,640
of positive reinforcement because i

1084
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,320
totally live for compliments

1085
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,960
okay so what does this mean for devon

1086
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,880
ops if we give them security training if

1087
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,400
we offer it we really need them to show

1088
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,160
up

1089
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,520
this means devon ops could actually

1090
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,279
train themselves

1091
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,440
um so i have had a lot of software

1092
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,400
developers that take my courses in

1093
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,400
training

1094
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,079
because their security team isn't

1095
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,760
supporting them the way they want and

1096
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,480
they want to be awesome and i'm like

1097
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,400
great you're

1098
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,280
all of you all of you are welcome come

1099
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,400
on down

1100
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,160
it means that they should share

1101
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,119
information widely when they fix a

1102
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,960
security issue

1103
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,680
because if that security issue is in one

1104
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,359
app it might be in a whole bunch of apps

1105
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,520
it means that if we are doing security

1106
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,000
simulations or exercises or other

1107
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,960
security

1108
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,920
activities we need them to follow and

1109
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,040
participate

1110
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,480
and it means that we need them to be on

1111
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,920
board for our policies

1112
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,640
so i like to gasp

1113
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,480
talk to other teams when i am going to

1114
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,480
create a policy

1115
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,240
yeah that's right i'll actually take a

1116
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,320
secure coding guideline and then go

1117
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,759
talk to all the developers and ask them

1118
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,839
their opinions and then change it

1119
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,040
based on feedback yeah that's right so

1120
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,560
then when it comes out

1121
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,400
most of the people have already seen it

1122
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,560
it's not a surprise

1123
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,240
um you might have remembered this in

1124
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,480
canadian politics

1125
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,759
when ryan mulrooney was in charge of the

1126
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,520
budget

1127
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,440
and he just kept sharing information

1128
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,880
about the budget for months leading up

1129
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,040
to when he presented the budget

1130
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,720
so the way they used to do it is they

1131
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,359
would just present the budget and then

1132
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,959
everyone

1133
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,400
ever all the parties would freak out and

1134
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,640
be pissed off all the

1135
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,160
different you know government

1136
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,000
departments everyone would always be

1137
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,520
pissed so what he did is he like went

1138
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,119
and got feedback from everyone and

1139
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,640
shared it and so when he presented it

1140
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,480
everyone had already seen it

1141
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,240
and so it was like our first budget ever

1142
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,359
that just got approved

1143
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:02,479
um and so i follow his lead and do that

1144
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,839
and it works really well trust me

1145
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,200
so what does this mean for the security

1146
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,000
team because that's what we want to

1147
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,598
learn about

1148
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,839
so we need to share information widely

1149
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,680
if there is a serious security incident

1150
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,480
once it is cleaned up

1151
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,160
if you have a lunch and learn and tell

1152
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,440
everyone what happened

1153
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,440
you better believe it you're going to

1154
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,480
get a bunch of software developers and

1155
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,760
operations people

1156
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,680
on board with you i did that somewhere

1157
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,000
where i used to work my manager shared

1158
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,839
all the

1159
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,040
information and i was dead set against

1160
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,720
it i was like we can't show

1161
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,160
our dirty laundry they'll know we're not

1162
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,359
perfect

1163
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,200
that's bad but i was wrong

1164
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:42,560
and he was ray and it was such a great

1165
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,879
idea and it got everyone on board also i

1166
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,119
believe that we should share our data

1167
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,160
so if i don't mean that we should share

1168
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,920
you know like a recipe of how to hack us

1169
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,279
but i think we should share you know we

1170
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,960
have lots of problems with cross-site

1171
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,520
scripting or it would appear that we

1172
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,560
have

1173
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:01,440
an organizational wide allergy to

1174
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,960
security headers and we need to talk

1175
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,720
because it helps

1176
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,160
it helps when you share share

1177
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,640
information that you can share

1178
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,520
and security is so good at keeping

1179
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,960
secrets

1180
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,240
and keeping things confidential we

1181
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,440
forget when we're supposed to share

1182
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,200
information and

1183
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,520
our industry is really not awesome at

1184
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,000
that and so please try to remember to

1185
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,720
share

1186
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,920
information that can help other teams it

1187
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,799
also means

1188
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,560
so i used to work at elections canada

1189
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,920
and i was the cso for

1190
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,640
the first time that we um elected

1191
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,839
trudeau and so that was in 2015. that

1192
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,359
was a lot of work

1193
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,279
um we weren't in the newspaper for

1194
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,799
security problems and that's all i can

1195
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,920
really tell you but obviously like

1196
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,440
that's pretty awesome

1197
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:47,440
um and so the elections canada

1198
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,200
for 100 years they run a fake election

1199
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,359
before every real election

1200
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,200
so they'll build out a returning office

1201
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,319
they build the network they install the

1202
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,160
apps they have

1203
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:58,240
people pretend to vote and then we do

1204
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,560
this for a day

1205
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,078
and we throw security incidents in and

1206
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,799
all sorts of problems

1207
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,079
and we test out all of our processes

1208
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,680
yeah that's right

1209
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,440
and you can find all sorts of

1210
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,520
interesting flaws

1211
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,119
and so we do that like six eight months

1212
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,720
before the election and then we

1213
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,560
fix everything and so then when the

1214
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,319
actual election happens you might notice

1215
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,599
that things tend to go well compared to

1216
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,160
a lot of other countries and that's

1217
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,280
because

1218
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,960
we practiced for the the well i was

1219
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,319
gonna say the big day but now

1220
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,520
there's many days when you can vote

1221
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,960
because they figured out that's what

1222
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,079
canadians want

1223
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,560
and so running a simulation

1224
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,160
is amazing and i used to work um you

1225
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,279
know for the government for a very long

1226
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,480
time they also

1227
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,800
run exercises security exercises so

1228
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,720
that is a few days where they have us

1229
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,440
manage incidents and practice

1230
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,040
and they're so creative it's super fun

1231
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,920
if you can ever get invited you should

1232
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,119
go

1233
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,119
and they have like fake news um like

1234
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,160
fake news casts like this happened to

1235
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,480
this and

1236
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,839
oh no and like they let you come up with

1237
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,560
threats they let you come up with

1238
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:06,400
defenses it was just it's so

1239
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:09,359
fun and so i learned so much and so

1240
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,359
security exercises and simulations those

1241
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,359
are a great way for you to find out your

1242
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:15,520
problems and fix them before the real

1243
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,279
thing happens and then when

1244
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,599
i actually had a security incident once

1245
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,599
that we solved in 14 minutes

1246
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,440
and that was because of training i was

1247
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,640
so impressed with my team

1248
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,319
i went up and i briefed the executives

1249
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,240
wrote them the media note and came back

1250
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,759
down in 14 minutes

1251
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,598
and i just walked around and just

1252
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,000
high-fived them and told them like you

1253
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,839
are

1254
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,599
the most amazing team i've ever worked

1255
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:40,799
with because

1256
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:43,599
that is fast wow okay

1257
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,319
so here's the book please take a photo

1258
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,680
slide

1259
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:50,160
um one of the things of experimentation

1260
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,720
that uh is a story i don't have time to

1261
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,960
tell but

1262
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,118
netflix made another open source tool

1263
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,200
called chaos monkey

1264
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,520
where essentially it was an experiment

1265
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,040
and gosh darn it worked

1266
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,800
and if you look in your favorite search

1267
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,040
engine for that story

1268
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,160
it's really good i'm friends with some

1269
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,720
of the people

1270
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,319
on the netflix uh absec team and i

1271
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,040
admire a lot of the work that they're

1272
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,720
doing

1273
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,560
and i admire even more how they're

1274
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,240
sharing this with the industry because

1275
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,319
they make movies yo

1276
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,839
they don't need to share this they're

1277
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,279
not like getting anything out of it

1278
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,880
they're just trying to make the world a

1279
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,000
more secure place and i

1280
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,359
really applaud that what else does this

1281
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,440
mean for security

1282
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:32,720
so the most important thing in

1283
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,440
continuous learning of all these things

1284
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,480
okay so one of the most important things

1285
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,680
is performing

1286
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,359
blameless postmortems we cannot say

1287
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,799
alice is the worst

1288
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:45,279
bob it's all his fault that breaks trust

1289
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,040
between

1290
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,280
teams and it actually doesn't help at

1291
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,920
all because it's not alice or bob's

1292
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,000
fault

1293
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,000
it's almost always a safeguard was

1294
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,440
missing a policy didn't work

1295
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,200
a process was broken when we fix those

1296
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,280
things we make sure these problems don't

1297
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,279
happen again oh was bob never given

1298
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,119
training on this tool he was expected to

1299
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,240
use every day

1300
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:10,880
maybe it was that oh was alice given

1301
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,479
5 000 things to do in a very short

1302
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,119
period of time so she could never

1303
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,319
possibly have done all of them

1304
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,319
maybe that was a problem and

1305
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:22,160
we need to in order to have a blameless

1306
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:24,319
postmortem it means we need to actually

1307
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,240
have a post-mortem event and talk about

1308
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,560
security incidents when they're over

1309
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,839
and do our best to make sure they never

1310
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,480
happen again

1311
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,279
and so you must hold a post-mortem event

1312
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,880
after every

1313
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,800
serious security incident it also means

1314
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,800
teaching developers and operations

1315
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,520
people what the output means

1316
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,839
from security tools you can't just send

1317
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,880
them

1318
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:48,960
the automated report from a sas tool

1319
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,359
and not validate it and not explain what

1320
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,839
it means and send them like a 1 000 page

1321
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:56,240
report full of potential bugs

1322
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:57,520
that's basically like giving them the

1323
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,240
middle finger

1324
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,880
it's not helpful it's very rude and so

1325
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,520
we need to

1326
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,079
teach them we need to also put all this

1327
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,680
information

1328
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,079
in a knowledge base to make sure that

1329
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,160
everyone has access to it

1330
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,680
i'm a huge fan of knowledge bases and of

1331
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,319
course obviously i have a story about

1332
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,919
that but

1333
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,839
i don't have time i'm also a fan of

1334
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,680
creating

1335
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:21,279
lessons about different opportunities so

1336
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,078
you can give the lessons at lunch you

1337
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,680
can write

1338
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,240
a white paper if you really feel like it

1339
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,160
wait papers are hard to write as an fyi

1340
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,000
you can create you know hire someone

1341
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,640
come in to do formal training you can

1342
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,280
have job shadowing but the first time i

1343
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,598
gave a presentation i was totally scared

1344
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,079
i was very very nervous and now i'm

1345
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:42,480
awesome at it and you'll probably never

1346
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,319
get to the point where you're totally

1347
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,839
excited to present for two or three

1348
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,960
thousand people in a room and that's

1349
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:49,680
okay

1350
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,359
but if you talk from the heart you

1351
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,118
explain to them what happened you share

1352
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,000
as much information as you are allowed

1353
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,880
to share

1354
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,359
i assure you they will care they will

1355
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,520
listen

1356
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:01,200
and they will act differently from then

1357
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,599
on so

1358
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,439
teach them what they need to know to do

1359
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,560
their jobs

1360
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,400
okay so this is the last of

1361
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,000
the picture slides and i just have a

1362
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,119
couple of brief things to say

1363
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,400
about culture change because if we want

1364
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,480
all these things to happen

1365
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,800
we need our culture to change so we are

1366
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,520
on board with devops you can't just buy

1367
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,040
a pipeline

1368
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,400
piece of software and then put one of

1369
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,040
your apps through it and say we're doing

1370
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,520
devops

1371
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,520
you must do all three ways or you are

1372
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,119
not doing all of devops

1373
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,880
and that means you're not getting all of

1374
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,440
the amazing benefits

1375
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,640
and trust me the benefits don't end

1376
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,440
they're awesome

1377
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,118
okay so security needs to become a part

1378
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,680
of devops

1379
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:46,400
so how do we do that culture change so

1380
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,839
celebrate when there is a win

1381
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,280
people only are used to seeing the

1382
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,078
security team when something bad

1383
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,440
happened

1384
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,400
i don't want them to be like oh no

1385
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,240
tanya's coming quick hide

1386
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,680
i don't want that i don't want them to

1387
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,759
see me and go oh

1388
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,078
what have i done i don't want that

1389
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,400
reaction i want to show up with

1390
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,920
donuts or a gluten-free alternative or

1391
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,280
fresh fruit or whatever the thing is

1392
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,119
that you do in your office

1393
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,640
and say this is a gift for you from the

1394
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,000
security team because you passed your

1395
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,480
pen test

1396
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,400
i want to go and give high fives when

1397
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,680
they get past my scanners

1398
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,280
i want to positively reinforce

1399
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,720
every single thing oh you made it

1400
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,240
through the security pipeline

1401
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,759
you're amazing i'm going to send an

1402
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,279
email and tell everyone how awesome you

1403
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,520
are

1404
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,200
i really really want positive

1405
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,559
reinforcement i've seen too many

1406
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,759
security teams that just slap

1407
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:37,359
hands all day long and that doesn't

1408
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,000
create the environment you want where

1409
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:41,119
people trust

1410
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,240
you and come talk to you i realize this

1411
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,720
slide is scary

1412
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,399
when i watch tv now if i see a person

1413
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,439
walk up to another person i'm like no

1414
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,960
call me they're not wearing a mask so

1415
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,720
you're probably thinking oh no they're

1416
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,640
so close

1417
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,640
but we really need to work more closely

1418
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,078
with dev and ops and by this i mean

1419
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,400
virtually

1420
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,920
because safety first but we really we

1421
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,440
need to spend time with them like show

1422
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,079
up to their meetings sometimes

1423
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,640
show them support help them if they're

1424
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,680
going to

1425
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,558
whiteboard a design join them

1426
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:14,240
right become their if you can become

1427
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,839
their friend that at least become their

1428
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,200
acquaintance

1429
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,880
it's really important they know your

1430
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,558
name if they don't know your name

1431
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,920
if none of the developers know your name

1432
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,559
and you work in appsec you're doing

1433
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,319
something wrong

1434
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,920
no more blaming yeah that's right i'm

1435
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,319
saying this twice because it's important

1436
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,480
and i

1437
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:32,720
actually made this mistake really badly

1438
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,720
once and it took me months to recover

1439
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,640
from it i totally

1440
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,919
i even raised my voice a little which i

1441
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,078
like never do

1442
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,440
and gave someone holy hell and it was

1443
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:43,040
not cool

1444
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,000
took a long time to rebuild that

1445
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:48,160
relationship and that trust

1446
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,599
i am a huge fan of security champions if

1447
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,040
you do not have a security champion

1448
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,599
program you should totally

1449
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,960
consider one they are essentially the

1450
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,000
most awesome humans

1451
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,839
on each of the teams and they champion

1452
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,599
your cause of security and you teach

1453
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:05,040
them and you enable them give them

1454
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,680
tools buy them cool books so many things

1455
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,480
and

1456
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,240
they just they help you get your mandate

1457
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,480
done

1458
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,319
so i have a call to action now and then

1459
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,800
i'm gonna give you the resources and i

1460
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,640
hope

1461
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,520
i guess i'm gonna go one or two minutes

1462
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:23,359
over time and i hope that's okay

1463
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:25,440
they can interrupt me if it's not but

1464
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,480
i want to do a call to action to you

1465
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,920
who's watching

1466
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,240
so you i mean you right there if you see

1467
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,680
me

1468
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,839
you're probably like oh she's not i'm

1469
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,440
talking to you

1470
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,880
i want to give you a call to action and

1471
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,960
i'm very serious about this

1472
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,920
it is security's job to enable dev and

1473
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,240
ops

1474
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,160
to do their jobs securely and so i want

1475
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:48,000
to raise your right hand

1476
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,640
i'm not kidding right i can see some of

1477
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,880
you

1478
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,200
raise your right hand no one has to see

1479
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:57,359
you seriously raise it up

1480
00:49:53,200 --> 00:50:00,000
i'm waiting for that last guy okay

1481
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:02,319
it is my job repeat after me it is my

1482
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,480
job

1483
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:06,480
to enable dev and ops

1484
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,480
to do their jobs

1485
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,839
securely

1486
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,000
thank you i read a study that if you

1487
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,800
make people promise to do something

1488
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,960
they're 80

1489
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,240
more likely to do it so i'm hoping that

1490
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,960
99 of you

1491
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:29,359
adopt this as a model it's our job to

1492
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,200
enable to teach to automate to give them

1493
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,240
feedback to do every single thing within

1494
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,040
our power

1495
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,558
for them to create secure software and

1496
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,520
secure systems

1497
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:42,160
and secure our data and so if we

1498
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:45,520
remember it's our job to enable them

1499
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:48,160
we can do better thank you

1500
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,680
thank you for going along with me i know

1501
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,839
that sometimes i'm a little

1502
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,480
much but thank you now for some

1503
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:57,200
resources

1504
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,079
first the open web application security

1505
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,359
