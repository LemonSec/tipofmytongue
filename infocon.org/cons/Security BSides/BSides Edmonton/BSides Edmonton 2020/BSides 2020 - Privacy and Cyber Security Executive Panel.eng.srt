uh well just over five years now and

68
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,920
since christmas time

69
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,599
and a more heavy focused move towards

70
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,079
digital services

71
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,760
i was also given the portfolio of

obviously as with digitized services

80
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,519
it's important for albertans to have

81
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,680
connectivity to those services

82
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,840

area

85
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,760

87
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,879

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,399
cyber security awareness and disaster

90
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,400
recovery

91
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,720

94
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,239
in the security industry since 1981 i've

95
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,559
had

96
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,400
the pleasure of working with a number of

97
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,920
folks that are on the screen here today

98
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,239

99
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,079
executive positions including ciso and

100
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,120

11 or 12 now i've been on and i think

this is the 13th and 14th team i've i've

104
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,920

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,359
wonderful thank you uh so this year's

108
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,720
theme is resilient cyber security post

109
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,120
2020

110
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,319
as we know cyber breaches are on the

111
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,159
rise

112
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,159
this is this is important because

113
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,519
technology is a vital component of most

114
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,120
organizations

115
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,360
and as a result of the pandemic

116
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,680
organizations have transitioned

117
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,799
to working from home at an unprecedented

118
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,480
pace

119
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:07,439
this has led to many new lessons

120
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,238
many new surprises and it's sort of led

121
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,000
to

122
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:15,200
an experiment at an unprecedented scale

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,079
um i wanted to share a few

124
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,560
numbers cyber cyber breach numbers just

125
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,160
to kind of

126
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,560
get our juices going before i start

127
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,440
asking a couple of the questions that i

128
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,080
have

129
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,680
so so here goes 8 billion records have

130
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,159
been exposed in the first quarter of

131
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,560
2020

132
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,680
there has been a four-fold increase in

133
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,440
cyber crime since

134
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:41,440
march 1st of this year as reported by

135
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,440
the fbi in april of this year

136
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,719
and so this this is a little bit dated i

137
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,680
don't know what the numbers would be at

138
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,160
this point

139
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,120
um cyber security global spending is

140
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,240
projected to increase to 137

141
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,840
billion dollars by 2022

142
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,280
cyber crime economy is estimated at six

143
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,719
trillion dollars by 2021 which is just

144
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,000
around the corner

145
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,199
this would place cyber crime as the g-10

146
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,080
country

147
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,080
if that gives a little bit of scale and

148
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,599
and finally and there's some good news

149
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,560
in this because the numbers keep coming

150
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,039
down

151
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,479
the time for detecting the average time

152
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,240
to detecting a cyber

153
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,719
compromise is at 56 days at this point

154
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,840
so i wanted to kind of just level set us

155
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,000
to some of the

156
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,039
the challenges the opportunities and the

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,520
improvements

158
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,240
that we're seeing and and my first

159
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,560
question

160
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,840
to each of you uh following your

161
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,120
introductions

162
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,000
is how have your roles expanded

163
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,360
over over the past few years and has

164
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,639
this pandemic further

165
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,639
altered your role

166
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,400
so um maybe i'll switch it up this time

167
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,280
i'll start tim

168
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,880
with you you're gonna do that because my

169
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,520
neighbor is cutting his grass so this is

170
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,520
perfect right

171
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,199
no i mean so the numbers he gave hannie

172
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,758
were pretty frightening it's

173
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,479
it's scary to see how we are our world

174
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,800
is changing

175
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,919
and more so now because of covet 19 and

176
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,919
some of the i think it's

177
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,758
forced transformation that we're having

178
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,520
to do with our workforce

179
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,520
part of it what i'm seeing at least from

180
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,680
my perspective is this idea that

181
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,880
we're now the changes that i'm seeing is

182
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,360
we're i

183
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,600
i'm relying now on 5800 users doing the

184
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,720
right thing at home

185
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,600
i'm just going to let that hang there

186
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,840
for a couple minutes um

187
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,080
what i would love to see i mean in my

188
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,919
utopia is that we would have

189
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,919
everybody knows the computer hygiene you

190
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,960
should have at work should bring home

191
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,758
but i don't know if that's going to be

192
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,440
the case

193
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,800
i think you're right though what i'd

194
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,319
love to see is some of the statistics

195
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,120
are going to come out in the end of this

196
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,560
year

197
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,639
right now that we've had more people

198
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,240
staying from home i know that this was a

199
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,000
change for a lot of organizations

200
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,560
particularly those who weren't typically

201
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,400
used to having a large workforce at home

202
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,840
the same problems though are going to

203
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,120
occur from home right we're still going

204
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,479
to see the ransomware on the malware

205
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,199
we're still going to see attacks against

206
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,479
the endpoints

207
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,000
we're still going to see people who are

208
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,359
really interested in the data that all

209
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,479
of our organizations hold

210
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,400
and they're going to do as much as they

211
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,719
can as often as they can now

212
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,039
to try to get that data from us the

213
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,199
concern then becomes is how do i train

214
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,280
a workforce that may not have been used

215
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,280
to be remotely working from home

216
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,400
in an environment that with my neighbor

217
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,840
cutting his grass we weren't

218
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,359
particularly ready for

219
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,679
as we get in our work from home

220
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,280
scenarios so how do i reduce the risk

221
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,360
how do i reduce the threat factors that

222
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,119
are facing people working from home

223
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,800
as they would be working from your

224
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,319
office we're using

225
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,080
different service providers now for

226
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,840
wi-fi and connectivity

227
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,440
we're using different locations now as

228
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,799
opposed to our typical desks

229
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,800
we're sitting in bedrooms now and

230
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,840
kitchen tables you know i've seen people

231
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,440
propped up on their

232
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,039
lucky fellows popped up on their

233
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,400
balconies to do their work

234
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,560
this has changed right and this has

235
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,080
changed the paradigm of how we function

236
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,080
and this is going to be become that new

237
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,800
normal so this is i'm looking for what

238
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,400
the next

239
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,160
three months brings what's the next six

240
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,440
months the next year brings that's

241
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,319
that's where i'm really worried about us

242
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:04,160
those next next few months

243
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:06,080
thank you kim martin uh yes actually uh

244
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,479
the covet pandemic this year

245
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,719
has acted as a catalyst not only for us

246
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,878
but also for attackers obviously

247
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,879
the scary part in the numbers that

248
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,599
you've given is they don't even include

249
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,759
some other

250
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,719
types of crime usually they don't

251
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,479
include things like

252
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,080
nation states trying to actually bring

253
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,120
government systems down through

254
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,198
denial of service attack this is

255
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,879
one type of attack that we've been under

256
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,400
since the beginning of the pandemic here

257
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,880
at the government of alberta

258
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,718
and only increasing day-to-day different

259
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,799
types different vectors are being used

260
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,200
different ways to try to attack

261
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,880
our systems sometimes trying to attack

262
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,479
from within through a phishing attack

263
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,599
that might be successful or something

264
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,080
like this and we have to

265
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,959
constantly be on our guard and evolve

266
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,880
our protection

267
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,560
and show that our staff are well trained

268
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,240
and know how to respond to it

269
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,160
and ensure that our management and our

270
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,920
executives are actually aware of what's

271
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,040
going on so that we don't have to ask

272
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,120
for permission

273
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,040
before doing things like shutting down a

274
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,200
system or something like that

275
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,199
most of you a lot of people anyway i

276
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,880
know ended up not being able during a

277
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,080
period of time and as you know you were

278
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,480
able to sign up

279
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,279
through madi as a matter of fact to get

280
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,920
some money

281
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,080
uh to actually help you get through the

282
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,599
period where you were not working

283
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,600
you should have seen the attacks coming

284
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,200
on this on these systems most of them

285
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,560
from russia and i'm not saying it was

286
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,399
russians

287
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,920
as we all know attackers like to

288
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,080
actually redirect their attacks to

289
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,760
actually blame other parties

290
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,120
but it's been going on since the

291
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,040
beginning of the pandemic

292
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,160
now for us just put it in perspective

293
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,719
actually we

294
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,199
have about 35 000 employees and

295
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,000
contractors at the government of alberta

296
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,519
and one week into the pandemic once we

297
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,399
decided that we were going to work

298
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,640
remotely

299
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,640
we were essentially being asked to

300
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,199
provide services that would enable those

301
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,160
35 000 people to work remotely working

302
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,160
from home

303
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,600
and we managed to actually do that just

304
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,319
in a few weeks

305
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,320
just the thought of doing that maybe two

306
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,839
months before the pandemic occurred

307
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,680
most of us would have looked at it and

308
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,560
said that's impossible it's not gonna

309
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,479
happen

310
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,760
the payment system that i've mentioned

311
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,920
to you earlier

312
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,839
uh if we had been told you got three

313
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,479
days there were the systems we would

314
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,800
have gone

315
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,600
there's no way even if we work overtime

316
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,839
guess what it happened within three days

317
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,880
and that's the new normal we're now at

318
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,440
the point where

319
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,399
we have to deliver services faster but i

320
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,720
will say

321
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,920
the new environment as risky as it is as

322
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,880
we're working from home

323
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,519
now has enabled people to actually have

324
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,240
a life

325
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,040
while also having a work life it's weird

326
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,959
to say but

327
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,959
i do the same i work from home sometimes

328
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,959
i'll start my laundry in the morning

329
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,000
now come online i'll do some work you

330
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,518
want to make sure you keep your

331
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,360
information secure you want to make sure

332
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,959
you don't go print stuff that is

333
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,320
confidential that other people in the

334
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,199
house could see you want to make sure of

335
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,360
all those things

336
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,959
but you also have that flexibility now

337
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,560
working from home and what we're finding

338
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,359
is our people are working later

339
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,880
longer hours harder are more focused on

340
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,959
their work and next thing you know as we

341
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,880
deliver faster so there's both some good

342
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,560
and some bad to the environment we're in

343
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,439
i think we have to recognize that

344
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,279
we have to adapt to it and my job as

345
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,079
chief information security officer is

346
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,160
obviously to

347
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,519
keep that secure environment there to

348
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,000
ensure that people are

349
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,920
aware well trained have the right tools

350
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,519
to ensure that the information can be

351
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,719
shared in a secured manner

352
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,800
thank you rachel so

353
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,240
when you talked about the stats uh hani

354
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,240
the first thing i thought about was

355
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,079
um what something that i find is often

356
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,160
missing uh when we talk about

357
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,120
um breach stats especially in this in

358
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,040
this kind of

359
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,800
environment and that's human error and i

360
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,040
would say when when

361
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,079
we talk about breaches as a result of

362
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,760
the pandemic

363
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,120
the majority of the ones we've seen are

364
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,640
actually due to human error and it's

365
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,600
because people were rushing to get home

366
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,519
and people were

367
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,720
um you know grabbing documents they

368
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,920
probably shouldn't have had and left

369
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,200
them in their car and their car was

370
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,760
broken into and

371
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,560
um and or um they you know somebody

372
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,959
wasn't in a

373
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,160
um an office for a period of time so

374
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,599
they didn't know that a breach had

375
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,880
happened because nobody was

376
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,959
was uh um checking in on on that uh

377
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,120
in that office for a period of time so

378
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,000
um we do definitely see some uh human

379
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,880
error

380
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,320
along those lines what's different in my

381
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,880
environment from

382
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,720
tim's and martens is that our role is

383
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,360
guided by legislation

384
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,800
so i don't get to be agile i have to

385
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,600
follow what the law says

386
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,279
and i have to continue to try and um uh

387
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,639
regulate within that even in times of

388
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,680
pandemic so what's been really

389
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,760
challenging

390
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,839
um for the commissioner i would say is

391
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,399
that in a time of pandemic

392
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,240
how do we continue to work within the

393
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,959
confines of the law when the law doesn't

394
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,519
have

395
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,119
um an exception for a pandemic so we

396
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,480
have things like access requests that

397
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,240
have 30 days to respond to

398
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,240
and that i would say that the um the

399
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,120
provincial government did manage that

400
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,480
but we have a lot of other issues there

401
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,160
more than just time that

402
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,839
where we're asking for documentation

403
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,439
we're trying to conduct investigations

404
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,120
we have timelines that are legislated

405
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,920
for our investigations

406
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,360
and um we uh um and suddenly we can't

407
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,719
meet face to face with people we're

408
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,240
trying to interview and

409
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,079
um so we've had a lot of challenges

410
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,480
because we can't we're just not agile

411
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,239
we're

412
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,519
we're stuck within the constraints of

413
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,560
the law

414
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,560
um so i think my my uh uh

415
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,599
my perspective on this is one of feeling

416
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,359
really constrained

417
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,600
a lot and that we want to be a little

418
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,000
bit more agile and adaptable

419
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,639
and uh we're doing the best we can but

420
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,920
um

421
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,680
we still have to work within what the

422
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,800
law says and it does make things a

423
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,800
little bit more difficult for us

424
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,440
thank you so so follow on to that seeing

425
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,040
that we've had this increase in

426
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,160
digitization and

427
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,760
and business services going online

428
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,040
um the question really is has privacy or

429
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,600
cyber security

430
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,319
taken a more prominent role in

431
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,160
technology

432
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:55,720
projects um i'll switch it up

433
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,719
martin i'll go to you sure

434
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,920
absolutely and it's it was i'll be

435
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,399
honest

436
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,880
it's not caused by covet it's been

437
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,199
accelerated by cobit

438
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,959
the need for privacy for security being

439
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,359
involved from the beginning at the

440
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,359
idea stage of digitizing a service or

441
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,600
something like that was always there

442
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,440
but i think cove it and the acceleration

443
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,240
of the delivery of those solutions is

444
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,720
making it

445
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,519
absolutely absolutely integral we don't

446
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,440
have time

447
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,199
to think about security after fact and

448
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,959
then go back to passion application

449
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,599
system to make it secure or something

450
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,680
like that

451
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,079
we don't have time to deal with privacy

452
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,519
issues once we go live that would be

453
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,239
silly to do it this way

454
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,560
so as a result to fast track the

455
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,279
implementation of solutions we're seeing

456
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,000
privacy our privacy officers are

457
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,320
involved in

458
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,160
all projects from the idea stage when

459
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,680
people start talking about data sets

460
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,560
that we're gonna put online and where

461
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,079
they're gonna be

462
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,239
especially if they're gonna go to the

463
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,719
cloud which is kind of the option number

464
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,720
one

465
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,040
right now for most solutions that we put

466
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,800
in place security is the same way

467
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,120
the first thing we do is we do what we

468
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,399
call a statement of sensitivity for any

469
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,560
idea that we have about moving a a new

470
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,440
data set to the cloud or even on-prem as

471
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,680
a matter of fact

472
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,839
we assess the classification of the data

473
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,040
from an information security perspective

474
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,800
and then we kind of

475
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,240
identify what the risks are how we're

476
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,359
going to mitigate them

477
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,880
and as usual all the time we always put

478
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,720
all this information in front of the

479
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,760
business and the business has to make

480
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,360
the decision

481
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,519
how much risk are they willing to live

482
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,880
with and how fast do they want to move

483
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,279
and so on and so forth

484
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,240
so absolutely it's like the first thing

485
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,839
we do in

486
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,519
any design and development process

487
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,120
at this point in time is involve

488
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,720
security and privacy

489
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,480
to ensure that we're not going to cause

490
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,160
any issues to the government of alberta

491
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,320
or to albertans of course to all of our

492
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,000
stakeholders

493
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,920
wonderful and rachel what's your

494
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,839
perspective

495
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,439
so i have to say that i expected that we

496
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,480
would see a lot more breaches related to

497
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,959
covet and

498
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,759
we are tracking breaches that um are

499
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,479
submitted to

500
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,440
our office um under any piece of

501
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,519
legislation where

502
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,480
where the organization says that this is

503
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,480
as a result of the

504
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,320
of cobit or the pandemic and we're

505
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,600
seeing a lot less than what i expected

506
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,360
maybe that's because they're not being

507
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,519
reported to us just yet or

508
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,959
you know that's always it's always in

509
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,680
the back of my mind or

510
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,479
um uh maybe the the reality is is that

511
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,079
we're just not

512
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,519
we're um there's just not gonna be as

513
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,000
many as we expected we thought there'd

514
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,360
be a big

515
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,120
surge and there just wasn't um enabling

516
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,800
people to work from home very quickly

517
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,600
um just for me seems fraught with issues

518
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,959
one of the things that we've seen a huge

519
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,519
uptake in our office

520
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,479
is um virtual care platforms and in the

521
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,320
health sector

522
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,000
so this is um and you i'm sure you've

523
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,199
seen some of this um in the news and i

524
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,839
won't speak about any of them

525
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,160
specifically um but we do have at least

526
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,279
one that we're investigating

527
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,639
currently um but uh these are where um

528
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,320
you can meet with your healthcare

529
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,759
practitioner online just as we're

530
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,320
meeting today really

531
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,480
and we we have since the pandemic we

532
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,240
have between 80 and 100 privacy impact

533
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,160
assessments so since march

534
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,520
we've had between 80 and 100 privacy

535
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,439
impact assessments submitted to our

536
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,319
office just on virtual care platforms

537
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,360
alone

538
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,918
so um so the uptake is really fast and

539
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,839
um

540
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,439
have we reviewed all of those no we have

541
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,559
not yet we're currently looking at a

542
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,000
plan to be able to do that as

543
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,678
efficiently as possible

544
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,760
because we are in a pandemic and the

545
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,360
majority of these um

546
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,799
those who have submitted them are health

547
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,479
practitioners they they have other

548
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,359
priorities right now so we want to try

549
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,520
and find an

550
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,280
efficient way to do that so the way in

551
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,160
which we've looked at this has been

552
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,600
quite a um

553
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,280
it's been quite a switch in this the

554
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,159
types of services

555
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,440
or or um platforms that um organizations

556
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,360
are looking to implement

557
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,480
um and they are there and what's great

558
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,080
is that we're getting a lot of

559
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,080
information about them and we're getting

560
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,918
a lot of them submitted to us so

561
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,678
um i do think there's there's uh some

562
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,120
good news in there

563
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,520
uh for sure thank you and tim

564
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,280
your perspective on this please so from

565
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,480
a security and privacy perspective what

566
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,039
i've been seeing this

567
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,720
little while and martin and rachel both

568
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,360
alluded to it is that we've been

569
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,919
seeing the requirements to bring in

570
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,320
cyber

571
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,120
and privacy professionals and projects

572
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,120
at the onset

573
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,320
right and where it's this whole idea and

574
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,639
i think you learned about it a little

575
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,879
bit today about this idea of push left

576
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,080
right get everything as as close as you

577
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,919
can to that you know

578
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,360
time when i walk out of a restaurant

579
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,440
with a napkin and a pen and i have a

580
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,399
great idea stop right bring in privacy

581
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,320
and security and let's start

582
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,600
understanding what the implications are

583
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,520
what are the different threat factors

584
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,120
how critical is the information so

585
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,720
this whole approach that we've been

586
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,159
adopting within the city of calgary is

587
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,360
based on the principles of enterprise

588
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,360
security risk management

589
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,719
this idea that it's the business that

590
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,399
makes the decision because they're the

591
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,039
ones who set the goals and objectives

592
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,640
so our role as security professionals in

593
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,640
concert with our privacy

594
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,840
team members our privacy professionals

595
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,120
who are part you know a different

596
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,760
department within the city but we work

597
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,159
with them

598
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,879
on projects throughout the year we've

599
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,120
been now

600
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,000
bringing both lenses to a project we're

601
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,239
incorporating

602
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,360
our approach from an esrm based uh you

603
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,280
know framework

604
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,559
and we're using digital transformation

605
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,080
to take that data and put it in a

606
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,600
repository so now i can start

607
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,000
presenting risk back to the business in

608
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,480
a very objective way it's

609
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,760
kobe's made it faster to martin's point

610
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,280
earlier we're uh

611
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,039
we had to speed things up right we

612
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,039
really had to get across

613
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,960
a couple of hurdles internally and now

614
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,240
that we have our approach now is

615
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,559
really keeping moving forward on the

616
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,000
same methodology looking at things from

617
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,559
business lens and understanding what are

618
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,120
the risks

619
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,639
and then applying or bringing in privacy

620
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,760
professionals as we need to

621
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,880
you know from a privacy impact

622
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,160
assessment on all these different

623
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,440
applications so

624
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,840
it's changing the way we're doing our

625
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,360
business it's forced us to be more agile

626
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,678
it's forced us to think

627
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,439
more as a business professional than a

628
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,880
pure security professional who says no

629
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,400
we lost that right a long time ago to

630
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,679
say no to projects now it's

631
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,559
how can we help reduce the risk as

632
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,080
opposed to how can i stop the project

633
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,080
you are so right if you don't mind me

634
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,879
adding something you are so right tim

635
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,280
actually this is

636
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,200
this is key in the past people saw

637
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,039
security professionals as the person who

638
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,480
always says no one you ask them to do

639
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,559
something that's no longer an

640
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,559
option for us it's all about risk it's

641
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,399
about okay you want to do this

642
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,240
here's the risk are you willing to live

643
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,760
with it and here's what i can do to

644
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,880
potentially mitigate it

645
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,320
but it's no longer a no thing it never

646
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,120
will be again i think

647
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,639
no agreed and in terms of involvement

648
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,080
it's kind of funny because like i i kind

649
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,600
of read the question listen to you and

650
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,840
we talked about projects

651
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,719
one of the reason why this is happening

652
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,240
at this moment

653
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,000
why we're putting so much of the focus

654
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,600
is also that our executives

655
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,400
the people at the highest level of the

656
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,959
organization know about security a lot

657
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,320
more than they used to they are informed

658
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,280
they see what's going on in other

659
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,120
organizations

660
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,120
i'm actually going to mention this here

661
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,879
because i think that's important

662
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,239
when there was a switch in government

663
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,120
two years ago from

664
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,120
ndp to ucp there was a transition team

665
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,360
that had been put together and literally

666
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,158
one week after the uh

667
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,240
the election was over i was brought in

668
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,080
personally to do a presentation on cyber

669
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,320
security to the transition team

670
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,439
this is how important it's becoming to

671
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,080
organizations

672
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,080
nowadays it's no longer cyber security

673
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,320
is that side thing that this geek in the

674
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,520
corner in a dark room with a desk and a

675
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,039
pen and you know

676
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:15,520
it takes care of it's not i was thinking

677
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,158
about you tim although uh yeah it does

678
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,158
fit doesn't it

679
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,039
but it truly has become a major focus

680
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,320
for the executives of

681
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:28,158
every organization it is and i agree

682
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,039
with them i think there's a point where

683
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,480
now we're being asked to provide context

684
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,360
to business so they can make a better

685
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,039
decision

686
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,520
and that's that's a role we haven't

687
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,120
played up until probably about you know

688
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,879
not that long ago through maybe three

689
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,399
four at most five years

690
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,240
but now that we're being brought to that

691
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,919
table now it's on us as security

692
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,000
professionals to start making those

693
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,679
business presentations as opposed to

694
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,320
those truly technical presentations and

695
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,240
that's

696
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,840
that's where our next change has to be

697
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,480
in the profession is now how do i focus

698
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,320
on risk

699
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,159
how do i focus on business how do i make

700
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,520
sure that we bring in privacy so that

701
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,440
all of the aspects that we need to cover

702
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,960
from the data that we're responsible for

703
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,799
that we're able to protect it and then

704
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,960
how do i as a security professional walk

705
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,200
away from it if the business decides

706
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,240
against something i recommend how do you

707
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,280
do that

708
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,679
right i mean thank you these are all

709
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,559
excellent perspectives and and i i fully

710
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,720
agree so

711
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,879
so if i was to sort of surmise them in

712
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,200
some sort of a call to action

713
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,880
it would be to ensure that we're very

714
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,559
tightly stitched integrated with the

715
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,320
business so that we're having

716
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,840
business value and business risk

717
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,120
conversations

718
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,439
that we are regularly um

719
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,719
you know performing very efficient and

720
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,200
very effective

721
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,960
assessments privacy impact assessments

722
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,440
threat risk assessments

723
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,720
and providing pragmatic guidance or

724
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,200
pragmatic

725
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:51,520
direction to to the asset owners or the

726
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,600
business executives that are responsible

727
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,799
for these business services

728
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,000
that um we've ensured that security and

729
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,799
privacy

730
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,679
are embedded at the very beginning of

731
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,240
our initiatives

732
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,799
and and i know i know tanya talked about

733
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,960
software

734
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,000
development life cycle now with secure

735
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,559
software development life

736
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,720
cycle as well as you know the the

737
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,120
security team is now not a

738
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,880
the security office or the privacy

739
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,600
office is not the privacy office

740
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,400
but there is it's it's all of your users

741
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,600
it's a team

742
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,600
sport everyone has a responsibility

743
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,399
although their responsibilities

744
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,080
vary but everyone has a responsibility

745
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,400
and we probably need to do

746
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,360
a really good job of making sure that we

747
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,200
improve

748
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,360
their knowledge of what they need to do

749
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,080
so so maybe what i would ask is

750
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,520
with all of this in mind pandemic or no

751
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,199
pandemic we know

752
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,440
we're we're moving in the right

753
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,919
direction and honestly after 30 years

754
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,960
i'm

755
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:52,240
very happy to see this continued trend

756
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,559
my question is have have you or your

757
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,400
teams had to acquire new skills

758
00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:01,918
or new tools to be able to move forward

759
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,520
and so just to keep it changing i think

760
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,960
and i'm going to lose probably track of

761
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,240
who i asked last but

762
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,080
rachel um i'll start with you sure

763
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,520
um so can i just say first of all i

764
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,639
think it's really sad that it took a

765
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,559
pandemic to get

766
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,279
you know privacy regularly at the table

767
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,200
but um regardless of how we got there

768
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,200
i'm very excited to hear what you're

769
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,960
saying is that privacy is there now

770
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,400
because for a long time we've really

771
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,000
felt the same way as security and we

772
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,320
felt like we've been fighting to get

773
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,279
to get um at the table early on so i

774
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,399
think that's that's

775
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,000
um that's fantastic news um from an

776
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,880
outsider looking in and hearing what

777
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,880
you're saying

778
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,400
so i would have to say that the way in

779
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,200
which my team

780
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,840
will um we the way in which we adapt and

781
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,760
change

782
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,080
is based on what it is that you are all

783
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,919
doing so you're looking at new

784
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,199
technology we get forced to look at that

785
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,039
new technology so

786
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,480
so we react to what it is that's being

787
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,080
implemented in alberta

788
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,440
and um i would like to give you a

789
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,279
specific example of something i'm

790
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,840
particularly proud of that my team

791
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,919
has uh recently completed and that's um

792
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,000
the alberta trace together app the app

793
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,480
to help um track cobit so

794
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,159
um we had never looked at an app before

795
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,480
that was potentially going to have

796
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,919
you know if everybody um downloaded it

797
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,279
millions of users

798
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,279
we'd never looked at something that was

799
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,919
an app based product that was you know

800
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,760
available

801
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,679
um on um uh um you know available for

802
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,640
download on individual phones before we

803
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,440
just haven't had that

804
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,440
that experience so we suddenly had a

805
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,840
privacy impact assessment on our

806
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,440
desks that we had to look at and we had

807
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,799
to learn a lot about how apps work we

808
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,600
had to learn a lot about how

809
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,200
um how the technology was being used in

810
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,559
other parts of the world as well

811
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,480
because we wanted to do some comparative

812
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,080
analysis to see whether or not

813
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,840
there were better options out there

814
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,480
because this was fairly new for us to

815
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,879
look at

816
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,320
so we were um we were suddenly thrown

817
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,279
into this and on top of all of that

818
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,600
there's a

819
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,440
huge pressure for us to get this out in

820
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,719
order to help protect albertans right

821
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,880
that's ultimately what we're trying to

822
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,720
do is protect the privacy of albertans

823
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,080
and the longer we took to review this

824
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,360
the longer it would take for

825
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,120
organizations or for individuals to um

826
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,039
necessarily decide because we heard a

827
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,158
lot of feedback that they

828
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,360
people wanted to hear what the

829
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,240
commissioner had to say about the

830
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,959
product

831
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,360
so at the end i had two members of my

832
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,799
team

833
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,199
eric and christine who did just a

834
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,559
fantastic job on a on a report that's

835
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,960
over 60 pages

836
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,720
that where it was very very detailed

837
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,400
analysis where where

838
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,480
they looked at the system and provided

839
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,080
that comparative analysis as well

840
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,520
and produced something that's available

841
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,120
for public consumption

842
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,200
um i would say i don't expect most

843
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,120
albertans to want to read that report

844
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,039
but um it's out there and it's out there

845
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,719
for um for for those of us

846
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,640
who who want to understand better and

847
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,640
those of us in privacy and security

848
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,480
who want to see um what options are out

849
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,799
there right now and uh to see whether or

850
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,000
not

851
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,320
you know the commissioner ultimately

852
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,840
thinks that this is a uh

853
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,879
a safe and uh privacy um enhancing

854
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,240
product so

855
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,159
um and that was something that was brand

856
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,880
new and thrown on us and i can tell you

857
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,039
that they worked

858
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,960
crazy hours getting that that um that

859
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,080
analysis done and i'm very very proud of

860
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,440
that from our team

861
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,360
i think that was some really outstanding

862
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,559
work so and that's very much the way it

863
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,120
is whenever um

864
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,720
uh the government or an or organization

865
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,719
within alberta starts

866
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,240
um making some decisions and you know

867
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,000
planning some new technology that's when

868
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,480
we jump in is we we want to learn about

869
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,440
it and

870
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,880
and understand the benefits and

871
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,880
potential drawbacks so

872
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,880
we follow you guys is what we do usually

873
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,679
i'm gonna follow up with what rachel

874
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,399
started with this idea of being very

875
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,320
adaptive

876
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,000
um one of the things i've learned where

877
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,639
i've seen in the last few years and more

878
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,880
so now

879
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,799
is the skill sets that i information

880
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,159
security professionals or cyber security

881
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,120
professionals has to have

882
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,000
is increasing right so we're being asked

883
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,600
to consider

884
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,440
different and varying types of

885
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,080
technologies whether it's within the

886
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,480
typical

887
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,199
it infrastructure or looking at ics as

888
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,120
well

889
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,559
we're looking at as as we migrate more

890
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,279
towards the cloud now we got to start

891
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,720
bringing in

892
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,399
or understanding more about what that

893
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,919
environment looks like how do i manage

894
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,678
data in a cloud environment where i

895
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,799
don't have the control over it

896
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,159
so now i have to look at it from a

897
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,600
risk-based perspective and what are the

898
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,360
things that i need to consider

899
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,879
or that i need to validate or controls i

900
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,479
need to see in place so that i can

901
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,000
provide the same level of assurance in

902
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,159
that provider's environment as it would

903
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,080
be in a typical data center

904
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,279
i'm also seeing that this increased

905
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,840
requirement for things like

906
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,520
um more from a forensics perspective or

907
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,039
understanding more from a mobile device

908
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,240
what's on the mobile device how does it

909
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,080
interact with the data

910
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,080
how do i store if i am storing it how do

911
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,678
i identify or not identify myself

912
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,760
so the rachel's point about the the

913
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,279
tracing app perfect example of

914
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,520
the same thing skill sets that teams

915
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,880
need not have is to be able to adapt to

916
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,399
that different type of technology

917
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,320
look at it from a risk-based perspective

918
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,559
and then provide an objective viewpoint

919
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,600
on the new technologies coming across so

920
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,520
for me i think

921
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,120
more than anything it's that ability to

922
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,879
adapt as situations change

923
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,639
covets brought that forward and it's

924
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,600
really it's really demonstrated those

925
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,279
teams they can

926
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,360
change those that can adapt and those

927
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,840
that can approach things from a

928
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,120
different perspective and collaborate

929
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,120
differently and the last point i think

930
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,479
from my perspective and because i was

931
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,279
the late guy coming on here

932
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,880
adapting to new technologies adapting to

933
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,799
new ways of doing their business

934
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,240
how do i communicate more regularly now

935
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,600
and you know i do this in my current

936
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,120
role with executive leadership with

937
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,039
council etc how do i do this

938
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,879
from home in my bedroom as opposed to in

939
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,760
front of somebody get the same point

940
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,679
across

941
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,039
have the same impact and have the same

942
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,919
business discussions that i need to have

943
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,600
with executives

944
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,960
at least from my perspective at my level

945
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,039
as the chief security officer that's

946
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,080
what i need to change my approach and

947
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:32,158
and how i manage my business

948
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,000
thank you kevin martin yeah that's

949
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,600
excellent that's really good i'm taking

950
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,120
notes as we're going ahead here's i'm

951
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,799
like wow yeah that's a lot of things to

952
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,239
address with some good ideas for us as

953
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,679
well things that

954
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,360
you don't think about unless you're in a

955
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,840
conference like this one this is the

956
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,678
usefulness of panels like this one

957
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,120
but yes for us actually the government

958
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,480
of alberta well i'm going to start with

959
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,239
something simple we're talking about

960
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,000
implementing new tools and such

961
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,240
we're certainly implementing new

962
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,919
services but as you will all understand

963
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,200
i think a lot of us are in the public

964
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,960
sector right now

965
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,279
uh oil industry is not doing so good um

966
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,760
i'm gonna say the same with uh you know

967
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,960
things like foreign taxes so less money

968
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,720
coming in the government we're

969
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,240
dispersing money of course to help

970
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,640
albertans who are having

971
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,159
issues money-wise but also businesses

972
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,679
we're trying to help the businesses so

973
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,919
they stay afloat and such

974
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,039
so as a result our focus has very much

975
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,520
been on

976
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,240
stakeholders and keeping them up and

977
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,399
running

978
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,399
so that means at the same time less

979
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,158
money for us i.t folks the geeks that

980
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,678
would really like to run some tools to

981
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,279
make the environment better

982
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,120
so actually i've seen a little bit of a

983
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,360
different thing happen actually for us

984
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,279
it's been more a simplification

985
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,799
of the environment the rationalization

986
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,120
of the tools we're using

987
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,639
use less tools but use them better

988
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,320
leverage them better

989
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,080
and for the few tools that we're

990
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,678
implementing the other thing that i'm

991
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,360
seeing and i've been pushing it for

992
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,880
as long as i've been here over five

993
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,840
years is the idea of

994
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,679
open source there are such good products

995
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,918
out there that are even better supported

996
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,600
than some of the vendor-based products

997
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,760
that we can leverage and those are the

998
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,158
same products that very often

999
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,000
the hackers are using against us so

1000
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,039
leveraging some of those tools are very

1001
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,039
important

1002
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,799
but for us we're very much a microsoft

1003
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,600
environment so we started to actually

1004
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,760
kind of look at

1005
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,279
what do they have that i can leverage

1006
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,640
like do i need say a

1007
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,799
trend or a mcafee to do my virus check

1008
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,200
when i'm getting defender for free

1009
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,879
and atp is available like those are the

1010
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,200
considerations that we're

1011
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,240
having right now or already have had as

1012
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,320
a matter of fact

1013
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,559
so it's more simplification so we can

1014
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,678
manage better is what i'm seeing

1015
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:40,399
um where we have had to

1016
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,320
really ramp up is video conferencing has

1017
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,080
been part of our environment for a long

1018
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,439
time but it was more a side

1019
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,760
tool it's now a major focus for us

1020
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,440
the office of the corporate cio here at

1021
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,000
the government of alberta is committed

1022
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,799
to having

1023
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,760
50 of our staff working from home

1024
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,080
permanently

1025
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,519
as of christmas time it looks like it's

1026
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,879
actually going to be more like 70

1027
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,039
percent of our staff

1028
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,279
so what that means is we need really

1029
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,799
good tools to communicate better faster

1030
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,399
and be more concise

1031
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,760
and we find that that's what has been

1032
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,479
happening with the tools that we're

1033
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,799
using

1034
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,840
we're currently using webex but also

1035
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,840
we're starting to

1036
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,519
implement teams we want to do it right

1037
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,000
though we don't want to just jump into

1038
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,919
it

1039
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
again sometimes security concerns

1040
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,320
sometimes integration concerns but

1041
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,039
so we're moving gradually towards those

1042
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,200
tools and our vendors our partners have

1043
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,440
a lot of knowledge on this as well

1044
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,679
the ciscos of this world the microsoft

1045
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,640
of this world our vendors like cgi

1046
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,360
accenture on the 1gx side involve them

1047
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,039
when you can

1048
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,959
those are your partners they should be

1049
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,120
able to help you implement some of the

1050
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,640
new tools and strategies actually that

1051
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,239
that are out there to help you in this

1052
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,720
situation and that's what we've been

1053
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,159
doing

1054
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,000
but to holistically understand main

1055
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,519
comment is actually it's not necessarily

1056
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,320
going to acquire a whole bunch of new

1057
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,840
tools

1058
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,158
it really has been more a simplification

1059
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:00,399
rationalization

1060
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:02,240
and better use of what we have

1061
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,559
thank you you know that's that's very

1062
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,720
very very good

1063
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,080
and and i've been kind of you know if

1064
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,720
you could see me bending down every now

1065
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,480
and then

1066
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,399
making some notes because some excellent

1067
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,760
points by some very

1068
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:17,199
you know experienced professionals um

1069
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,039
we talked about a couple of things we

1070
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,960
talked about

1071
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,960
being very aware of our business or

1072
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,120
economic conditions

1073
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,320
very very key so that we're always

1074
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,080
pragmatic

1075
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,559
about what we ask where we take the

1076
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,039
business what recommendations we give

1077
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,200
we talked about some of the you know

1078
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:38,399
current changes we're dealing with

1079
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,919
uh which we talked about the tracing app

1080
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,399
uh tim you talked about industrial

1081
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,559
control systems critical infrastructures

1082
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,600
yet another thing we could talk about

1083
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,200
for hours

1084
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,639
uh we talked about mobility and where

1085
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,279
we're heading there and

1086
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,320
and really another key thing for me was

1087
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,320
to make sure that we're

1088
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,960
working towards simplicity and better

1089
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,480
leveraging the tool sets that we have

1090
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,399
so that we can get better economies of

1091
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,320
scale in my mind maybe is the way

1092
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,559
i like to paraphrase it one of the

1093
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,439
things that you touched on tim was

1094
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,639
the way in which you communicate and um

1095
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,359
so i mean

1096
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,919
my follow-on question would be is how

1097
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,480
have you

1098
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,440
changed the way in which you communicate

1099
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,159
with your business

1100
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,560
with your executives during this time

1101
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,040
and

1102
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,399
and martin maybe i'll just get you to

1103
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,000
lead this one off

1104
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,399
sure um actually as i mentioned the idea

1105
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,320
of

1106
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,839
video conferencing and things like that

1107
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,480
is being used big time

1108
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,599
presentations online big time keeping

1109
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,520
them simple

1110
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,639
we have all become experts as we're

1111
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,199
moving ahead

1112
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,040
uh instead of blah blah blah here's what

1113
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,918
we're doing and here's why and so on and

1114
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,480
so forth

1115
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,480
we're looking at what a cabinet and most

1116
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,320
of our deputy ministers and such

1117
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,520
require from us when we have information

1118
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,000
to communicate

1119
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,960
what do they need a briefing it's right

1120
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,079
there in the name briefing

1121
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,839
be brief quick background what are the

1122
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,320
options your recommendation

1123
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:04,078
and how you expect to be moving what

1124
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,040
you're expecting from the person who's

1125
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,680
listening to you

1126
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,079
and at that point in time go get moving

1127
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,480
so

1128
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,839
be brief with everything that you do

1129
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,839
don't go forever

1130
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:16,078
um so that's probably one of the biggest

1131
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,720
thing empowerment

1132
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,560
empowerment has been huge as well it's

1133
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,640
no longer a question of going through

1134
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,680
five different levels to get approvals

1135
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,359
for something

1136
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,078
put somebody in charge is going to be

1137
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,880
able to run the whole gambit and make it

1138
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,560
happen

1139
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,560
and get the approvals coming from that

1140
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,520
person or maybe the supervisor of that

1141
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,078
person but

1142
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,599
simplify approval processes and that's

1143
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,240
the other thing that's been happening as

1144
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,560
well

1145
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,598
this way there's less turmoil less

1146
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,359
questioning

1147
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,800
and we don't have time for the perfect

1148
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,240
solution anymore

1149
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,839
like for instance when it came to

1150
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,560
payment to albertans

1151
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:52,640
uh i'm sure some people have tried to

1152
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,119
sign up over the first couple of days

1153
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,560
when

1154
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,480
everybody was trying to log in at the

1155
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,078
same time and there were some issues

1156
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,520
we actually knew there would probably be

1157
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,480
some issues with that

1158
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,720
but it was either we do it now we make

1159
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,880
it happen and we help people right away

1160
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,480
or we fiddle around for the next three

1161
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,440
weeks try to figure out the perfect

1162
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,800
solution

1163
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,480
so that's the other thing that has

1164
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,440
simplified itself the solutions we're

1165
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,920
looking for

1166
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,560
don't look for perfect look for the best

1167
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,680
case

1168
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,759
you can make for yourself look at risks

1169
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,720
accept a certain level and then improve

1170
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,440
over time

1171
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,799
this agile methodology of delivering

1172
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,200
something quick and then

1173
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,079
repeating slices of improving the

1174
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,720
situation

1175
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,520
is way better than the old waterfall

1176
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,118
projects

1177
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,000
where we would talk about requirements

1178
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,240
for months start designing for months

1179
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,160
implement over a number of months and by

1180
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,200
the time you deliver the requirements

1181
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,118
all have changed

1182
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,680
so that's been our approach from a

1183
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,359
communication perspective

1184
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,799
thank you rachel so um

1185
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,480
i think it's actually it's quite

1186
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,560
interesting because both um

1187
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,520
tim and martin they both work in large

1188
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,560
organizations

1189
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,800
the oipc has 42 staff members

1190
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,400
um between two offices we have a small

1191
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,240
budget i think our budget last year and

1192
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,680
this is public was

1193
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,439
around 7 million dollars we don't have a

1194
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,759
lot of money so um

1195
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,760
we when when a pandemic hits we don't

1196
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,040
have spare change in the back to use we

1197
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,359
literally have that money

1198
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,520
set up for everything and uh we had to

1199
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,920
go buy laptops when when the pandemic

1200
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,240
hit

1201
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,680
um so that we had staff that could

1202
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,759
actually work from home i think we

1203
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,359
we had about three people on the in the

1204
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,960
office me being one of them that

1205
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:31,680
actually had laptops

1206
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,800
um rather than um desktops so we had a

1207
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,598
huge change

1208
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,200
um from that perspective and so and so

1209
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,520
when we talk about being able to

1210
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,960
uh communicate effectively differently

1211
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,560
we're still working on it we

1212
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,160
we don't have a great approach yet we

1213
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,520
don't use zoom we don't use

1214
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:50,960
um uh teams we don't use anything

1215
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,680
except you know good old-fashioned 1990s

1216
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,040
teleconferencing technology we don't see

1217
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,759
each other this is the first day i've

1218
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:01,359
had to dress up for work in ages like

1219
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,359
um we just talk on the phone

1220
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,839
i'm wearing shorts right now

1221
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,480
um so we just we don't have not only do

1222
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,040
we not have the resources but because of

1223
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,560
we are the the commissioner's office we

1224
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,759
we don't just implement technology

1225
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,880
without doing a privacy impact

1226
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,560
assessment first

1227
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,720
and if we do our own privacy impact

1228
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,520
assessment that certainly has different

1229
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,200
um uh it has a different feel to it

1230
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,119
shall we say than if we hire an outside

1231
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,480
organization to do that for us

1232
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,960
and we just bought a whole bunch of

1233
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,640
laptops um that weren't budgeted for and

1234
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,400
so then you know getting a

1235
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,000
an outside organization to do a privacy

1236
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,280
impact assessment for us

1237
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,040
these things are going to take time to

1238
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,760
figure out how we can financially manage

1239
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,440
that

1240
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,359
um so we're not there yet we're starting

1241
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,960
to look at some other technology that uh

1242
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,359
that we might be able to use but right

1243
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,800
now

1244
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,000
we're one of those organizations and i'm

1245
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,520
sure that there's a lot of others out

1246
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,760
there that are struggling to use

1247
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,680
what we had before um during the

1248
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,160
pandemic which was teleconferencing

1249
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,799
um for the most part and uh um and

1250
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,240
trying to

1251
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,520
try we're trying to figure out still

1252
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,560
what is the best way for us to

1253
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,440
communicate

1254
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,599
um we definitely uh we communicate with

1255
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,280
organizations a lot by email but we were

1256
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,240
doing that before as well

1257
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,440
so um we we just don't have uh we don't

1258
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,879
have a lot of um uh

1259
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,079
um we don't we just don't have the

1260
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,520
opportunity to make a lot of these

1261
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,960
changes that we'd like to be able to

1262
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,920
make as quickly as we'd like to be able

1263
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,839
to make them

1264
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,119
um it does look like we'll we'll start

1265
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,200
to head down these

1266
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,800
these paths and and start to find you

1267
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,480
know new and more innovative ways to do

1268
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,839
this because it is a bit clunky the way

1269
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,280
we're operating right now and

1270
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,720
for those of you who are working with us

1271
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,640
on privacy impact assessments or

1272
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,720
investigations i apologize

1273
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,160
um because it is clunky for us um and

1274
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,520
we're struggling a little bit

1275
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,879
sometimes we have to wait until we're

1276
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,560
going to the office and we're only

1277
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,280
really allocated one day per

1278
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,759
every two weeks to go into the office so

1279
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,599
um

1280
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,000
it's uh it's been a bit of a struggle

1281
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,839
you know um and i'm hoping that

1282
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,040
we will continue to move forward on this

1283
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,759
we um

1284
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,680
and let me just kind of uh step back and

1285
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,599
say prior to the pandemic

1286
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,359
no one at the oipc worked from home we

1287
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,640
didn't have a work from home policy

1288
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,799
and it just wasn't something that was

1289
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,400
available to us dealing with the the

1290
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,520
level of sensitivity of the information

1291
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,200
that we deal with

1292
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,720
we kept it within the secure environment

1293
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,960
of the office and we and

1294
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,640
again nobody really had laptops so this

1295
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,400
has been such a complete shift for us

1296
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,839
with not a lot of money or ability to

1297
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,640
make sudden changes

1298
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,000
um we've definitely struggled and uh um

1299
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,759
we're starting to get

1300
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,280
you know a few ideas and starting to

1301
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,040
move forward now but

1302
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,599
it's it's been it's been a really hard

1303
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,079
um turn for us for sure

1304
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,520
thanks rachel what are your thoughts

1305
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,960
well i'll just i'll kind of close it off

1306
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,000
by i'll knit a few of these things

1307
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,680
together we've

1308
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,280
we've adapted our approach we started

1309
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,759
this a few a little while ago

1310
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,680
before the pandemic hit that is changing

1311
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,119
our approach to how we communicate

1312
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,480
particularly with our our clients and

1313
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,920
our business units that we interact with

1314
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,000
but also with executives

1315
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,200
and outside agencies to martin's point

1316
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,920
yeah brief that that's

1317
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,359
yeah a page i'm a soccer crayon kind of

1318
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,079
a guy if it's a couple of pages long i'm

1319
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,000
not going to read it

1320
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,760
i don't have the kind of time so i'm

1321
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,520
trying to figure out who my audience is

1322
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,280
finds executive so i'm trying to keep it

1323
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,720
short right get to the point

1324
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,400
what's the business problem you're

1325
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,680
trying to solve what's the risk that's

1326
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,680
facing the assets

1327
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,118
that supports that business objective

1328
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,640
and what can we do to help remediate the

1329
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,880
risks so we try to keep it

1330
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,160
crisp in our communication we use a lot

1331
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,920
of technology now right

1332
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,440
more so now over the pandemic so

1333
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,520
microsoft teams is huge for us

1334
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,960
we're using other uh platforms you know

1335
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,880
as this is

1336
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,400
as another example we're also getting

1337
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,359
very good at using

1338
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,920
um the visuals from our perspective i

1339
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,480
don't know about

1340
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,200
you folks but that death by powerpoint

1341
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,440
stop just

1342
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,799
stop like get get the point across get

1343
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,400
to the point make it

1344
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,079
make it a valid business point with a

1345
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,119
risk associated to it give a remediation

1346
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,319
and get out of the room get onto the

1347
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,000
next meeting so i've

1348
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,839
i've been forcing my team to get to go

1349
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,839
down that path and the other one too is

1350
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,680
from my perspective is when we discuss

1351
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,720
or we communicate with other members

1352
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,680
of our teams but that we work with as

1353
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,919
our client base

1354
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,759
we talk about the difference between an

1355
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,319
exception to a policy and accept

1356
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,960
an acceptance of risk two different

1357
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,400
words

1358
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,920
two different meanings you know the way

1359
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,359
i look at it is one it's okay to go

1360
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,839
break the rules

1361
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,520
exception alternatively it's here's the

1362
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,440
risk and at two in the morning

1363
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,200
you're the guy understand what that

1364
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,720
means right we'll be there to help but

1365
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,759
when you make that business decision to

1366
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,480
accept the risk

1367
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,760
that risk is now on you and that's when

1368
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,760
we get to some really interesting

1369
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,520
conversations with executives because

1370
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,839
the points being made that this is now a

1371
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,680
business decision to accept the risk

1372
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,200
or would you like to work with our team

1373
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,440
and the it operations group

1374
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,799
to help reduce the risk so those are

1375
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,760
things i've seen change at least in the

1376
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,280
last couple years

1377
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,720
but throughout my career this idea of

1378
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,440
talking about things from a business

1379
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,879
perspective

1380
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,160
changing the language that we have as

1381
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,440
security professionals so it's a

1382
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,520
business discussion not a

1383
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,800
put up a hand and say no now i want to

1384
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,319
talk about the problem can we look at it

1385
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,400
from a business perspective

1386
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,400
keep it brief to the point gain their

1387
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,160
attention get their acceptance

1388
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,960
move on thank you so some some excellent

1389
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,160
points there

1390
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,839
and really um if i could surmise just

1391
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,720
snippets of it's around

1392
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,440
communicating briefly communicating

1393
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,480
value

1394
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:11,520
and risk and and and the note there

1395
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:14,560
is is yes the the days of no

1396
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,160
well i think they're gone long gone

1397
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,160
uh hopefully none of us are doing that

1398
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,319
anymore but it's making sure

1399
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,000
that we're communicating effectively so

1400
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:25,440
that business executives

1401
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,440
can make informed risk decisions because

1402
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,040
taking risk is not bad and businesses

1403
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,720
take risk all the time

1404
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,079
it's just a matter of understanding and

1405
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,240
quantifying

1406
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,319
what it is that you're taking on and for

1407
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,160
how long you will take that on

1408
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,480
and maintaining that so that you don't

1409
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,920
lose sight of that in a year or two or

1410
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,000
three so that you have

1411
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,000
the opportunity to pivot back and close

1412
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,400
things if that that's

1413
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,560
something that makes sense so i'm just

1414
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,200
doing a bit of a time check so it's uh

1415
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,960
almost 150 so running a little tight on

1416
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,598
time i do have

1417
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,040
one more question to ask and then uh we

1418
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,680
have a couple of questions from the

1419
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,000
audience

1420
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,279
that uh i'd like us to tackle if

1421
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,079
possible

1422
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,680
so this could be a you know an

1423
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,920
interesting one so i was kind of looking

1424
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,919
forward to this one left at the last

1425
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,520
my last question is do you see do you

1426
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,040
foresee any changes

1427
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:21,200
on the horizon to privacy legislation

1428
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:23,920
and or cyber security standards

1429
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,000
i will start uh rachel i'm going to

1430
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,440
leave you to last

1431
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,640
so tim i'm just going to go with you

1432
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,359
craig thanks for that hannie i

1433
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:36,400
appreciate it um from my end yeah i do

1434
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:38,480
actually i i do see changes and i'm not

1435
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,200
going to overstep here but i see changes

1436
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,000
at least from you know the linking more

1437
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,839
now between

1438
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,359
privacy requirements and security

1439
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,640
controls that should be in place to

1440
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:49,040
reduce the risk

1441
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,640
and i'm i was a big fan of the gdpr when

1442
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,359
it came out in europe

1443
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,240
all 834 pages but you know a good hunk

1444
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,720
of it

1445
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,560
um should we see some of that come here

1446
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,000
i think we should i know

1447
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,000
i know some folks don't think that it's

1448
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,359
you know that it's a fairly hefty piece

1449
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,800
of legislation but when you take a look

1450
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,520
at the premise behind it

1451
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,119
i think as a canadian would be really i

1452
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,560
think would be well served if we follow

1453
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,880
that type of change or that type of

1454
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,000
structure for the way that we manage

1455
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,599
the data that we need to hold

1456
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,800
confidential and private i think as

1457
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,800
security professionals it's going to

1458
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,280
become more and more upon us as

1459
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,240
organizations that hold data for for

1460
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,720
citizens

1461
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,200
for customers etc we need to do a better

1462
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,359
job of demonstrating how we've done that

1463
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,799
so i'm i'm a fan of looking at it from a

1464
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,240
security perspective

1465
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,680
this is going to sound way out there and

1466
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,240
i'll start out there for martin to pick

1467
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,759
on me but

1468
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,359
what if you started legislating security

1469
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,680
controls you had to have in place

1470
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:41,359
some of what we do for pci what about

1471
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,598
other requirements

1472
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,880
and why not right if we're doing our job

1473
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,400
well then focusing on the risk and

1474
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,960
putting in the right control why can't

1475
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,400
we

1476
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,240
what if we were just doing our job

1477
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,480
really well right

1478
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,839
and we did not be told how to do it i

1479
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,800
think that'd be a great idea and i think

1480
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,560
what that would do is

1481
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,839
it would set the tone for executives as

1482
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,400
they start looking at things moving

1483
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,078
forward

1484
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,960
so i'll start the brawl here and i'll

1485
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,800
let martin jump in here

1486
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,160
actually it would be a brawl if i was

1487
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,240
not an agreement i'm actually

1488
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,399
going through a lot of what you said but

1489
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,319
i'm going to say it goes beyond

1490
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,880
regulations and such it goes also

1491
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:16,880
towards education training and awareness

1492
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,480
we can no longer have just the security

1493
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,319
people being the experts and the

1494
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,920
information management people knowing

1495
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,520
the policies inside out

1496
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,280
we need to get to a point where the

1497
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,400
general population and certainly our

1498
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,720
young people

1499
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,599
are trained very young to understand the

1500
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,359
risks and

1501
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:34,079
uh uh that they take sometimes with uh

1502
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,920
you know just

1503
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,440
giving their name or giving their email

1504
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,880
address or something like that when they

1505
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,359
go to the store or something like that

1506
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,480
you know

1507
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:45,680
that needs to to come into play uh

1508
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,760
so i'm gonna say here um

1509
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,279
i'm actually a proponent of changing

1510
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,440
some of the rules okay and

1511
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,960
let me let me actually be more precise

1512
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,560
on this one

1513
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,160
i don't think we need new rules as per

1514
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,599
se we need to adapt them

1515
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,520
okay so a lot of the regulations that

1516
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:02,079
exist are in terms of records and i'm

1517
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,160
talking

1518
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:06,160
paper records like the government of

1519
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,040
alberta official records have been

1520
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,520
historically

1521
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,920
paper records the digital records are

1522
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:15,040
usually a copy of the paper records

1523
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:18,079
um we need to move to the digitized

1524
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:21,359
world we need to have records sorry

1525
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,240
database type policies and such so some

1526
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,720
of the

1527
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,160
acts and regulations that exist they are

1528
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,078
there very often to do things like

1529
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:32,000
foreign protect records of course but

1530
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:35,200
they will say things like you can't have

1531
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,520
this data this particular data set

1532
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,279
outside of the province of alberta well

1533
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,800
when you're in a digitized service and

1534
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,160
you move to the cloud

1535
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:46,000
pretty darn difficult to accomplish and

1536
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,440
this is where i'm gonna put the plug-in

1537
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,280
that we were discussing before the

1538
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,839
meeting actually rachel

1539
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,880
we have an oipc that's very

1540
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,960
forward-looking

1541
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,559
here in alberta we're super lucky with

1542
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,240
that they are looking at tools

1543
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,720
they are looking at doing the way we're

1544
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,319
doing business and they understand it

1545
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,839
so that we can actually work with them

1546
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,240
to come up with solutions that make

1547
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,520
sense

1548
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,919
but i'm going to tell you that there's a

1549
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,720
lot of provinces and territories and

1550
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,960
jurisdiction

1551
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,959
in this country right now that are not

1552
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,440
able to move towards modernizing their

1553
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:19,200
services and digitizing their services

1554
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:22,400
because their own oipc's or the powers

1555
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:25,040
that be in their province or territory

1556
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,559
still look at things the old way can't

1557
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,839
do business outside of canada

1558
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,760
can't do business outside of the

1559
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,759
province in some cases outside of the

1560
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,559
cities even for municipalities i've

1561
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,559
heard

1562
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,599
so this is something that's very

1563
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,000
important we should

1564
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,839
adapt all those regulation rules and so

1565
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,760
on and so forth that have been in place

1566
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,599
but i agree that we should have more

1567
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,839
security based regulation

1568
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,599
i'm gonna throw in right now because i

1569
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,759
saw our vendor putting a question about

1570
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:52,160
mfa

1571
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,920
the biggest vector to get into

1572
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,920
organizations right now is email

1573
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,839
phishing where you obtain credentials

1574
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,599
if people believe that their information

1575
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,440
is well protected because they have a

1576
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:04,319
username and a password

1577
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,359
good luck i hate passwords we need to go

1578
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,680
beyond that we

1579
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,759
need to go into biometrics digital

1580
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,640
certificates things like that

1581
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,960
whatever shape or way we we do it but

1582
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,799
mfa should become a regulation

1583
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,800
literally some kind of an act or

1584
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,680
something like that for anything that

1585
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,000
involve private personal information i

1586
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,640
think

1587
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,640
any solution that's in the cloud any

1588
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,720
solution that's digitized

1589
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,720
should have mfa in place to protect you

1590
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,799
it's too easy to get in with just a

1591
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,680
simple password they can be hacked

1592
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,559
so easily but a second factor of

1593
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,520
authentication

1594
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,200
even if it's like a call back device my

1595
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,200
telephone is registered somebody's

1596
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,759
trying to access my account or one of my

1597
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,680
records

1598
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,200
and i get a notification on my phone

1599
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,640
with the authorization number or

1600
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,799
something

1601
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,640
perfect this is what we need to protect

1602
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,240
ourselves and this is where maybe we

1603
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,920
should look into regulations in the

1604
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:59,200
future

1605
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,319
thank you rachel well this is a hard one

1606
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,319
for me because there's so

1607
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,680
much i could talk about um the first

1608
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,558
thing i always like to start off by

1609
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,759
saying is that

1610
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:08,079
the commissioner doesn't write the

1611
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,839
legislation um she regulates it

1612
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,200
so there's often a misconception that

1613
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,799
the commissioner has the ability to

1614
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,000
actually change the legislation there's

1615
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,520
a lot of things in it that we don't

1616
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,880
particularly like either and we'd like

1617
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:20,480
to see updated and change

1618
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:23,040
so with that in mind um i would say that

1619
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,480
um i wanted to pick up on on something

1620
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,000
that tim had said actually

1621
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,680
i think it's really really important

1622
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,119
that we do look at some other

1623
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,279
legislation and look at modern

1624
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,559
modernizing what we have the gdpr has

1625
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,520
some great concepts around data

1626
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,119
processors

1627
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,440
i'd love to see that what we have right

1628
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,880
now um we call them information managers

1629
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,000
under the health information act and to

1630
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,760
be able to have a little bit more

1631
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,599
authority on some of the work that they

1632
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,440
do a little bit more direct authority

1633
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,359
i think would be really helpful it is

1634
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,200
very rare nowadays where we come across

1635
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:50,160
an organization that isn't dealing with

1636
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,118
at least one

1637
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,480
data um at least one data processor um

1638
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,839
sometimes there's seven or eight within

1639
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,680
an organization and a specific

1640
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:59,680
investigation that we're dealing with

1641
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,279
and it gets very very complicated that

1642
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,759
way so be nice to have some uh

1643
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,359
some changes like that um i would say

1644
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,000
that uh the health information act

1645
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:09,920
specifically needs to be modernized

1646
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,599
it needs it needs to be updated it needs

1647
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,760
to look at some things around

1648
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,359
use secondary use of data it really

1649
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,559
doesn't address that very well and it

1650
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:19,598
doesn't really address

1651
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,520
um data repositories either

1652
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,720
we do there's a there's an opportunity

1653
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:26,240
there for um

1654
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,558
regulation on on um on data repositories

1655
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,479
but

1656
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,000
it it's not there it was never written

1657
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,640
so it would be nice to have some of that

1658
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,599
work

1659
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,799
updated and done as well um in terms of

1660
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,880
the public sector

1661
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,920
i would really like to see a mandatory

1662
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,880
breach reporting

1663
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,880
in the public sector government holds a

1664
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,599
lot of really important really sensitive

1665
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,359
data on

1666
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,599
on albertans and it would be nice to

1667
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:49,200
have um

1668
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,040
to have notification if that information

1669
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,558
goes awry and right now it's the only

1670
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,759
piece of legislation in alberta that

1671
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,119
doesn't have mandatory breach

1672
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,200
notification because

1673
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,720
the health information act does as does

1674
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,399
our private sector legislation so i

1675
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,520
think that that's really missing

1676
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,319
and then i'm going to throw this out

1677
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,319
there and sound a little bit

1678
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:06,240
controversial as well maybe but

1679
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,920
um private sector legislation if you

1680
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,200
look um globally there's there's

1681
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,119
definitely a trend in this

1682
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,240
and we can even see this um happening in

1683
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:14,000
ontario

1684
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,720
where uh commissioners offices are

1685
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,280
actually getting some opportunity to

1686
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,879
um to actually levy fines i know that

1687
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,839
the uk commissioner does this a lot for

1688
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,960
example but there's

1689
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:26,319
it's growing in popularity and before um

1690
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,760
before you think oh my goodness we

1691
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:29,839
shouldn't let the commissioner do that

1692
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,440
um the commissioner does already but we

1693
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:33,359
go through the court system so what are

1694
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,280
we doing right now in alberta we have a

1695
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:37,359
huge backlog in our court systems

1696
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,200
and the pandemic made that a lot worse

1697
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:41,279
so then our investigations

1698
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,359
are um are getting held up in those as

1699
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,359
well where individuals

1700
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,720
or organizations may be fined and it

1701
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:47,279
would be nice to actually see some of

1702
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,480
that

1703
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,559
where there could be a little bit more

1704
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,160
direct um rather than us having to go

1705
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,680
through the court systems to do it

1706
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,879
having said that i do want to clarify

1707
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,319
that that's my opinion and not the

1708
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,240
opinion of the commissioner

1709
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:59,520
um but i do think that that's that's a

1710
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,160
real trend in the private sector

1711
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,440
legislation

1712
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,520
and i'd like to see that in all of the

1713
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,960
legislation as well so that um

1714
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,000
commissioners have the direct ability

1715
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,839
rather than going through the court

1716
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,960
system which just seems like a

1717
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:11,520
um a much slower process and um just

1718
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,760
doesn't

1719
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,880
it's just not efficient um for what

1720
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,880
we're looking at so

1721
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,559
i could probably talk forever about some

1722
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,760
of the other pieces that were mentioned

1723
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:21,839
like the

1724
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,680
the uh legislating some security

1725
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:25,119
controls we do have a little bit of that

1726
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,399
in the health information act and some

1727
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,720
regulations but

1728
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,160
um the difficulty with that of course is

1729
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,439
that our legislation does not get

1730
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:34,720
updated fast enough and

1731
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,359
and security changes right so um there's

1732
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,200
always that

1733
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,240
there's that caveat there that well we

1734
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,160
could do it but then it's gonna be

1735
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:42,479
outdated in a couple of years and

1736
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,920
you know um the acts just don't get they

1737
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,359
don't they might get a few amendments

1738
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,880
periodically but actually getting a

1739
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:49,920
thorough review and update

1740
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:52,480
it's rare um for it to happen so um

1741
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,160
so you know it'd be nice if we could do

1742
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,720
that but i i just i'm not sure that it

1743
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,598
would be

1744
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,200
as practical as we'd like um so i'll

1745
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,119
stop there because i could go on forever

1746
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,720
and ever on this one

1747
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:05,119
thank you so much and i really do

1748
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:08,319
appreciate the passion with which

1749
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:11,119
each of you is um is speaking and and

1750
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:12,880
appreciate the expertise so so that was

1751
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,440
my last question and i know right now

1752
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,280
there are people

1753
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,480
probably texting me to say you're

1754
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,079
running out of time

1755
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,839
so i'm just going to take the liberty of

1756
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,440
going a couple of minutes over time

1757
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:23,680
i'm trying to answer at least one

1758
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:26,319
question that we have from the audience

1759
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,240
and and that question is um i think it's

1760
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:31,119
probably meant for you rachel

1761
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,720
what is the oipc guidance on privacy

1762
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,200
impact assessments

1763
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,160
or cloud computing projects related to

1764
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,200
alberta's

1765
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,920
pii but tim and martin you may also want

1766
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,759
to add

1767
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,920
rachel could we begin with you well i

1768
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,960
think the safe guidance would be do them

1769
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,240
please do a privacy impact assessment

1770
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,160
if you're in the health sector it would

1771
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,680
be mandatory um if you're in the public

1772
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,000
or private sector we'd look at it we'd

1773
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,240
review

1774
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,440
it for sure and provide guidance we do

1775
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,799
have some guidance and there's some

1776
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,400
guidance i think federally as

1777
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:03,520
well around cloud computing um and um

1778
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:05,119
not not not not to make light of it but

1779
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,400
i would say that another really smart

1780
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,720
idea is

1781
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,000
investigate the the cloud computing

1782
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,598
products that you're using

1783
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,200
um you've probably heard of the

1784
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,440
blackbaud breach which has affected

1785
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:18,078
millions of albertans and that's a cloud

1786
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:20,079
cloud computing technology right that's

1787
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,839
public information that's out there um

1788
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,079
so you know and and there are cloud

1789
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,480
providers that that do get attacked so

1790
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,079
really

1791
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,079
be careful about the ones that you

1792
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,520
choose and do a really thorough review

1793
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,680
and make sure that your contracts with

1794
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,280
those organizations have

1795
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,440
enough detail in there that you get

1796
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:38,000
notified right away if there is a breach

1797
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,520
um or some other kind of compromise um

1798
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,480
we do have some there is some guidance

1799
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,599
available though both

1800
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,720
um uh i think it's federally um i can't

1801
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:47,200
to be honest with you it's a couple of

1802
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,720
years old now so i'm not sure if um

1803
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,960
we actually signed on to it as well we

1804
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,399
might have so um so there is some out

1805
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,240
there but yes please do them

1806
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,440
and uh we were happy to review them

1807
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,359
we're also happy to

1808
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,960
take a phone call and just um provide

1809
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:01,119
some general ideas and

1810
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,640
uh um depending on what it is you're

1811
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,839
looking at as well

1812
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,200
the other thing i would say is one of

1813
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,119
the most common breaches we received

1814
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,919
recently and i'll end with this

1815
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:11,359
is um around amazon web buckets and

1816
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,760
people just forgetting to add the

1817
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:15,680
security on the amazon web bucket

1818
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,040
so they just buy it as is and it doesn't

1819
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,399
have the security in it and they start

1820
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,160
using it and then the information is

1821
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,400
freely available on the web so

1822
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,160
um you know um just watch some of the

1823
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,599
basics like that as well i think amazon

1824
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,118
actually may have fixed that now so that

1825
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,119
it's that's not the case

1826
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,319
um but we we definitely saw a large

1827
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,319
number of breaches

1828
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:34,400
just related to not you know addressing

1829
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:36,960
the security when you buy the product

1830
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,359
um so that would be a pretty basic um

1831
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,480
place to start i think too

1832
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:43,200
gentlemen is there anything you'd want

1833
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,640
to add to that yeah honey there's

1834
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,319
to rachel's point there's a couple of

1835
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,440
free resources you can get or resource

1836
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,200
you can get online as well cloud

1837
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,319
security alliance just an update on

1838
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:54,000
their control review that you can do

1839
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:55,759
before you start looking at a cloud

1840
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,520
service and they've also got a series of

1841
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,200
risk questions that you should be asking

1842
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:01,200
your executives so that they understand

1843
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,480
that when you want to move to the cloud

1844
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,919
here's the risk that you need to start

1845
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,319
answering and that's everything from how

1846
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,559
do you

1847
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:08,000
manage the data itself what are the

1848
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,359
different types of controls how do you

1849
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,480
demonstrate assurance that those

1850
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,160
controls are actually operating

1851
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,359
effectively and efficiently so

1852
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,640
if you get a chance go to the cloud

1853
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:16,078
security alliance they've got some great

1854
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,279
tools there if you are looking at a

1855
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,880
cloud-based product or

1856
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,240
cloud-based solution and some of the

1857
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,200
risks you should be assessing and some

1858
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,720
of the controls

1859
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,000
you know to rachel's point about amazon

1860
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,558
that you really should be asking your

1861
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,319
vendor

1862
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:28,799
prior to signing up and shipping data up

1863
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:28,799
into the cloud

1864
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:34,160
i can only leverage what team was just

1865
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,040
tim was just mentioning right now i

1866
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,799
totally agree

1867
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,960
the one thing i'm going to add to it is

1868
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:40,640
information classification

1869
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,400
implement information classification

1870
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,400
schemes so that instead of dealing with

1871
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,559
every piece of data as a one-off trying

1872
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,720
to figure out the risk around it

1873
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,319
imagine buckets you know your most

1874
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,879
sensitive information to the least

1875
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:54,880
sensitive even to public

1876
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,720
kind of figure out ahead of time what

1877
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,520
kind of protections level and what

1878
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:01,919
kind of risks your your organization is

1879
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,079
willing to take regarding these buckets

1880
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,359
then later on all you have to do is take

1881
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:07,280
a piece of information

1882
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:08,880
fit it can fit it in the right bucket

1883
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,559
and you don't have a whole bunch of work

1884
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,160
to do it's done already it's been done

1885
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,319
with your classification

1886
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:17,040
leverage information classification for

1887
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:18,880
these kind of activities too

1888
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,359
perfect the only thing i would have said

1889
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:24,720
in in addition to supplement

1890
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:26,078
the excellent response was yeah cmc iso

1891
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,640
have some good things but there are also

1892
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:29,680
some

1893
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:31,920
some good general key controls

1894
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,200
that come from the federal government

1895
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,720
and so

1896
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,640
the government of canada does this as a

1897
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,598
part of its partnership with the five

1898
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,440
eyes

1899
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,680
and you know it's yet another

1900
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,359
conversation what are those key controls

1901
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,960
and how do you deploy them whether

1902
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:47,119
you're on premise or

1903
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,400
whatever cloud solution your platform

1904
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,319
you're looking to leverage

1905
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,520
but but yes you don't have to reinvent

1906
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:54,319
the wheel

1907
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,880
having said that i know i'm over time

1908
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,759
but i

1909
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:00,000
i want to quickly really express my

1910
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,640
gratitude to the three of you and

1911

willing to share the time to share the

1914
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,279
wisdom

1915
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,558
so thank you so very much uh very
