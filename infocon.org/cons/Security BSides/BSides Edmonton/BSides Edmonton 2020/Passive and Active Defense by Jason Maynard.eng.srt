1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:07,648
okay so Jason Maynard from Cisco it's

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,620
gonna do a talk on active and passive

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,450
defense we also understand that there

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,549
are some Nate's students who are coming

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,619
into this so it's just a show of hands

6
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:22,880
are those Nate's students here welcome

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:25,650
great good okay so let's get this up

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:31,530
alright everyone can hear me yeah

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:34,860
awesome all right so I'm Jason Maynard

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:37,170
I'm focused on the technical aspects of

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,480
Cisco cyber security portfolio but

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,840
really focused in general around

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,519
security not product specific great so

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,380
anyways when I was thinking about what I

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,300
want kind of present some of the

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,640
challenge I see when I'm out and talking

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,890
to customers was that there's a big

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,450
focus on passive defense right and we'll

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,320
talk a little bit of what what passive

20
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:00,450
defense is there's not a huge focus on

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,370
active defense so today there's gonna be

22
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,070
a little bit of everything for everyone

23
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,389
right so if you're in leadership there's

24
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,270
some things that you might want to take

25
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:11,068
back to the team if you're you know more

26
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,670
on the geeky side we'll talk a bit about

27
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:17,729
net flow and maybe DNS analysis and and

28
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,079
how that might help you determine what

29
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,759
may be an adversary you might be doing

30
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,919
in your environment obviously that's

31
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,310
only one of many techniques that you can

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,469
leverage but it's a good it's a good way

33
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,020
of capturing some Intel in your

34
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:33,839
environment right so if you know if we

35
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,719
have lots of people in here that manage

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,189
environments I would love to see and I'm

37
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,928
not sure if you guys are willing to say

38
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:43,619
but how many people actually ingest

39
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:46,349
NetFlow or IP fix or s flow or J flow

40
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:49,789
and actually use that not from a network

41
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:53,759
perspective but use it for security

42
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:56,159
right so we're building these defenses

43
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,689
or traditional defenses to mitigate risk

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,459
but yet you don't know what your

45
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,469
networks doing right day in and day out

46
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:04,439
so we'll talk a little bit about that

47
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,020
today as well as what DNS can do and

48
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,549
provide you so real quick and you talk

49
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,829
about operational and informational

50
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,230
technologies right there's a big focus

51
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:14,879
obviously on IT a lot of the times but

52
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,119
operational environments are now being

53
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,730
the

54
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,209
supposed businesses want data right

55
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:23,640
today you can go and order food right

56
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:26,250
and watch the driver come to your house

57
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,720
right the best I had as a kid was 20

58
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,489
minutes Domino's it's free

59
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,200
right that but you never knew where they

60
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:33,239
were you were just hoping they'd be here

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,190
right today you guys are seeing things

62
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,220
real-time people know when you know

63
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,420
consumption for power is high or low so

64
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,890
we'll talk about each of those because

65
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,170
they're both important and they both

66
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,238
require security both both passive

67
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:48,179
defenses but also active defenses as

68
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,579
well we'll talk about a hard exterior

69
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,120
soft interior I've seen that still a lot

70
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:55,530
ooh with all of my customers that I talk

71
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,180
to you day in and day out right we've

72
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:01,079
got this hard cross but we got this

73
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,819
really gooey chewy middle right we'll

74
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:04,500
talk about passive and active defense

75
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,000
very high-level the differences between

76
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,489
the two and then we're really going to

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,480
focus on active defense itself so that's

78
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:11,780
where we're gonna look at threat

79
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,790
intelligence right asset identification

80
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,890
network security monitoring Incident

81
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,989
Response and then finally threat

82
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,899
environment and manipulation right so

83
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,819
what do we take from the things that we

84
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,280
learn about the environment and then use

85
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:28,619
that to feed back into our passive

86
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,900
defenses right so we take that knowledge

87
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,519
and then we feed it back into passive

88
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,519
defenses to start mitigating that risk

89
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:40,619
so when you look at operational and

90
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:44,220
informational technologies they're both

91
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,260
important right so if they might be

92
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,959
treated a little bit differently so ot

93
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,239
you know it's got engineers

94
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,209
right and you know real engineers with

95
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,239
the ring right and then I t's got

96
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:59,099
engineers without the ring right hey a

97
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,199
lot of times not to say you don't have a

98
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:03,510
ring somebody might have a ring but

99
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,180
they're very much the same and they can

100
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,668
learn from each other right IT can learn

101
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,199
about the operational requirements right

102
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:13,859
and why it's important to make sure

103
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:17,130
availability is core right integrity is

104
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:18,810
second and confidentiality is third if

105
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,399
you were going to rank them you could

106
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,190
talk to people that will argue all day

107
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:26,070
long that that confidentiality and

108
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,930
integrity is just as important but

109
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,360
without availability the operational

110
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,810
environment

111
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,389
and will suffer right where IT you've

112
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,430
got CIA right confidentiality integrity

113
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:37,629
and availability right if you were to

114
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,909
rank them again you could talk to

115
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:43,569
someone in IT and say availability is

116
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:44,889
just as important as confidentiality but

117
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:47,229
if you were to rank them that's

118
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:50,939
typically how it goes so now we've

119
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:54,159
gotten some controls between ot and IT

120
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:56,439
but how many organizations are actually

121
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:58,569
doing active defense in the operational

122
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:01,949
environment and I'm gonna say very few

123
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:05,680
right I talk to a lot of customers and

124
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:07,780
the problem with this is Oh T is now it

125
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,819
used to be an island right all by itself

126
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,979
but now we've got bridges into that

127
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:14,169
Island right they're not segregated

128
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:18,580
anymore so we'll talk a little bit about

129
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:21,729
those challenges as we go along hard

130
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,979
exterior and soft interior right so you

131
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:28,060
got DNS layer protection you got

132
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:30,729
firewalls you have IPS is right you

133
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:34,360
might have some sandboxing technologies

134
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:37,750
right but at the end of the day you've

135
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,300
got this nice hard crust but in IT for

136
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:43,090
example that crust or that perimeter is

137
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:46,120
still required but we have challenges

138
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:49,719
because now we've got cloud right we've

139
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:52,029
got mobility so if you're securing an

140
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:54,900
organization you're putting millions of

141
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:58,629
dollars in defenses on the perimeter and

142
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:02,378
you let an asset go home and plug in to

143
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:04,180
the network and come back in are you

144
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:06,819
putting the organization at risk I would

145
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,639
say you are and why wouldn't the same

146
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:12,539
controls you have on-prem exist off

147
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:15,729
brown why are we taking this approach

148
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:17,500
that once you go off brown those

149
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:19,150
controls don't matter anymore right

150
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,250
those controls should follow you at

151
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:24,669
least to whatever the technology will

152
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,889
allow you to do so when you look at soft

153
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:29,049
and interior there's things like

154
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:31,599
localized malware right something that

155
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,729
gets plugged in a USB key for example

156
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:39,729
right gets plugged in starts to

157
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:43,440
propagate you have network behavior how

158
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:46,510
many people here baseline their network

159
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,040
right some right but a lot of people

160
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,140
don't even know what the communication

161
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,810
channels are between their devices you

162
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,849
are a hundred percent reliant on your

163
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,170
defense of technologies to tell you that

164
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,450
something bad is happening in the

165
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,340
environment the one thing I'll tell you

166
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,750
doesn't matter what vendor you leverage

167
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,140
nobody's going to give you a hundred

168
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:06,460
percent security you will be breached

169
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,500
right and you want to have tools in

170
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:12,039
place that are gonna help you during

171
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,390
that time so you got supply chain a lot

172
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,010
of people don't even think about it so

173
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,890
we've seen the adversary go and

174
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:21,010
compromise the website manipulate the

175
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:23,620
firmware upload it and then the customer

176
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,320
goes to the website downloads the

177
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:29,290
firmware installs it on their asset and

178
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,120
they're compromised right so you want

179
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:34,290
trust throughout that whole lifecycle

180
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,510
from a supply chain perspective

181
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:44,980
vulnerabilities right how many people

182
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:49,000
patch liars okay we all want to patch

183
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:50,680
right everybody in there throughout my

184
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,290
entire career we've talked about

185
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,510
patching but we're still seeing

186
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,220
compromises of vulnerabilities that have

187
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,590
patches that are available that haven't

188
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,760
actually been pushed out why because the

189
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,349
business doesn't want to shut it down

190
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,770
it's not that you guys don't say patch

191
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:07,570
it's important of course you are right

192
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,090
but at the end of the day the business

193
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:13,210
is driving when when when I first

194
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:15,489
started someone say can I do this no I

195
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,840
was god it was awesome like you guys

196
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,550
missed out some of the younger folks

197
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:22,599
right you know what I'm talking about

198
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:24,780
can we do this no you're never gonna be

199
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,040
able to do that right that's no longer

200
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,229
right the business comes in and says

201
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:34,150
this is what I want you to do make it

202
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:36,429
happen so it's changed so you got things

203
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,709
like sanction devices unsanctioned

204
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:42,309
devices how do you know a printers

205
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:45,610
plugged in Michael and and Zoey Freight

206
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:46,839
they've talked about printers but do you

207
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,310
know what printers are plugged into your

208
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:49,839
network do you know when the phone's

209
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,459
plugged into the network do you have a

210
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,990
dynamic understanding of what the

211
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:55,300
environment is doing at any given time

212
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,970
if you're only a hundred percent reliant

213
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,219
on those

214
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,470
action mechanisms you better have them

215
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:05,180
everywhere right and now you've got a

216
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:06,589
costing issue so anyways the stand and

217
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,540
we see this a lot we still see this a

218
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:11,180
nighty but you see this a lot more and

219
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,620
ot right if you talk to engineer and say

220
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,180
why do we need to do this right we've

221
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,829
got this crust this crust his heart

222
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,930
right you can't break first off the

223
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:18,589
crust is never hard 100% right we

224
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,529
already know that

225
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:24,019
never mind the challenges with internal

226
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:25,339
if I wanted to compromise an operational

227
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:28,279
environment what do you think I'm gonna

228
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:32,329
do well maybe what I'll do is go run to

229
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:34,399
a field location get a one gig USB key

230
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:37,489
put some good stuff on it and drop it at

231
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:41,360
the gate and drive away field engineer

232
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:43,819
comes up and goes oh my gig you've got a

233
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,029
ski try this is fantastic it's my lucky

234
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:46,790
day

235
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:49,040
right goes in plugs into the operational

236
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:52,099
environment plugs in that USB key and

237
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,599
back right and I know most people are

238
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,490
focused on security here and you

239
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,980
probably all sit here and say I would

240
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,500
never do that

241
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:06,110
yeah you would I just need to change the

242
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:09,250
size of the drive right one terabyte oh

243
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:12,980
I know what I'm doing I got this right

244
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:14,240
so there's some challenges there that

245
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,860
you got to think about so passive

246
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,899
defense is focusing on deploying and

247
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,790
maintaining the the controls that you

248
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:22,670
put in place right ultimately reducing

249
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:24,379
risk active defense is now monitoring

250
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,870
the environment right for which you're

251
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:28,160
responsible for and a lot of people

252
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,629
don't really understand what the

253
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,079
environment is that they're responsible

254
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,519
for

255
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,089
you know what has switches and firewalls

256
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,459
and routers and you know printers and

257
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:39,680
phones but you don't truly understand

258
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:41,300
the extent of all the devices that are

259
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,719
connected to it so you're probably

260
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:47,120
taking a precautionary approach to this

261
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,889
so once you understand the environment

262
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,779
then you're gonna respond to incidents

263
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:53,540
right and hopefully with some level of

264
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:56,079
accuracy right so you're not chasing the

265
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,490
rabbit down all kinds of different holes

266
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,170
and then what you're gonna do is learn

267
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,699
from that and then manipulate the

268
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,769
environment right so you're gonna take

269
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:05,449
that information you're gonna feed it

270
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:07,540
back into those passive defenses to

271
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:09,819
start mitigating risk right

272
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,050
and of course you know it's a cycle

273
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,300
right so you're gonna learn every time

274
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:16,930
you're gonna evolve right as you go

275
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:20,229
along so when you look at passive

276
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:24,370
defenses right we've got next-generation

277
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:26,800
IPS is next-gen firewalls right next-gen

278
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:30,130
endpoint I have to use the word next-gen

279
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,140
I apologize right but that's what people

280
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,939
use to understand is that when I go in

281
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,160
and I say oh yeah we've got IPS or

282
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:39,820
they've got IPS they go oh it's not

283
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,589
next-gen it is next-gen the problem with

284
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,210
the next-gen label and everybody in this

285
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:46,560
room should challenge it is it never

286
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:48,970
expires so if I was an 8 year old

287
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,949
company that developed an or was

288
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,840
innovated and created a next-gen

289
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:56,020
firewall yeah there's core components

290
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,790
that make up what they call next-gen but

291
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,939
if I did that eight years ago and did

292
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:03,939
nothing didn't change anything and eight

293
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:07,270
years later next-gen firewall right it's

294
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:09,940
still a next-gen it never expires so

295
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:12,850
next-gen doesn't always mean next-gen

296
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:15,370
right because then is it next-gen

297
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,350
next-gen or is it next-gen 2.0 right

298
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:20,560
there's some challenges with that term

299
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:23,440
in my mind anyway you got DNS email

300
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,910
security web content again just gives

301
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,420
you an idea of some of the passive

302
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,949
capabilities when you look at act at the

303
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,630
threat of Defense there's four

304
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,140
components and this is from sans right

305
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:37,060
so you got threat intelligence

306
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:40,360
consumption how many people take in

307
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,770
threat feeds probably a lot right even

308
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,720
if you don't even know you take it in

309
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:46,780
most of your security technologies is

310
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,240
pulling in threat data right you're

311
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:52,660
gonna have the next step would be things

312
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,180
like network identification right and

313
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,160
this one's critical this is the

314
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:00,339
advantage you have over the adversary

315
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,100
you know your environment they don't

316
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,720
know your environment they can assume

317
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,600
but they don't know your environment so

318
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,150
the more you know the better that you

319
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,120
could defend against the adversary right

320
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:14,709
because they've got to come in and learn

321
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,380
incident response rate obviously is a

322
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:19,750
part of it and then threat environment

323
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,769
or threat and environment manipulation

324
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,850
so we'll talk about

325
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:29,499
one of those so anybody know Locard's

326
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:31,989
exchange principle anybody so basically

327
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:33,730
if you're a criminal or an adversary so

328
00:13:31,989 --> 00:13:38,709
if I'm an adversary and I enter an

329
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:40,540
environment and I do nothing or if I

330
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:45,609
enter an environment and take something

331
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:47,319
there's evidence left period right so it

332
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,329
could be a fingerprint it could be blood

333
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:52,540
stain it could be a hair follicle right

334
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:55,929
when it comes to things like information

335
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,519
technology right there could be a CPU

336
00:13:55,929 --> 00:14:00,040
rise there could be increased network

337
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,220
traffic there could be interesting DNS

338
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,709
calls right so there's evidence left you

339
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,369
can't get in and oh without somebody

340
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:12,549
having some traits now the issue is do

341
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:17,679
you have the mechanisms to capture that

342
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:19,660
and then make sense of that right so

343
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,899
threat intelligence so there is a life

344
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:24,850
cycle right so planning indirection

345
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:27,639
you just don't consume intelligence for

346
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:29,259
the sake of intelligence right you want

347
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:33,549
to have a plan what are you doing

348
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:36,459
determine those requirements oops

349
00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:39,069
collection where do you collect now

350
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:41,079
what's interesting here is if you know

351
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:43,269
your network you're gonna know where the

352
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:45,519
best parts are in your environment to

353
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:47,649
collect that data right but if you don't

354
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,189
know it it's gonna be difficult right

355
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:53,160
and everybody does perimeter yes you

356
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:55,959
have IPS but how many people have

357
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,299
security from the campus network into

358
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:59,920
the data center well there'll be some

359
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:02,949
some bigger organizations here I know

360
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,959
have it right but there's a lot of

361
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:06,490
organizations that don't have it what

362
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,109
about what happens when you go to the

363
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,509
cloud it was interesting we were talking

364
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,410
to students today or just before this

365
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:13,779
and they were talking about what about

366
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,660
AWS what what do I need to secure my

367
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:18,429
instance the same thing you need to

368
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,100
secure your stuff on Prem nothing

369
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:23,619
changes right it's just a branch office

370
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,989
if anything right you still need the

371
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:27,009
same controls so you want to know where

372
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:28,779
you're gonna place this where you gonna

373
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:31,029
get that IP fixed data or flow data

374
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:33,809
right where are you gonna put your IDs

375
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:33,809
or IPs

376
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,720
cross processing and exploitation so

377
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:41,670
taking binary data and making it into

378
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,500
something usable for humans right and

379
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:46,140
that would be asking so that's what

380
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,690
you're gonna do in that phase and then

381
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,770
you're gonna analyze and then

382
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,630
productionize it right so that this

383
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:53,870
one's important because there's two

384
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:56,189
components this this relies heavily on

385
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,780
analysts analysts are never gonna go

386
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,000
away for a long time from a security

387
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:02,579
perspective yes we've got really cool

388
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,500
tools that does a lot of stuff but you

389
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,330
still need an analyst to really truly

390
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,190
understand the threat and what it means

391
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:10,950
to the business that you're protecting

392
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:13,080
right you need an analyst to do that

393
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,580
that's not going to go away so don't

394
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,740
worry about the technologies it's just

395
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:19,020
gonna allow you to focus better but

396
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,410
these also have to map back to that

397
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:26,250
planning and direction phase and then

398
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:29,069
you have output right so dissemination

399
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:31,440
and integration so the the actual output

400
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:34,320
of that data that data then is gonna be

401
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,300
potentially share how you share that

402
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,860
data we're gonna talk to about that in a

403
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,260
minute

404
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,570
but again it's got to be something

405
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,100
meaningful right it's got to come back

406
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,930
and this is where evaluation and

407
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,700
feedback comes back it's got to come

408
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:49,829
back to that planning and Direction

409
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,530
phase right why was I doing this in the

410
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:55,880
first place so once you get that

411
00:16:52,530 --> 00:17:00,050
established then we start looking at

412
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:02,700
intelligence so open source information

413
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:05,669
can anybody tell me how you defend

414
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:09,780
against that anybody want to take a

415
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:12,090
crack come on somebody be aware that

416
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:15,270
it's out there right but you can't stop

417
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:19,050
it you could put some controls in place

418
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:21,060
to minimize the amount of data but if I

419
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,440
was gonna compromise an organization I

420
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,060
would want to research it would I

421
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:28,230
research it by doing an nmap scan

422
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:30,570
against their servers no right I go to

423
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:32,570
job boards I'd read about the company a

424
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:36,360
little bit I'd find out oh wait a minute

425
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:39,389
they're hiring they're hiring oh and

426
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:42,240
they need skill sets X Y & Z that's

427
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:44,670
interesting so what do I get from that

428
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,690
two things either they're growing the

429
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:48,070
team or they're short-handed

430
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,080
so not only now do I know the

431
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,369
technologies that they use they don't

432
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,399
have enough people potentially

433
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:59,049
monitoring those logs right good

434
00:17:54,399 --> 00:18:00,820
information I can scan I can have as if

435
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:02,289
I scan them by leveraging things like

436
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,359
Showdown I think somebody mentioned that

437
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:07,149
earlier today right I can look up

438
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:09,489
exploit the databases for exploits that

439
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:12,849
I might finding with the devices that I

440
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:14,979
just discovered and I've done that right

441
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:16,178
so if you look at the city of security

442
00:18:14,979 --> 00:18:18,070
because I thought I'd better not put any

443
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:19,989
real city on here because they might

444
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:23,080
call me afterwards right say hey would

445
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:25,179
you do that but they're building a new

446
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,668
facility which is connected to the city

447
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:29,409
of security Network right so we got this

448
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:31,720
brand-new think public sectors really

449
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:33,700
bad or good at this right because the

450
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,320
problem with public sector in general is

451
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,899
people want to know where their tax

452
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,908
dollars are going so you've got to go oh

453
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:41,379
look at this is what I'm doing right oh

454
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:42,759
sorry

455
00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:45,248
you're gonna have to replace that I

456
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:46,960
think it's broken but you pound the

457
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,489
chest right like I'm so awesome look

458
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,279
what I'm doing 82 million dollars for

459
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:53,109
this section of highway right but if you

460
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,059
go there's a bunch of PR documents that

461
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:57,428
would be released right it'll talk about

462
00:18:55,059 --> 00:19:00,039
who they partnered with what companies

463
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:01,960
are involved right even people to

464
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:03,639
communicate to so maybe I can start

465
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,239
actively taking that open-source

466
00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:09,279
information and start actually probing

467
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:13,179
individuals right and we've seen this in

468
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:16,210
the real world product research and

469
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:17,979
around advisories and alerts right once

470
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,440
I get an advisory or alert then I go

471
00:19:17,979 --> 00:19:22,059
look for things like vulnerabilities and

472
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,919
then I go look up an exploit database

473
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:26,590
and bang I've done I've at this point

474
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:30,340
done all of that without touching the

475
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:32,189
company I've got a plan I know where the

476
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,478
weaknesses maybe they're short-handed

477
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,940
they're expanding their environment

478
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:39,279
right a lot of great information

479
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,590
now again defending against that is

480
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:43,090
tough but knowing is obviously very

481
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:46,629
important right knowing what's out there

482
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:48,939
and you know what me included right when

483
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:50,678
you're on LinkedIn your job description

484
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,019
look what I've done

485
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:57,129
right in my career right so it's

486
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:58,070
everywhere oh wait we got to show that

487
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,929
one right

488
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,790
but that the adversary is getting all

489
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:03,470
that information so as much as you want

490
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:06,200
to put that information out there for

491
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,790
the general community the adversary is

492
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,580
also using that information and

493
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:12,740
potentially against you so we look at

494
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,679
external threat intelligence there's all

495
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,240
kinds of sources right there's ice axe

496
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,850
right there's the Canadian cyber

497
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,520
exchange right I think that's a paid

498
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:24,500
option but I'm not a hundred percent

499
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,170
sand Internet storm center right vendor

500
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:30,050
threat feeds and blogs and you'll get

501
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:31,670
reports etc and this is just an example

502
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:36,350
of some of the intelligence that you

503
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:38,870
might get from a vendor or from a third

504
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:40,969
party whatever right but you're gonna

505
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:43,429
get some IP addresses you're getting it

506
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:45,560
maybe domains files directory hashes in

507
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:46,310
that right so what do you do with this

508
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,240
information

509
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:52,159
who's who's on blue team here la lot so

510
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,450
what do you do do you go and look at

511
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,180
your firewalls to make sure that those

512
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:57,710
are in there right do you ever use this

513
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,750
information to find out whether or not

514
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:02,390
you have systems internally actually

515
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:05,090
making the requests outbound to those

516
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:07,880
destinations or do you go ahead block

517
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:09,740
I'm done right well that's what we see a

518
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,240
lot of right they take that information

519
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,940
they block you said note we're good

520
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,610
we're secure right well in the meantime

521
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,590
assets were already compromised there's

522
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,600
residual there's communication coming

523
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,490
from those devices and yes maybe you

524
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,270
blocked it in the firewall but what did

525
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:27,590
we say earlier those devices are mobile

526
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:29,440
right they just walked outside the

527
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:32,149
environment plugged that in that's

528
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,580
coffee shop right any coffee shop

529
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:36,530
connect to the Internet and now there's

530
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,419
a CNC channel because they're no longer

531
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:41,899
protected by the same mechanisms that

532
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:45,260
you had at the head office right or in

533
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:47,000
the corporate environment internal

534
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,390
threat intelligence how many people

535
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,040
generate internal threat intelligence

536
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:54,770
remember this is taking a step beyond

537
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,899
passive defenses right so now we're

538
00:21:54,770 --> 00:22:00,710
looking at things like endpoint events

539
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,900
we're looking at traffic analysis right

540
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,280
flow data

541
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:07,790
you've probably got lots of it you just

542
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:11,240
got to go turn it on right you might do

543
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:11,730
full packet analysis right DNS analysis

544
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,460
user

545
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:18,510
behavior user information might have

546
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:20,700
honey pots right and maybe you even do

547
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:22,920
reverse engineering around malware right

548
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,530
and again you might be leveraging tools

549
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:28,590
to do that but also the analyst is very

550
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:30,389
important in that equation but a lot of

551
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,399
people don't look at that internal side

552
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,680
they're always looking for threats and

553
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,330
information from from outside but they

554
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,580
need to understand those that that

555
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:41,100
information internally as much as and

556
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,949
even more than what they they they do

557
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,520
externally so it comes to sharing

558
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:49,770
intelligence you may want to classify

559
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:53,520
right so everybody's all about community

560
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:55,410
all about sharing right I've got my own

561
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,690
thoughts about that but but we'll leave

562
00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:00,420
that to the side I think it's a great

563
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:03,270
thing to do right the more we share the

564
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,180
better everyone's protected but you may

565
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:08,190
not be able to share certain information

566
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:09,630
so you want to classify what you're

567
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,310
sharing right so white would be

568
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,950
something that's fine I could share it

569
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:16,350
with anybody right they can use this

570
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,840
information I can use it to share it

571
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:21,389
with similar companies right and it's

572
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,530
good for the community red might mean

573
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:25,190
that you've got some interesting

574
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:27,540
information in there that may expose you

575
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,460
right that you may not want to share

576
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,980
that information out so you want to

577
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:35,070
classify it and then you may want to use

578
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:37,800
a format to be able to share that data

579
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:41,429
to some of your passive technologies

580
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:44,520
right so sticks is the format taxis that

581
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:50,820
the transport to get that data to other

582
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:52,500
platforms asset ID network security

583
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,350
monitoring I think this one's the big

584
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,690
one right not to say any are less

585
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:59,760
important but this this section I focus

586
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,380
on a little bit more and then at the end

587
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,530
I talked a little bit about what you can

588
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,300
do from a manipulation perspective so

589
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,480
how many operations rooms look like that

590
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,430
for security

591
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,370
lie and lying like it you know it hurt

592
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:17,340
didn't it I know it hurt the reality is

593
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:19,560
is that this is you guys do a phenomenal

594
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,870
job it's very hard to do it there's all

595
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,649
kinds of reasons why you might be blind

596
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,050
in somewhere

597
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,760
that's right the bottom line is is the

598
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,620
end-to-end is very difficult and I

599
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:33,270
talked about this earlier how many

600
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:36,689
people could tell me what servers are in

601
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:39,540
their in their data center how many

602
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:44,150
people could say I know it's Windows its

603
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:48,420
Linux its its patch level right

604
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:49,950
application it gets hard right but even

605
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,020
just knowing the systems on your

606
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,400
networks valuable for datacenter

607
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,020
depending on the size of the

608
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:59,160
organization some of you guys might say

609
00:24:55,020 --> 00:25:01,110
yep 192 168 1 dot 0 slash 24 those are

610
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,929
my servers we're all the windows shop we

611
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:07,949
know what's going on ok all right well

612
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:12,570
what about the campus don't say you

613
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:14,160
don't care right because you do because

614
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:16,950
that's probably where the attack is

615
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,650
gonna come from right hopefully you

616
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:22,320
fortified the data center but again

617
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:26,720
nothing's 100% so anyways how many

618
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,720
people can tell me what's on the campus

619
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,080
probably very little right some people

620
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,928
might write depending on the technology

621
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,550
and some people might have a static list

622
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:37,650
to be able to provide that again that's

623
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:39,419
really not good it's like a pen test or

624
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:42,210
a pen test is only as good at the moment

625
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:44,340
that you do the pen test right it struts

626
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:47,309
today it's stretched version to tomorrow

627
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:50,100
right oh and then it struts version 3

628
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:51,690
and it's stripe right so it's only as

629
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:55,770
good as the time it's valuable

630
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:58,429
information you need to do it but it's

631
00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:00,780
it's a little bit static right same with

632
00:25:58,429 --> 00:26:03,150
asset inventory of your environment

633
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:06,059
right it might be a little bit static

634
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:09,929
what about this how many people allow

635
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:12,090
this on their network honestly how many

636
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:14,460
networks can I plug these into and you

637
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:16,439
wouldn't even know it was there right

638
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,200
that's probably the bigger question

639
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,690
because the reality is you might think

640
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,550
that you're ot environment secured go to

641
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:25,530
the lunchroom because somebody brought

642
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:27,570
in their Smart TV plugged it into a

643
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:30,270
network jack that happens to be there

644
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:32,820
that is tied into ot maybe he didn't

645
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:34,290
stop outbound communication from ot it's

646
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,310
got its way into the business that I'm

647
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:37,379
saying this is not

648
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:39,389
right and now they're watching Netflix

649
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:42,840
during the day right during their lunch

650
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:46,710
time right you don't know so how do you

651
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:49,139
protect that turn on all the signatures

652
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:52,350
yeah well now you have a box it doesn't

653
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,090
run right so it's got to be dynamic you

654
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:58,260
got to know what's going on what if you

655
00:26:54,090 --> 00:27:00,389
have CT scanners Oh we'll just throw a a

656
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,470
VE agent on it or malware oh wait the

657
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:05,070
vendor void warranty

658
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:06,390
you can't do that right do you know how

659
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,950
many of those are plugged on are their

660
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,630
mobile are they moving around in the

661
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:11,100
environment being plugged in right

662
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,710
there's all kinds of challenges with

663
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:17,250
trying to secure that and then if you

664
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:18,930
look at a SCADA environment no I I would

665
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,790
say out of every environment this

666
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:25,490
environment you should have locked down

667
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:28,770
and know exactly what's going on right

668
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:32,100
they're fairly static right they don't

669
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:34,860
change as much as you see IT changes but

670
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:38,810
these are all challenges and if you miss

671
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:41,429
one of these right game over right

672
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:44,429
because that's all the adversary has to

673
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:47,210
define is one see as security

674
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:50,370
practitioners you can be batting down

675
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:52,590
hundreds of thousands of threats right

676
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,189
you guys are awesome your team is you're

677
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:56,399
awesome

678
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,780
nobody else gives a right they

679
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,490
don't they don't care how many times

680
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,810
that someone said oh my God look at all

681
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:03,270
the stuff you've blocked this is

682
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:05,399
phenomenal no never

683
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:07,500
you'll never be remembered for it you

684
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:11,460
know you'll be remembered for how you

685
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:13,050
handled the breach right well how'd they

686
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,590
get in well I don't know there's the

687
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:18,300
stupid TV right it's gonna be hard right

688
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,590
to be able to talk intelligently it's

689
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,210
gonna take you a lot of time to figure

690
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,830
out what's going on and you might figure

691
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,470
out what's going on but that's what

692
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:27,210
you're gonna be remembered for and who

693
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,550
are you gonna hire the one that was

694
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:31,680
compromised that made mainstream media

695
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:34,050
as the seaso or somebody that may have

696
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:36,030
handled a breach because nobody not

697
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:37,800
everybody's gonna have to handle one of

698
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,970
these at some point or do you handle

699
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,040
something or you hire somebody that

700
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:43,620
handled the breach well right still go

701
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,290
compromise there was still impact to the

702
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,129
organization but it was done in a timely

703
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,750
manner

704
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,640
they had processes and

705
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:53,580
versus maybe somebody else that's from

706
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,770
compromise and again it doesn't matter

707
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,899
you go for an interview and you say

708
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,720
uh-uh I told them everything nobody

709
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,670
listened to me listen the other person

710
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,080
that didn't have that who do you who do

711
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,760
you hire you probably take the site of

712
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,100
caution right because if you hire the

713
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,480
individual that got breached and and

714
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,820
maybe they did do all the right things

715
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,920
if you get breached again what do people

716
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:17,669
say well would you hire them

717
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:20,310
right so you'll never be remember for

718
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:22,110
how many threats you block or attacks

719
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:25,050
that you block so network security

720
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:27,000
monitoring so you got to start you're

721
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:29,399
gonna want to collect information right

722
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,750
this is why then understanding the

723
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,040
network's important because that's where

724
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:35,130
you're gonna put your choke points or

725
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:38,490
hotspots right places that are important

726
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,720
for you to to capture data and then

727
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,760
you're gonna need tact that right and

728
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,110
that detection is gonna be a variety of

729
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,640
different technologies they could be

730
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:47,040
open source technologies commercial

731
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,060
products doesn't really matter but at

732
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,850
the end of the day you're gonna need

733
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:52,260
things like ids/ips right if you want to

734
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:54,360
do some prevention at the same time you

735
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:57,360
want to baseline the environment if you

736
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,879
could do that you're gonna want to take

737
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,620
flow data maybe you write and then

738
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,060
you're gonna analyze that data and then

739
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,669
there's going to be two results that

740
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:07,129
come out of that one is going to be

741
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,660
you're gonna kick off Incident Response

742
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:11,010
or the other side is it's a false

743
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:14,100
positive we're gonna keep going back

744
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:16,110
through that loop right so network

745
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:19,490
security monitoring collection and

746
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:24,990
detection you've got spam Mirror Mirror

747
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:26,850
ports taps etc right IP fix mention that

748
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,890
but that could be as flow J flow net

749
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:32,040
flow right if you want to talk some

750
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:33,870
brand names firewall event logs window

751
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:36,420
event log sis logs right you may

752
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:39,090
aggravate that data somewhere right but

753
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,830
but this is all going to help you on the

754
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:42,330
the collection side and then the

755
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,409
detection side we talked a little bit

756
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:45,960
about that already right you're gonna

757
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:47,820
have maybe idea ass you'll have you know

758
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,410
maybe ZigBee for some of the wireless

759
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,870
stuff that you might have right you

760
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:53,640
can't forget about that right just

761
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:56,340
because you're capturing data around

762
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,550
Wireless right you're gonna miss

763
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:01,139
anything that talks as igby so again

764
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,700
it's important to truly understand that

765
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,299
environment

766
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:09,409
you might have host ideas flow data we

767
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:11,899
talked about baselines etc so now when

768
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:13,850
you're collected the data you've got

769
00:31:11,899 --> 00:31:15,620
some detection capabilities taking place

770
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:17,750
you're gonna start looking at the

771
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:21,289
analysis portion of it this is where

772
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:23,389
skills come in right human skills right

773
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:25,039
not just technology technology will help

774
00:31:23,389 --> 00:31:27,350
you maybe get rid of some of the noise

775
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:30,980
but at the end of the day you need skill

776
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:33,469
sets so file analysis you have DNS

777
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:37,190
analysis flow analysis packet analysis

778
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:38,570
right time line about analysis right so

779
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,820
we want to understand the timeline of

780
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:44,570
events that took place to be able to

781
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:46,850
correlate that information so we're

782
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:49,580
gonna focus on flow and DNS right these

783
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:51,379
are two examples of many right and how

784
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,658
you can actually start using information

785
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:57,049
to piece together what might be

786
00:31:53,659 --> 00:32:00,710
happening so how many people here can

787
00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:02,510
pick the bad packet out of that right

788
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,730
well I made them read so it makes it

789
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:07,129
easier right but who knows right that's

790
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:09,649
what's on the wire that's encrypted it's

791
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:11,120
even worse right so it's very very

792
00:32:09,649 --> 00:32:13,158
difficult there's all kinds of stuff

793
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,658
happening on your network all day every

794
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:16,760
day right we talked about the little

795
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:18,889
device earlier that they put in line

796
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,570
right the thing I'm starting to think

797
00:32:18,889 --> 00:32:22,969
about how do you mitigate that forget

798
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:25,370
about the the technology that should be

799
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:27,260
mitigated but how can I get that risk

800
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:30,379
from a network perspective potentially

801
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:32,539
right but they're gonna leave

802
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:35,029
potentially evidence right so I want to

803
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:37,399
capture that data and that data could be

804
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:39,019
you know bad Geo's it could be recon it

805
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:41,149
could be compliance things that take

806
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:44,450
place I don't want my business Network

807
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:47,689
directly communicating with the OT

808
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:49,190
environment in lower levels right if if

809
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:53,260
something like that happens I want to

810
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:55,730
know about it you know worm propagation

811
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:59,899
exfiltration all of this you can get

812
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:01,730
from flow right now you might need some

813
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:03,469
technology to help interpret it you

814
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,919
might need an analyst to help interpret

815
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:09,919
it probably get any both right but if we

816
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:13,970
look at it here's a baseline flow right

817
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:15,030
so get a host a tox active directory in

818
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,860
DMS

819
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:22,139
my talk to a print server at god forbid

820
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:26,379
write an email right and then it might

821
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:28,540
talk to the internet and there's gonna

822
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,890
be deviations in that flow right and

823
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,480
you're gonna have some baselines to

824
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:34,330
understand what those deviations look

825
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,430
like right but what if there's an

826
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:39,610
unknown threat when I say unknown I'm

827
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:42,910
saying that our technology's not not

828
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:44,860
Cisco's I'm talking our in general as an

829
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:50,290
industry hasn't been able to identify

830
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:53,949
the threat it's unknown I apologize

831
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:56,290
Russia but I'm gonna use you as the

832
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:58,840
example right but if I had some

833
00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:01,149
communication that's taking place that's

834
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,490
communicating to Russia I was actually

835
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:06,940
in Vancouver yesterday we had an

836
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:08,739
individual and this wasn't part of the

837
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,780
discussion but we did talk about Russia

838
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:13,149
and I said yeah I use it once a while

839
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,040
but I sometimes I try not to because you

840
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:17,409
point out a country and somebody gets

841
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,850
upset and he's like and he's Russian

842
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:22,240
he's gone oh I've went through this

843
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:23,500
ransomware act experience where I called

844
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,719
them up and said I'm Russia they were

845
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,149
willing to give him back the crypto keys

846
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:30,908
because he was Russian but he needed to

847
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:35,859
give us passport and picture and prove

848
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:39,340
he was in Moscow right to get the keys

849
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:43,600
right so he didn't get the keys but he

850
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:46,510
was Russian they sounded Russian but so

851
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,940
host they talked to a server that's

852
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,740
located in Russia we know proxying all

853
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:53,860
that but forget it was just an example

854
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:55,989
but that the line there is a little bit

855
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:57,940
thicker and and what that represents is

856
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:59,080
there's volume of traffic that that is

857
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,660
increased compared to the other

858
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:05,549
communication channels so that's

859
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:11,160
interesting so that took place and now

860
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:13,930
hostei is talking to host B C and D

861
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:16,210
never did before now you might say well

862
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,100
we have a technology that does chatting

863
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,900
and that communications there yeah

864
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,970
based on that protocol right and we

865
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,170
baseline that but this might be a

866
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:25,770
different protocol that's being

867
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:29,609
leveraged right maybe they're expanding

868
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:32,109
and taking advantage of a vulnerability

869
00:35:29,609 --> 00:35:34,840
maybe it's okay maybe they lit up a new

870
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:36,580
service and how many security teams get

871
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,920
involved in that until it's too late

872
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:40,600
right you get brought in oh yeah we're

873
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,400
lighting this up can you secure it yeah

874
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,069
I need a million bucks oh no you're not

875
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:50,010
getting any budget we already spent it

876
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:52,980
okay so now you have host B C and D

877
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:55,119
they're all talking to that same server

878
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,420
would that be interesting to anybody

879
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,250
everybody in the room it would be right

880
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,830
now remember nobody's seeing that

881
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,850
because you're not capturing flow data

882
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,859
so you don't even know what's happening

883
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:08,830
and again it's an unknown threat so it's

884
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:10,420
not like a blacklist at C and C right

885
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:13,119
that it's communicating with we don't

886
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,650
even know yet so anyways that's

887
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,500
interesting so when you look at flow

888
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:19,570
it's five tupple right source IP source

889
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:23,800
port destination IP destination port and

890
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:26,440
then protocol so host a would be an IP

891
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:29,050
address right the source port would be

892
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:32,380
whatever right you got an IP address

893
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:34,660
you've got the destination port an IP

894
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,760
and then the protocol and then now

895
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:38,890
whether you have technology that will

896
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,720
help you through this process or whether

897
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:42,879
you start looking up and doing your own

898
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,680
analysis I can use that flow data and

899
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,810
start building out something important

900
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:51,549
right so that's interesting right now I

901
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:53,529
get start and end time what's that gonna

902
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:55,420
do that's gonna help me know the

903
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:58,869
timeline right of when the events took

904
00:36:55,420 --> 00:37:01,180
place it's valuable right user and

905
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:03,130
device type now this could be stitched

906
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:05,169
into the flow depending on what you're

907
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:07,119
using or you're gonna cross-reference

908
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:09,040
that right because you've got the source

909
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,840
IP address now you're going to DHCP

910
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,790
you're looking at that time line your

911
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,920
cross correlating oh it's that active

912
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:17,980
directory user during that time right a

913
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:21,240
lot of work though right but that flow

914
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:24,760
date is gonna help you move along

915
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:26,020
receive and transmit right so I can get

916
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,450
some interesting stuff from that we'll

917
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,770
talk about that in a second

918
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,419
round-trip time and server response time

919
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:33,310
in this case because it's going to

920
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,900
Russia you probably don't care because

921
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:37,630
your users aren't calling you saying I

922
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:41,109
can't get it taken forever right but if

923
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:42,250
this is an internal flow to a database

924
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:45,100
back-end

925
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:47,740
that return trip time is the network the

926
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,850
entire time from sir or client to server

927
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,850
and everything in between

928
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:53,589
right server response time is telling

929
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:56,200
you how long it took the server to

930
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:58,330
actually respond to the request how many

931
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:01,689
people are here in network and

932
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:04,990
networking couple right how many times

933
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:06,670
is the network the problem I started on

934
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:08,439
the network's wealth systems in the

935
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:10,300
network right but how many times is it

936
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,040
the really the network right very very

937
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,630
Sultan right but it's just black box

938
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,490
nobody knows about so they always say

939
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:17,980
why it's the network go back to check no

940
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:21,069
now I can say the server held it for 200

941
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:22,420
milliseconds I know that right again you

942
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:24,130
might need to other tools to help you

943
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,690
get that information I'm just including

944
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:28,920
it to be comprehensive here

945
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:31,600
URI right that's interesting data

946
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,760
because again destination IP is one

947
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:37,110
thing but if I have the URI now I could

948
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,110
see exactly what they were calling

949
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:43,569
device process so imagine I'm able now

950
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:45,580
to take this information in that time

951
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:47,310
line and correlate it back to the

952
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,540
endpoint to find out what the device

953
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:54,850
process that actually made the call out

954
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:58,330
pal right maybe it was SVC host using NP

955
00:38:54,850 --> 00:39:03,640
authority subsystem that's interesting

956
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:05,650
right shut it down okay so now I've got

957
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,920
potentially data exfiltration I'm gonna

958
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:10,720
help you along right and then we've got

959
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,100
some SMB don't worry about the source

960
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,169
port that could be anything great I

961
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,580
didn't fix this light but because I

962
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:19,120
don't want to say SMB doesn't work that

963
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:20,590
way right but anyways you've got you've

964
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,270
got the same data points right the only

965
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,710
thing different is the protocol and then

966
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:26,200
who it's communicating but you have

967
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:28,210
three of those instances right and you

968
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:31,839
could imagine if this was some type of

969
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:33,940
to a mechanism to propagate right does

970
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,100
anybody know recently what use four four

971
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:37,780
five anybody come on

972
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:42,490
security somebody's got saying don't be

973
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:46,480
shy yeah right eternal blue right

974
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:48,580
being able to propagate using SMB so we

975
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,830
see an SMB probe we don't know what it

976
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:53,610
is right so potentially exfiltration

977
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:55,660
because we see volumes of data right and

978
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:59,050
potentially an SMB

979
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:01,399
so incident response kicks off right

980
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:02,750
your team now is gonna get involved

981
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,099
they're gonna start using this to do

982
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:07,849
their analysis and we're gonna come back

983
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:09,680
to that now when we look at DNS traffic

984
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:14,089
there's some interesting stuff so you've

985
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,020
got this you've got this domain right so

986
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:19,279
you might have gotten this information

987
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:20,839
through third party intelligence right

988
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,150
and again this might be more of an

989
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:25,099
instant response kick off but it doesn't

990
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,859
matter right you're doing analysis and

991
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:29,780
this around DNS so now I know this

992
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:31,848
domain so what I can do is I can do a

993
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:34,700
who is again you might have tools that

994
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:36,770
help accelerate this process or you

995
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:39,649
might be using you know third party

996
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:45,520
tools open source tools go into Google

997
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:48,800
who is right so I've got a domain name

998
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:51,859
what do I need I've got to go quick here

999
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:56,720
41 what do I need in order to register

1000
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:59,869
to me an email address right and then

1001
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,270
it's gonna go on top of of some

1002
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:04,190
infrastructure so if I'm a criminal

1003
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:06,319
organization I probably gonna leverage a

1004
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:08,599
lot of the same stuff right

1005
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:11,240
I'm not because remember I used maybe

1006
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:12,829
fraudulent credit cards to build the

1007
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,779
infrastructure so I'm not gonna do that

1008
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:16,609
every single time so there might be some

1009
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:19,400
commonalities but now I know that that

1010
00:41:16,609 --> 00:41:22,700
individual has had other domains and in

1011
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,859
the past they have been back I can now

1012
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:27,259
pivot from each one of those and I get

1013
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:29,509
what networks they're part of right the

1014
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,700
the maybe some reputation type

1015
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:33,829
information right I can also see the

1016
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:35,990
number of queries so I can actually say

1017
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:37,760
what does a query look like for a

1018
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:39,348
campaign marry that up to what an

1019
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,490
exploit kick campaign might look like

1020
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:45,589
and make a decision right I get IP

1021
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:47,270
addresses from that IP address I get

1022
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:48,650
more to means that potentially are

1023
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:50,839
malicious so you can see where this is

1024
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:52,670
going you've taken one data point and

1025
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:54,799
you've went and blocked it in your

1026
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:58,040
passive defense and you've missed all of

1027
00:41:54,799 --> 00:42:00,349
this right you can actually stay ahead

1028
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:03,140
maybe here right but we started with

1029
00:42:00,349 --> 00:42:04,430
that original domain we've got an IP and

1030
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,460
now we've got three additional domains

1031
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:08,569
so that's interesting so answer response

1032
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:11,280
kicks off

1033
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:14,609
and I'm just gonna fast-track this okay

1034
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,990
so you've got preparation I didn't think

1035
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:17,040
I had enough I thought I was gonna be

1036
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,509
done in like 30 minutes you know when

1037
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,640
you're prepped right there's like wow

1038
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:23,550
I'm in trouble I'm not even and then you

1039
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,560
talk and I like to talk and anyway so

1040
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:27,300
preparation for instant response I kind

1041
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,730
of broke this out for folks that are in

1042
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,770
AI IR right so this is the life cycle

1043
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:33,090
right so you have preparation and again

1044
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:35,030
you guys would get these slides you got

1045
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:38,310
detection and analysis you got

1046
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:40,890
containment great and and I'll eradicate

1047
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:43,080
the threat and then recovery and then

1048
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:45,660
you got post activity right lessons

1049
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,220
learned etc right so that's gonna kick

1050
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,190
off and then in that you're gonna have

1051
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:51,660
chain of command you're gonna have your

1052
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:53,820
incident handlers that are gonna report

1053
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,799
to the lead responder that's gonna give

1054
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:57,990
guidance and timelines and stuff like

1055
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,960
that right they're gonna shield the

1056
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:03,240
handlers from management right we all

1057
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,490
love management but we don't need

1058
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,720
management to be behind the analyst

1059
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:10,080
that's trying to do the work right

1060
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,770
doesn't help and then you have the

1061
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:16,170
director right the director kind of

1062
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:19,380
filters the the entire team from the

1063
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:21,210
business in general but also is probably

1064
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:24,900
point of contact for communications

1065
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:26,339
right and then you've got IR external

1066
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,530
communication so you might have to go

1067
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:32,040
and talk to law enforcement depending on

1068
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:34,680
what the the breach might be internal be

1069
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:39,390
use et cetera so now when you take that

1070
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:41,549
flow now I've got host user insight so

1071
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:44,400
now I know the host and potentially user

1072
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:46,020
behavior I've got an OS device type so

1073
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,810
maybe I know some vulnerabilities exist

1074
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:51,270
on that asset right again I'm painting a

1075
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:53,549
picture here application so now I know I

1076
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:54,960
might know it's vulnerable right maybe

1077
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:56,400
it's process hollowing maybe there's

1078
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,020
additional analysis that has to take

1079
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:06,260
place their IP address and geolocation

1080
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:08,040
domain and full URI ports and protocols

1081
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:11,369
application so maybe we've identified

1082
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:13,890
the app itself and then volume of

1083
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:17,099
traffic right so those are all things

1084
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:19,618
that I could discover from flow when you

1085
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:21,960
look at DNS you can see maybe you've got

1086
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:24,329
some date domains that were

1087
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,220
is bad but as you start painting this

1088
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:29,400
out you might find that hashes are also

1089
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:31,919
assorted associated to that domain right

1090
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:36,089
and as you move along you might find the

1091
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:38,730
download URL you might have domains that

1092
00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:41,130
co-occur what that means is when I go to

1093
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:43,559
your site I might have came from that

1094
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:45,270
site or this site right I might go there

1095
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:47,280
or I might have come from there right

1096
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:49,619
but that might help me tie the attack

1097
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,319
infrastructure together right I get

1098
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:55,980
popped by the exploit kit then I go to

1099
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:57,779
the CNC get the file go finally to get

1100
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:02,880
the corruption keys and get encrypted

1101
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:04,349
right so if we look here we got the

1102
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,069
email address right oh wait I just

1103
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:07,500
skipped that part

1104
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:09,180
goodnight sorry these domains all share

1105
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,270
the same infrastructure these three

1106
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:15,779
folks in the front here right we've got

1107
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:17,550
the email address Rhett registered the

1108
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,260
infection point the current malware

1109
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:21,180
distribution point and then we

1110
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:24,319
potentially can start looking at things

1111
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:26,190
like DJ's and potential future

1112
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:29,970
infrastructure that's gonna be leveraged

1113
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:31,680
against us right so thread emulation of

1114
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:35,308
the environment so this is the final

1115
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:37,290
pieces right is that I'm gonna take this

1116
00:45:35,309 --> 00:45:39,690
information and I'm gonna use it now

1117
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:41,490
right this team's gonna help use it and

1118
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:43,890
and and this is gonna be turned on and

1119
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:47,189
on passive defense potentially as well

1120
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:49,348
right so segmentation of patching so now

1121
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:51,630
I can maybe segment those assets get

1122
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:53,609
them segmented right maybe there's still

1123
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:54,240
some communications let's get them

1124
00:45:53,609 --> 00:45:57,058
patched

1125
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,500
right again this this will be a decision

1126
00:45:57,059 --> 00:45:59,730
right I'm just giving you an idea of

1127
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,460
some of the things that you might the

1128
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:04,349
outcomes might be the device process

1129
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:07,290
maybe I'll blacklist the process if you

1130
00:46:04,349 --> 00:46:09,900
can if it's SVC host you know you're not

1131
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:11,579
you're gonna have to think about what

1132
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,849
you're doing you don't want a blacklist

1133
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:18,030
Explorer dot exe because because that's

1134
00:46:14,849 --> 00:46:20,670
not good right you might patch you have

1135
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:22,859
geo and IP blacklist right blacklist the

1136
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:25,170
domain develop an IPS signature that

1137
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:26,700
matches the URI race and I'm taking that

1138
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:30,540
information building a signature now

1139
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:34,270
mitigating breast blacklist the app rate

1140
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:36,490
restrict the app patching right and

1141
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:38,140
rate limit now in this case if this was

1142
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:39,459
talking to Russia with large volumes

1143
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,830
you're not gonna reek limit right you're

1144
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:43,570
probably gonna cut it off right but

1145
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:45,549
there might be another use case where

1146
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:47,080
you've done your incident response found

1147
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:49,180
out that there's no threat to the

1148
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:52,420
organization but there is a business

1149
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,740
productivity issue and you want to slow

1150
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:56,640
down that access because it's not

1151
00:46:53,740 --> 00:47:01,419
business enhancing that they're doing

1152
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:04,299
SMB probe micro segmentation right both

1153
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:07,930
both sides patching blacklist app

1154
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:10,690
patching restrict app etc the domain I

1155
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:12,609
can block the sender right so I can make

1156
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:14,890
sure that if they ever try to send us

1157
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:16,270
mail right because you remember they're

1158
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:19,420
learning about your environment too

1159
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:22,810
right they're looking to expand maybe I

1160
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:25,900
blocked the sender blacklist the domains

1161
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:29,770
blacklist the IPS I think you guys get

1162
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:31,900
it so your network your system they all

1163
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:33,970
leave evidence right you just got to

1164
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:36,550
figure out a way to capture that and

1165
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:38,350
store it in a meaningful manner that you

1166
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:42,869
can then query at some point in time and

1167
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:42,868
do run analysis on it that's it

1168
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:50,520
