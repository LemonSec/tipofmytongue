jason's uh introduction

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,599
so jason maynard has been architecting

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,440
designing and deploying security

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,440
technologies that secure the most

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,039
complex computing environments

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,239
for almost two decades his understanding

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,800
of technologies

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,760
people and process enable him to deliver

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,239
effective

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,160
comprehensive security solutions that

25
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,680
align to an organization's security

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,798
goals and strategic

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,760
imperative json is adapt at

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,240
addressing a range of risk profile

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,159
across

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,798
industry vertical skills he cultivated

31
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,400
as an end user security practitioner

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,720
partner integrator and now manufacturer

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,920
as senior technical solution architect

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,798
cyber security for cisco system

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,799
json is also active in direct community

36
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,640
speaking at bc aware

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,640
privacy and security conference and

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,840
as i mentioned before he delivered

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,159
sessions uh

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,119
all like you know all all the be like

41
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,079
you know most of the b

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,479
side i think in canada uh jason also

43
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,600
hold like over 75 plus

44
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,520
designations that's a lot man across a

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,158
variety of product and technology

46
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,280
including cci designations

47
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,600
so uh just gonna talk about uh as you

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,640
can

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,079
as you can see on the screen security

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,479
no viruses but the pandemic introduces

51
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,399
new challenges to the security team

52
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,239
so over to you jason

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,520
awesome thanks harv and thanks everyone

54
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,360
um that's uh

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,560
that's organized b-sides you guys do an

56
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,400
amazing job and uh

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,560
kudos to the entire team um yeah so

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,000
this session should be interesting if

59
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,360
you saw my session uh

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,040
last year um you would have seen about

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,680
taking a step back and looking at it

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,440
from

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,120
a different perspective when it comes to

64
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,319
securing your organization

65
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,319
we're going to do a little bit of that

66
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,640
again we're going to build on that

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,440
initial session uh but we're gonna talk

68
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
about some of the

69
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,560
things that we've seen during the

70
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,720
pandemic um

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,400
i know i don't have video i'm actually

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,200
in the rockies i got a thousand

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,519
millisecond

74
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,560
latency link so video's probably only

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,720
gonna uh

76
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,160
hurt me uh at this time but if you want

77
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,040
to have a visual think of me

78
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,079
dressed up in a suit um you know uh all

79
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,599
cleaned up

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,440
i'm not shaving the beard has only

81
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,839
gotten longer um

82
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,040
but in reality i'm still in my pajamas

83
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,120
right

84
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,159
but that's the way it is with uh covet

85
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,280
19 and

86
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,280
and 2020 right

87
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,480
all right so let's talk about the

88
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,879
initial focus so

89
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,720
you know during the pandemic you know

90
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,599
every one of us

91
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,840
that uh drives any type of security

92
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,920
component within any organization

93
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,239
it was all hands on deck right and and

94
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,200
so we were focused on

95
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,000
increasing vpn capacity right and and

96
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,200
that was

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,519
probably the the core of most uh

98
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,560
if you're a networking engineer security

99
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,560
practitioner

100
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,799
didn't really matter it was really

101
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,480
trying to keep businesses alive right

102
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,760
people had to work from home and we

103
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,159
needed to start

104
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,760
leveraging and adopting you know some of

105
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,040
the traditional methods that we use

106
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,079
today

107
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,079
and uh vpn was a big part of that

108
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,720
and a lot of it was centered around vpn

109
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,080
licensing and increased capacity so we

110
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,840
work on that head end

111
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,360
and we'd ensure that we've had enough

112
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,560
capacity required

113
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,799
to satisfy the need problem was

114
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,159
is that after we did that other

115
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,840
supporting infrastructure

116
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,159
started to fail right and um and that

117
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,478
could

118
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,680
connections per second on on switch

119
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,959
infrastructure

120
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,479
uh firewalls etc but

121
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,960
we've never built uh the vpn

122
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,440
to to be able to run the entire business

123
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,280
on right it wasn't

124
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,680
at the forefront it was always there

125
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,159
just in case for a pandemic

126
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,520
but it was really meant to augment

127
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,600
certain users that

128
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,960
that needed the capacity to work away

129
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,520
from the office

130
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,359
not to run the entire business on and so

131
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,960
we struggled and that over subscription

132
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,639
could have been internet circuits

133
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,799
could have been like i said switching

134
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,040
infrastructure

135
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,880
and then and then what we did was we in

136
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,160
order to satisfy this and again this

137
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,040
sets the framework

138
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,639
of why we want to take a step back is

139
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,400
that we started saying well wait a

140
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,199
minute maybe we need to offload some

141
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,719
capacity

142
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,479
and and so this is where we start

143
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,639
introducing things like split tunneling

144
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,800
right we start saying you know what

145
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,039
things like sas based services if we

146
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,440
have office 365 in the cloud should we

147
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,199
back

148
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,199
all that through a vpn connection just

149
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,520
to go back out to the internet

150
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,320
um what about things like netflix can we

151
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,198
control

152
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,000
users accessing those resources and

153
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,080
again the burden

154
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,600
that it would put on our infrastructure

155
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,919
if we were to pass it through

156
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,120
that vpn tunnel and so we started

157
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,159
shifting some of those

158
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,880
applications um to go direct

159
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,120
or not even come through that internet

160
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,800
or that vpn connectivity

161
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,800
obviously there's challenges when we

162
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,400
start doing that

163
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,000
and then what we did was we started

164
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,880
adding web services

165
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,720
right so we said well wait a minute some

166
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,639
users don't even need

167
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,080
vpn connectivity what they need is

168
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,880
access to this

169
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,479
specific application and so we may have

170
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,520
introduced that to

171
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,960
the internet and use native tls

172
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,359
as a security wrapper to give access to

173
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,198
certain individuals to these services

174
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,880
and then we extend that beyond that

175
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,639
right we we start looking at

176
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,080
um sas right uh we may have already had

177
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,680
some things in in

178
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,960
in the cloud already um the other thing

179
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,800
is this may have

180
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,799
forced you to move things faster so you

181
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,199
might have had a hybrid

182
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,880
exchange environment right with uh

183
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,120
office 365

184
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,400
in the cloud and and so it may have

185
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,840
pushed you to move

186
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,039
faster to adopt that full cloud-based

187
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,080
capability

188
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,318
or sas based capability and then what

189
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,719
we've done is we've increased

190
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,800
you know the amount of users that aren't

191
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,479
really used to working from home

192
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,479
right i mean i've been working from home

193
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,719
i think over a decade now

194
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,479
um but um you know there's a lot of

195
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,080
people that don't outside of i.t

196
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,840
right i.t may have had more of that

197
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,800
flexibility

198
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,239
but the the average user used to go into

199
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,160
a brick and mortar

200
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,360
type facility and and do their

201
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,160
day-to-day

202
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,039
uh job um and now we've said here's a

203
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,440
laptop

204
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,318
go home and don't come back right and

205
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,880
and connect

206
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,560
and and so we've exposed them to an

207
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,440
environment that they weren't they were

208
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,240
not used to

209
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,800
right and and they're always used to you

210
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,360
know

211
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,039
when they connect in inside the

212
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,560
organization there's some security

213
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,039
controls that are in place

214
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,759
and so they probably don't realize it

215
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,360
but there

216
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,080
there's things to make sure that they're

217
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,240
safe that may not be in play when you

218
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,400
work from home

219
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,960
and so security right what about

220
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,039
security in all of this right

221
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,400
is there an issue is is there a concern

222
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,039
we've done a good job of

223
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,159
giving people access quite honestly it's

224
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,400
the biggest

225
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:55,520
proof of concept i believe in it

226
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,120
ever right ever we've

227
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,840
forced the entire world almost to say

228
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,400
get out of the office and work from home

229
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,840
and use

230
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,840
technologies uh that

231
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,080
you know some users haven't used before

232
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,400
at a capacity that we've never seen so

233
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,080
it's

234
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,039
been a a tremendous trial and i think it

235
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,000
has

236
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,479
tremendous impact on how we move forward

237
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
right

238
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,560
and you've got to think about this what

239
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,199
about covet 2 like phase 2 what happens

240
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,599
in the fall

241
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,240
right do we users have to be sent home

242
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,400
again

243
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,599
right do we have the capacity and and

244
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,079
that right if

245
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,399
if it has to increase but not only that

246
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,560
many organizations i believe

247
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,120
are going to realize that this work from

248
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:42,399
home model actually works

249
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,880
and if it works then do i need to to

250
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,000
have brick and mortar right or as much

251
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,680
of it right

252
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,120
and i think the commercial space could

253
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,560
be in trouble

254
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:56,399
um uh you know moving forward right

255
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:59,119
because of this so don't believe me

256
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,959
um security is is a real problem

257
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,440
especially from work from home so what

258
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,839
i've done

259
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,920
is i've went to you know cyber security

260
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,959
infrastructure security agency

261
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,279
like cisa and and i i just looked for

262
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,399
you know elements around covid and work

263
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,279
from home

264
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,160
um and i found there's no shortage of

265
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,480
threats out there

266
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,760
actually we we're seeing an increase in

267
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,399
in threads

268
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,360
and so again here's one that talks about

269
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,160
covet 19

270
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,920
loan relief web page and phishing emails

271
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,839
right so the threat actor is

272
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:35,279
is using covid19 to get people to bite

273
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,000
right you've got you know hopefully this

274
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,279
doesn't happen

275
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,800
today um but uh you've got uh you know

276
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,920
all this video conferencing type

277
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,000
technology

278
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,079
um and and you've got to consider you

279
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,600
know if somebody jumps into a meeting

280
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,200
that shouldn't be in a meeting is it

281
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,560
secure and encrypted

282
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,399
these are all things that we may not

283
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,760
have thought about originally when we

284
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,760
started onboarding some of our

285
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,560
capabilities right we were so much in a

286
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,959
rush

287
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,518
to get the capability in play that we

288
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,119
haven't actually taken a step back

289
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,200
and really looked at the threat

290
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,040
landscape right and what it means from

291
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,360
work from home

292
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,079
malicious activity targeting covid19

293
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,920
research

294
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,279
vaccine development so there's a big

295
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,680
push to be first

296
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,439
right and so you've got to think any of

297
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,199
these organizations that are doing

298
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,079
research around vaccine development

299
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,160
development

300
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,079
are certainly at higher risk at this

301
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,120
point in time right whether it be state

302
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,160
sponsored

303
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,480
or other doesn't really matter

304
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,800
the threat is real right people want to

305
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,640
be first or countries want to be first

306
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,920
with vaccine development so either

307
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,319
they're going to steal

308
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,000
intellectual data or what they're going

309
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,560
to do is

310
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,920
compromise the data that you have so the

311
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,839
outcomes

312
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,680
may not be the outcomes that that you

313
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,920
would have seen because there was some

314
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,040
compromise somewhere

315
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,560
ddos attacks are have increased by

316
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,240
500 percent uh again because of covet

317
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,560
one of the elements we've got to think

318
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,240
about is is that i don't now have to

319
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,839
worry about just disrupting your

320
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,440
internet as an adversary

321
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,360
disrupting your internet would cause

322
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,040
issues right normally it would

323
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,640
anything going to the internet would be

324
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,560
at risk right but

325
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,000
usually when you're in a brick and

326
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,839
mortar type facility

327
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,839
all of your resources are usually

328
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,519
accessible still right it's usually not

329
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,600
going over that same internet circuit

330
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,440
it's either back hauled internally or

331
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,560
through a dedicated circuit of some

332
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,640
some sort and so internally i have full

333
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,719
operations my teams continue to

334
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,079
function yes there might be some

335
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,959
disruption but it's not

336
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,000
massive now i have to target all i have

337
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,239
to do is target

338
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,680
vpn head ends as an example or some

339
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,839
web-based service that

340
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,760
that you're having your users leverage

341
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,839
to continue operations

342
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,760
i just have to target that so it could

343
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,920
be a volumetric attack

344
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,800
right which means i could you know shift

345
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,160
traffic

346
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,680
to the internet and scrub it or it could

347
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,199
be more service impacting

348
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,680
focusing on you know a certain service

349
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,000
that you're offering and try to impact

350
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,399
that

351
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,480
service and not worry about trying to

352
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,360
saturate your your uplinks but it

353
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,959
becomes a tremendous problem with vpn

354
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,279
and here's another alert around

355
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,119
enterprise vpn security

356
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,800
and again it just talks a little bit

357
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,560
about um

358
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,399
you know some of the elements here right

359
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,479
as organizations use vpn

360
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,600
right more vulnerabilities exist the

361
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,000
adversary has adjusted its tactics

362
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,360
it's um it gets a little bit more

363
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,480
difficult around

364
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,360
patching right because vpn becomes you

365
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,800
know 100

366
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,399
reliable or and so

367
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,880
you know when do you keep the patch

368
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,480
updates now for your vpn

369
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,800
you've got phishing emails that are

370
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,639
targeting teleworkers again stealing

371
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,719
usernames and passwords if i can get

372
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,040
your vpn username and password there's

373
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,240
likelihood that i i'll have full access

374
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,560
into the organization

375
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,680
right and so you might say well not my

376
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,680
organization

377
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,439
you'd still be restricted based on that

378
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,479
that user identity

379
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,880
um but many organizations may not right

380
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,079
again it depends on how fast you move to

381
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,320
get these users

382
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,439
uh onboarded uh so they can work from

383
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,279
home

384
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,120
and then we've got things like you know

385
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,040
multi-factor authentication if we're not

386
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,200
using it we're more susceptible to

387
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,360
phishing attacks right

388
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,560
and um obviously i mentioned this one

389
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,200
already around

390
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,079
you know the vpn head end becomes a very

391
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,279
critical service to keep operations up

392
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,120
business operations up that is

393
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,320
and then another one here again it just

394
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,959
kind of walks through

395
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,639
a little bit and using covid now as the

396
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,399
theme as the lure right

397
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,160
so now you've got fishing that's got

398
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,079
coven 19

399
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,079
elements wrapped around it you've got

400
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,279
malware distribution points

401
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,560
uh domains obviously have coronavirus or

402
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,920
kova 19

403
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,560
names in them now um and again

404
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,439
um they they continue to target and

405
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,839
here's a couple of

406
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,639
examples right where malicious android

407
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,120
app

408
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,720
um provides real-time coronavirus

409
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,360
outbreak tracker right that sounds

410
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,959
usable

411
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,000
usable right that's something that i

412
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:13,040
might want but instead it downloads

413
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,600
uh you know it and gives the uh

414
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,519
administrative access to install covet

415
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,440
lock on on this particular device so

416
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,399
it's ransomware for the device

417
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,079
but as a normal user you know i'm

418
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,519
thinking that this application is going

419
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,800
to help me right

420
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,120
especially during the pandemic and and

421
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,240
and to be quite honest many users

422
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,600
including myself

423
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,920
this is where we're going to get our

424
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,240
information we're going out to the

425
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,639
internet and trying to understand what

426
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,399
covid19 and coronavirus what it looks

427
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,600
like in our neighborhoods what we can do

428
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,680
to minimize

429
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,680
you know our risk and this one here

430
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,359
it was it definitely hits home right

431
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,399
this is in canada

432
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,680
where um you know we've seen a shift

433
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,639
where

434
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,719
the adversary is so clever right is that

435
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,639
wait a minute what about if i tell the

436
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,199
user that their account has been

437
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,240
breached and i'm here to help them

438
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:11,839
right so now they're using the

439
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,120
the aftermath of a breach as a way to

440
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,519
entice you

441
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,199
to maybe click on something or provide

442
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,079
some information

443
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,479
and this one here actually hits home for

444
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,319
me

445
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,880
specifically because i i know somebody

446
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,680
very close to me that actually had this

447
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,680
happen

448
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,040
and this is where you know august 15th

449
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,079
the canadian government announced that

450
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,040
5500

451
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,920
uh cra accounts were compromised and

452
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,599
they used the

453
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,120
credential stuffing attack so basically

454
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,759
what they did was

455
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,120
they went and logged or they breached

456
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,199
and got credentials

457
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,920
through other breaches and used those

458
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,959
those credentials to log into

459
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,439
cra they logged into cra they changed

460
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,439
the

461
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,040
direct deposit information of the

462
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,000
accounts and

463
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,719
then they applied for covet 19 whatever

464
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,199
relief

465
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,399
uh you know things that are available to

466
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,479
canadians

467
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,440
and had that money deposited into that

468
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,320
account

469
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,920
uh and then got out of there right so so

470
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,120
it's real right um

471
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,920
work from home and the pandemic has

472
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,480
definitely

473
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,160
increased our overall uh risk profile

474
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,759
so we're gonna take a step back as i

475
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,040
mentioned right we're going to look at

476
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,079
this

477
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,800
based on a a use case and we're going to

478
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,079
look at it

479
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,758
from what security wrappers do we think

480
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,239
are required this isn't

481
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,199
vendor technology this is capabilities

482
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,040
right

483
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,880
so we'll look at the internet use case

484
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,160
don't look as when you see the flows

485
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,320
don't look

486
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,560
the the cloud is just meaning that this

487
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,880
is the flow that we're looking at

488
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,719
but uh the internet use case will

489
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,600
include users going directly to internet

490
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,279
or split tunneling

491
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,680
um oh went the wrong way here sorry

492
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,519
the next one will be sas use case right

493
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,479
include users going directly to sas

494
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,319
based services using native tls

495
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,559
typically and then you've got vpn use

496
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,639
cases right and now this is where you're

497
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,240
terminating to a vpn headed as an

498
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,280
example and so we want to think about

499
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,839
things like phishing

500
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,439
and malware but also you know

501
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,280
prevention's awesome

502
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,559
the reality is no matter what

503
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,399
technologies you have

504
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,399
how well you cobble them together

505
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,799
the adversary is going to win at times

506
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,799
and so you've got to think about the

507
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,360
other side of the equation right

508
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,080
do i have the data do i have the

509
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,320
information

510
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,439
i need to be able to determine what

511
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,080
actually took place

512
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,280
and ultimately build in mechanisms to

513
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:44,480
defeat the adversary moving forward

514
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,039
system hygiene right ddos direct

515
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,679
internet

516
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,440
social engineering dns outage right

517
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,760
split tunneling now dns

518
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,559
outage is interesting right because you

519
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,200
don't think of how critical dns becomes

520
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:00,399
when you start using sas based services

521
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,600
right if i can't resolve can i still

522
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,880
get to office 365

523
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,760
so who you use or what you use for dns

524
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,080
now becomes

525
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,919
something that you want to consider

526
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,678
obviously inside you would do that you

527
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,360
most likely have your own infrastructure

528
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,360
that supports this

529
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,918
but now they're working from home it may

530
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,439
not even be vpned in directly into the

531
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,760
organization

532
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,080
credential theft and we can go on right

533
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,640
we've talked about many of them

534
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,639
and so this is where i build this out

535
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,960
right so now we look at an endpoint and

536
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,440
we

537
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,039
we we we have a user and they're going

538
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,640
to connect and and we're going to build

539
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,400
out these flows together

540
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,640
well it's really going to be me you're

541
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,440
going to be listening hopefully

542
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,080
um but um we'll look at it from two

543
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,919
lenses

544
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,120
right i thought about this at first and

545
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,880
i thought you know what i would break

546
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,159
these up because you've got a prevention

547
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,480
capability

548
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,960
and then you have a detect and respond

549
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,559
capability and and so what i've done is

550
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,720
you know if you can prevent something

551
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,080
that's great right detection well you've

552
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,960
already prevented it so you had to

553
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,960
attack

554
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,240
and response well you blocked it right

555
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,480
so there is already

556
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,640
somewhat of an inherent response there

557
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,039
because you prevented the attack

558
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,919
um but i break them up and we'll walk

559
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,919
through this together

560
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,640
we've got uh patching right system

561
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,799
hygiene

562
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,679
it's still a big thing right if we can

563
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,240
patch 100

564
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,960
of everything we'd be in really good

565
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,320
shape

566
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,760
but you got to think about that work

567
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,120
from home user right how are you

568
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,039
patching those systems

569
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,879
right how are you keeping them updated

570
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,400
right are you using some management

571
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,480
platform internally

572
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,960
using some type of tls mechanism to

573
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,799
secure it are you doing it through a vpn

574
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,320
connection when they connect but what

575
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,000
happens if they don't connect

576
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,159
what if it's 10 days that they don't

577
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,600
connect because they used a sas based

578
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,360
service and there wasn't a need to

579
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,760
connect to the vpn right so these are

580
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,320
things that we want to think about

581
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,799
exploit prevention right so now we get

582
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,799
into

583
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,080
defending your endpoints for from things

584
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,160
like memory injection

585
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,080
right and these attacks are commonly

586
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,240
seen with malware and zero day and they

587
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,918
attack unpatched software

588
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,840
and then you get into system protection

589
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,039
process right so we want to make sure

590
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,678
that those system

591
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,760
processes are not being attacked by

592
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,320
other processes on the system

593
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,760
and again this is focused on capability

594
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,360
right i'm not saying this is a

595
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,039
technology that you need

596
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,520
it's just the capability that you've got

597
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,320
to consider

598
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,559
advanced malware and av right that's

599
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,760
obviously commonplace nowadays

600
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,360
but you want to make sure that you're

601
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,600
using something with multi-engine

602
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,479
platform or multi-intelligence platform

603
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,080
right that has

604
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,559
different insights into the threat

605
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,399
landscape and hopefully different ways

606
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,039
of detecting whether or not something

607
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,120
malicious is happening

608
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,158
malicious activity protection so what

609
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,120
happens if

610
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,559
as an example something does pass your

611
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,719
defensive capabilities

612
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,158
right we know that that's a reality it's

613
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,000
going to happen

614
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,120
and what if it starts encrypting the

615
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,960
drive just starts to do it right

616
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,280
do you have a mechanism maybe to stop

617
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,240
that particular process that's invoking

618
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,440
something that

619
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:11,520
you deem as malicious right

620
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,520
so these are again things to consider

621
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,159
application blocking so again you might

622
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,520
want to make sure that certain

623
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,080
applications aren't uh

624
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,840
able to operate on on a mobile endpoint

625
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,559
right no matter where they are

626
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,879
um but but the other use case and i've

627
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,678
worked with someone recently on this one

628
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,039
is what happens if you have to let

629
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,760
somebody go

630
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,120
um right and um and they're not coming

631
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,879
back to the office

632
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,639
necessarily right and so they've got to

633
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,640
ship the laptop but from

634
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,919
the point of when they ship the laptop

635
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,280
to when you receive it

636
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,200
you're worried about whether or not

637
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,600
there's some localized data on the asset

638
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,320
now

639
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,240
nobody wants localized data but do you

640
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,000
have controls in place to

641
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,400
mitigate against that that that would be

642
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,480
a question so you can use something like

643
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,159
app blocking to do something clever

644
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,840
right right so say there was a

645
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,919
termination that took place

646
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,559
um obviously you shut down all the

647
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,320
access internally vpns active directory

648
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,480
all that magical stuff

649
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,840
um but i can also maybe build a policy

650
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,360
that says

651
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,918
block explorer.exe from launching

652
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,879
right and so if the user uses the laptop

653
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,760
and flips it up

654
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,960
it gets the update um they try to log in

655
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,158
uh there's no shell

656
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,840
right the the asset becomes unusable

657
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,520
at that point in time so again being

658
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,520
clever with the technologies that you

659
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,639
have

660
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:36,320
network blocking so the ability to

661
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,120
you know block you know l3 l4 type

662
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,200
controls right and again this doesn't

663
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,439
always necessarily have to be on the end

664
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,640
point this could be anywhere else

665
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,240
but the thing the way i you know some

666
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,039
people argue defense in depth

667
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,559
whether it's dead or alive i do believe

668
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,400
that if you have multiple controls in

669
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:58,000
multiple different layers

670
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:01,280
your success of either

671
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,559
defending or making it so

672
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,399
um uh so um difficult for the adversary

673
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,720
to be successful that they move on

674
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,720
right and so you know you want to look

675
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,440
at this as a multi-prong approach for

676
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,000
sure

677
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,480
usb blocking so this becomes another

678
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,039
issue

679
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,280
right maybe not an issue that we thought

680
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,000
was a big deal when they're on premise

681
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,799
but now off

682
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,760
premise you know we've got students from

683
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,400
from home

684
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,879
right and so people are scrambling to

685
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,000
get their

686
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,280
children asked access to laptops and

687
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,520
devices and

688
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,280
and so maybe you know they're using

689
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,960
their work laptop even if policy

690
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,559
suggests otherwise

691
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,760
you know people tend to you know

692
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,480
again want to help their family members

693
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,240
and and

694
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,360
they don't suspect anything risky is

695
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,640
going to happen because they don't know

696
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,959
computers

697
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,400
and so a student comes in or the family

698
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,039
member that's a student comes in and

699
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,039
plugs in the usb device opens up a pdf

700
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,640
the pdf has malware on it right

701
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,640
and so you might want to have some

702
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,440
controls there to force

703
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,159
the data to be in a file repository in

704
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,880
the cloud

705
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:10,000
maybe or on premise as opposed to coming

706
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,919
in through external devices

707
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,919
intrusion prevention i think that's

708
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,400
commonplace firewalling

709
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,440
right so you got network blocking based

710
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,559
on l4

711
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,320
l3 l4 based on um maybe

712
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,918
you get some security intelligence to

713
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,639
suggest something's bad and so you just

714
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,559
don't want to

715
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,480
communicate outbound and then you've got

716
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,240
you know standard-based firewalling

717
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,400
that might be built into the system

718
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,360
itself or through a you know

719
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,559
an application that you've purchased you

720
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,799
get fileless

721
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,720
uh malware right so this is where we get

722
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:44,480
into um

723
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:47,360
you know again taking advantage of

724
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,520
uh memory and injection and running code

725
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,279
and memory and evading and so

726
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,520
exploit prevention and system protection

727
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,080
process those are some elements that are

728
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,158
going to

729
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,720
help you here but we've got to consider

730
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,159
file lists as well

731
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,760
and then you get into you know some more

732
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,440
of the buzz buzz terms right

733
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:08,000
uh ai and uh machine learning so

734
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,520
machine learning is a subset of ai uh

735
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,840
but machine learning you've got to have

736
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,960
a lot of good data and a lot of bad data

737
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,120
in order for those

738
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,400
algorithms to really mature but it's

739
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,959
something you want to consider

740
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,640
right on the end point and so that kind

741
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,919
of rounds out prevention and somebody

742
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,520
might have their hand up saying well

743
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,039
wait what about what

744
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,799
yes there could be more there could be

745
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,720
less right um

746
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,840
but you get the idea really taking that

747
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,360
step back

748
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,439
i haven't even talked about what i'm

749
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,039
connecting to yet i'm just talking

750
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,960
at the end point at this point these are

751
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,400
some of the things that i would consider

752
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,600
these are things that i've been talking

753
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,919
to people about

754
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,439
over the last you know probably five

755
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,559
months uh

756
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,720
ever since covid really started and then

757
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,600
now we move into detect and respond

758
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,039
right so now you

759
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,719
you know buzz terms like endpoint

760
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,559
detection and response right

761
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,960
the ability to understand that a word uh

762
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,279
document was opened by windward and it

763
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,799
executed a macro the macro then

764
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:08,720
reached into powershell and reached out

765
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,440
to a ip address pulled down a dropper

766
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,840
file

767
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,799
yada yada right the story of what

768
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,840
happened

769
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,440
um tremendously valuable especially now

770
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,320
that you don't have access to these

771
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,000
resources

772
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,360
as much as you did before when they were

773
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,919
on premise

774
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,840
forensic snapshot right i need to be

775
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,840
able to take a snapshot of that endpoint

776
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,279
at any point if there's an incident

777
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,959
can i do that what if they're not

778
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,320
connected to a vpn

779
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,000
what if they have direct connection to

780
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,720
an internet can i

781
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,480
can i get the data i need again this

782
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,720
could be a very big

783
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,600
breach right and i need some additional

784
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,679
insight and maybe it all started here

785
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,039
um and so i need some insight from that

786
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,279
endpoint

787
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,960
host isolation right the ability to be

788
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,520
able to minimize

789
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,880
the overall risk of that endpoint if it

790
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,960
was compromised

791
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,880
right so once you determine it has been

792
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,679
compromised what do you do

793
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,919
right okay so maybe you have edr maybe

794
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,039
you can take a forensic snapshot

795
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:10,000
but can i isolate the house and still um

796
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,440
you know do my investigation let it have

797
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,799
limited access

798
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,039
right so these are things that we want

799
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,440
to consider because vpn isn't going to

800
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:20,240
always be there

801
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,799
cloud-based ioc so again enhancing the

802
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,919
technol

803
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,440
or the intelligent stack that you have

804
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,600
and again based on certain activities

805
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,440
and patterns you might have to flag

806
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,918
indications of compromise now this

807
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,159
doesn't necessarily have to be cloud

808
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,120
but i see the trend moving towards more

809
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,720
of that big

810
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:41,120
data you know uh data

811
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,799
uh intelligence you know that that

812
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,639
typically comes from the cloud

813
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,120
uh because it's too big to build on

814
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,840
premise

815
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,959
command line capture again if if power

816
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,360
shell's going to be

817
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,960
invoked i i don't only want to know that

818
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,039
power shell was invoked

819
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,720
i want to know that it was power cat

820
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,919
minus c

821
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,440
[Music]

822
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:04,399
4.4.4.4 minus

823
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,320
you know p444 right i want to know the

824
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,239
exact command line

825
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,799
that was or you're using powershell to

826
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,679
download a file and start the process

827
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,360
i need to know what that command line um

828
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,960
that was passed within that

829
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,199
that application that was used or

830
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,360
processed that was used

831
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,120
you've got sandboxing and file analysis

832
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,039
now i didn't put this as a prevention

833
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,678
capability because i feel that

834
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:30,559
sandboxing takes a bit of time to do

835
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,120
and in order to do that um you can't

836
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,360
stop

837
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,639
an http connection mid-stream and say

838
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,199
give me seven to

839
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,279
you know five minutes or five to seven

840
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,799
minutes to execute this payload in the

841
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,720
sandbox environment come out with a

842
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,879
disposition and update you late

843
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,640
right before you can you just can't do

844
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,159
that it's impossible

845
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,720
um and so um i see this more of an after

846
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,279
uh thought so it may have been sandboxed

847
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,880
right

848
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,559
then you've got to think about okay now

849
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,240
you know the disposition is bad how does

850
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,279
it tell the end point about the

851
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,360
disposition

852
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,799
and what does it do with it but also i

853
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,000
need this to be able to do my own

854
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,080
analysis right

855
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,440
if i need to submit a file or review a

856
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,279
file that was submitted

857
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,960
i want to know what registry entries

858
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:15,120
network connections i want

859
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,480
you know p caps i want um you know

860
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,320
what behavioral indicators were

861
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,200
triggered i need to know all of that

862
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,200
right to help

863
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,320
understand the full context of the

864
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,320
threat that i'm dealing with

865
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,000
and then we move into vulnerable

866
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,600
software right you can't be successful

867
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,480
at patching unless you identify the

868
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,120
vulnerable

869
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,360
uh software sure you can do it regular

870
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,959
every tuesday right patch tuesday

871
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,559
but there's other software that might be

872
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,279
on the system that needs to be patched

873
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,120
as well and

874
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,960
and i want to be able to tie vulnerable

875
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,840
software to any breach that might have

876
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,480
happened

877
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,240
that's key to me right because if if i

878
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,320
can mitigate the vulnerability i

879
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,720
essentially break the the adversary's

880
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,039
ability to be successful

881
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,559
but if i can't tie the threat to the

882
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:00,080
vulnerability

883
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:02,320
um or the breach to the vulnerability

884
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,720
then it's just going to continue to to

885
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,320
happen

886
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,520
ipfix or or network flow data right from

887
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,320
from an endpoint where it ties in the

888
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,158
process

889
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,678
to the network connectivity that it's

890
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,279
making and so

891
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,559
some of you might be sitting on the edge

892
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,000
of your chair say well wait a minute

893
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,158
isn't that what endpoint detection

894
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,360
response does

895
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:27,360
kinda right it does but it's usually

896
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,199
limited to the number of flows per

897
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,959
application that it that it actually

898
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,840
tracks what i'm talking about here

899
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,200
is every single application or process

900
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,158
that makes a network connection

901
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,559
regardless

902
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,600
of any threat is actually being

903
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,600
monitored and tracked

904
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,600
all right now we've got the end point

905
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,039
right some people might be saying well

906
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,439
the endpoint would never run if it had

907
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,520
all this stuff on it right but

908
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,480
you certainly can do that in today's

909
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,200
world right

910
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,320
agents are becoming uh thinner and and

911
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,399
streamlined

912
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,439
um there's some things here you can use

913
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:03,279
uh you know a couple of products with

914
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,720
some are inherently built into the

915
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,960
operating system

916
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,640
just have to expose it and then others

917
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,080
might be you know based on

918
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,559
vendors that you that you might deal

919
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,799
with right but you want to look at that

920
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:18,320
both from a prevention and detection

921
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:21,039
and response perspective so

922
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,399
cool but before we even connect any

923
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,679
services there's some other things that

924
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:27,439
we want to consider

925
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:29,760
like dns security right again i told you

926
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,760
earlier that now your vpn head end or

927
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,720
your sas based services

928
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,279
all of these dns records that you

929
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,279
leverage

930
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,399
have to resolve and if they don't

931
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:45,200
resolve then that service will be down

932
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,080
disrupting your users so dns security

933
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,559
becomes not

934
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,600
only the an ability to make sure that

935
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:53,279
you can resolve

936
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,719
services but also a mechanism to prevent

937
00:31:53,279 --> 00:32:00,320
threats right dns is a first-line

938
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,399
capability when it comes to breaches

939
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,399
right dns has to happen before i make a

940
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,279
connection and so it gives me an

941
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,840
opportunity

942
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:12,480
to cut it off sooner in the attack chain

943
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,519
web proxy right you might want to have

944
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,159
proxy why

945
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,039
well now you want to run additional

946
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,919
inspections

947
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,360
against that payload if you're waiting

948
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,880
for the end point

949
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,039
to catch it because you might be saying

950
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,080
well wait a minute you know

951
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,120
you could say dlp tls decryption and

952
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,199
advanced malware

953
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,120
wait a minute i have that here right

954
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,600
like so why do i

955
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,559
need it here right it's going to see it

956
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,559
here

957
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,799
i'm a big believer that if you wait for

958
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,720
the end point to solve the problem

959
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,879
right just to solve the breach it's

960
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,799
always too late

961
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,320
in my mind that's not where you want to

962
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,799
defend right

963
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,320
now you have to defend there that's a

964
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,918
reality

965
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,678
because you can't trust the other

966
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,279
controls that you have elsewhere are

967
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,640
going to be a hundred percent every

968
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,480
single time

969
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,120
and so you need something at the end

970
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,519
point but if i had it in my mind where i

971
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,360
wanted to defend i want to defend as far

972
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,480
away from the asset i'm protecting as

973
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,000
possible

974
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,600
and so web proxy allows us now to do dlp

975
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,360
we can start thinking about tls

976
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:20,320
decryption it's more specifically around

977
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,000
um you know tls 1.3 and some of the

978
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,320
implications that are caused

979
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,880
there around decryption and then i could

980
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,320
do advanced malware inspection

981
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,000
and then i transitioned from the

982
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,600
prevention side to

983
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,760
okay what are the other things that i

984
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,719
would would require

985
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,480
so thinking about this is dns forensics

986
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,440
right that this becomes tremendously

987
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,000
valuable

988
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,880
again determining not only about what

989
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,960
took place

990
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,159
but also maybe understanding the attack

991
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,679
infrastructure right

992
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,720
that that that is being leveraged so dns

993
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,000
forensics becomes

994
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,840
highly critical full uri capture so if

995
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,159
you are doing proxy or the need for

996
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,120
proxy exists

997
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,799
again having that full uri is certainly

998
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,360
helpful

999
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,480
sandbox and file analysis it's a proxy

1000
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,520
connection

1001
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,040
and so if you've got a sandbox it's http

1002
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,320
you can't keep that connection open

1003
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,480
forever

1004
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,480
and so uh you know you've got to do the

1005
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,839
sandbox and file analysis very much the

1006
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,760
same as what we talked about on the

1007
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:23,199
endpoint

1008
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,040
and now we move into the internet

1009
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,918
connectivity right and so this internet

1010
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,759
connectivity

1011
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,319
might be a little bit more open here

1012
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,040
right because they're not coming to

1013
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,000
a vpn head end or a sas based service

1014
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,320
now in this case

1015
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,679
i'm showing email like it would be a sas

1016
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,159
based service

1017
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,879
and and i'm not really focused on that

1018
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,679
side of it

1019
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,839
um today but you also have to look at

1020
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,720
that if this is web conferencing as an

1021
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,799
example

1022
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,879
you've got to think about is it is it

1023
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,720
secure is it encrypted where does the

1024
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,399
data reside like these are all things

1025
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,040
you got to think about on the services

1026
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,759
side

1027
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,440
especially if you're exposing it like

1028
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,359
you've never done before

1029
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,960
and i used email as an example here and

1030
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,560
i'll continue that theme

1031
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,240
moving forward so we only have to walk

1032
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,759
through this once

1033
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:13,200
but you've got reputation filtering

1034
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:16,240
right spam business email compromise

1035
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,640
advanced malware protection again right

1036
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,160
like

1037
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,920
you might be saying well wait a minute

1038
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,399
it's already here right

1039
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,359
well yes but if i can block the

1040
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,520
attachment from

1041
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,040
ever the user clicking on it i want to

1042
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,280
do that right and so

1043
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,320
here's an opportunity for me to extend

1044
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,200
that capability

1045
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,040
here and prevent much sooner in the

1046
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,598
attack chain

1047
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,759
gray mail phishing right anybody that's

1048
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,000
done anything around email security

1049
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,920
um you know knows these are fairly

1050
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,960
common capabilities that that would

1051
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,000
exist today in

1052
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,560
any mature email security offering and

1053
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,440
so

1054
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,040
url protection is another one and so

1055
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,040
some people and i've heard this

1056
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,800
this comment uh you know talking with

1057
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,440
many people across the west

1058
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,680
is why do i need url protection here at

1059
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,720
the email level because when i click it

1060
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,598
isn't that dns going to do a dns lookup

1061
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,240
and then i got this web proxy capability

1062
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,720
you're right

1063
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,680
it does right but if i can actually

1064
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,680
defang it

1065
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,279
in an email so nobody clicks on it i

1066
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,440
don't have to worry about whether their

1067
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,480
dns security had intelligence to know it

1068
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,040
was bad

1069
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,920
right i was already able to to mitigate

1070
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,640
that risk

1071
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,599
or maybe i redirect that that maybe for

1072
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,759
proxy as an example

1073
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,480
you've got sandboxing now you notice i

1074
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,800
didn't say sandboxing and file analysis

1075
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,760
i've left file analysis both for detect

1076
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,520
and respond

1077
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,280
sandboxing i included here is a

1078
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,320
prevention capability

1079
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,960
because the email is never

1080
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,880
you know instant you have an opportunity

1081
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,240
here to hold email for a little bit

1082
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,160
longer

1083
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,439
and therefore you could run it through a

1084
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:56,799
sandbox get the disposition back

1085
00:36:53,440 --> 00:37:01,359
before um before

1086
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,359
you ever send it to the user itself

1087
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,320
dlp right and then you get into some of

1088
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,040
the forensic pieces right the detect and

1089
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,560
respond

1090
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,079
right message tracking i want to know

1091
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,078
everything about the message file

1092
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:16,000
analysis right i want to know behavioral

1093
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,000
indicators again it's more of the same

1094
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,240
so that's email right on the services

1095
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,000
side so we won't do that again

1096
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,319
although the theme will carry for vpn

1097
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,640
and sas right but you get the idea of

1098
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,800
the process that you want to go through

1099
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,400
uh when you're building out your overall

1100
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,560
security posture

1101
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,760
and you have the opportunity to do this

1102
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,599
right um

1103
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,359
now this isn't too late you might say

1104
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,320
well we've already got things employed

1105
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,520
great figure out what you need figure

1106
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,520
out where the gaps are

1107
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,119
and address them right there is an

1108
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,240
opportunity still

1109
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,560
to make the organization more secure

1110
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,000
so now we get into vpn right again this

1111
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,759
is not a termination point

1112
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,520
right so don't say well shouldn't this

1113
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,119
be here right

1114
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,640
no it doesn't matter this is the flow

1115
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,560
right you've got all kinds of different

1116
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,359
controls wherever

1117
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,359
so ddos right again now we know it might

1118
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,240
not be volumetric type attacks

1119
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:11,040
although they still exist and you can

1120
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:15,040
use scrubbing stations etc to be able to

1121
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:17,839
you know offload that volumetric

1122
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,640
attack into the cloud as an example but

1123
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,920
now you've got

1124
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:24,879
service focused impacting um

1125
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,040
ddos capabilities and now they're trying

1126
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,800
to take down your vpn service

1127
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,480
why because they know that now you're

1128
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,320
going to be running you know maybe

1129
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,440
you're running at 80

1130
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,040
um from work from home i could drop that

1131
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,680
down where it's very difficult for you

1132
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,680
to operate

1133
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,359
tls decryption again if i'm doing a

1134
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,760
network based inspection here right

1135
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,839
again i need to do tls decryption right

1136
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,720
or else malware and ips all of that

1137
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,839
stuff becomes

1138
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,520
i i'm blind to it right and again i know

1139
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,839
some might be sitting there saying well

1140
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:01,119
tls here it's open here

1141
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:04,480
tls here tls here lots of t yes there is

1142
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,359
again i want to prevent you know as far

1143
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,320
away from the

1144
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:10,240
the the individual i'm protecting and so

1145
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,240
if i have an opportunity to block

1146
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,359
advanced malware here even if this was

1147
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,959
going to catch it

1148
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:20,240
i want it blocked here again

1149
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:23,359
if this fails i need this capability

1150
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,319
to hopefully catch it and again the the

1151
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,200
green stuff right

1152
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,920
all this stuff here is key in case you

1153
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,399
do get breached

1154
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,880
all right so you got multi-factor

1155
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,960
authentication you got endpoint posture

1156
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,640
right geo control you might not think

1157
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,640
that that's much of a control

1158
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,319
but it certainly is something that

1159
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,279
layers on the complexity that the

1160
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,119
adversary

1161
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,000
has to overcome right they've gotten out

1162
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,320
proxy and take other methods

1163
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,240
you've got l7 firewalls right now we're

1164
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,920
getting into application control and

1165
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,000
again that might be shifted to an

1166
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,760
endpoint right or in the cloud

1167
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,400
um but it could be a network-based

1168
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,599
device as well that's more traditional

1169
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,960
you have ips you have advanced malware

1170
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,200
inspection

1171
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,880
behavioral based policy like the ability

1172
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,640
to be able to understand

1173
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,480
that this is a critical asset it's

1174
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,799
talking to a critical resource

1175
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,119
i have this software version on it and

1176
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,680
there's an indication of compromise

1177
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,839
right so i may be on all those factors

1178
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,480
want this to be a certain impact level

1179
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,799
so i can

1180
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,200
actually address it then you get into

1181
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,440
web application firewalling

1182
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,640
you got device insight denied

1183
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,839
authentications

1184
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:36,480
right host profiling impact analysis

1185
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,720
sandbox and file analysis right so

1186
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,880
impacts analysis and host profiling

1187
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,720
are key and the reason why they're key

1188
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,079
is is that if you don't understand the

1189
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,839
asset you're protecting

1190
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,680
how do you understand the impact of the

1191
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,279
threat that's coming in and so those two

1192
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,720
work together right but these are things

1193
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,319
that you want to consider

1194
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,839
whether you use it in the platform

1195
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,119
that's being offered or you try to

1196
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,480
figure out a mechanism to do it

1197
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,319
externally

1198
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,599
vulnerability insight again if i know

1199
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,759
the vulnerabilities that are being

1200
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,839
targeted i can get them patched

1201
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,480
in the meantime maybe use ips signatures

1202
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,279
to minimize my risk here you got flow

1203
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,560
analytics

1204
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,560
event packet capture

1205
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,160
um and then um and then you've got

1206
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,279
event workflow right so this is the

1207
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,680
ability to pivot

1208
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,800
and understand what the threat looks

1209
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,359
holistically

1210
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,200
right from end to end ultimately and

1211
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:28,240
then you get into the application

1212
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,040
right and again so sas space there's a

1213
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,240
couple here

1214
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,960
i'm going to move because i'm already

1215
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,520
getting the 10 minute warning

1216
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,599
so multi-factor authentication right for

1217
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,520
sas based service right we'd also want

1218
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,880
multi-factor as i mentioned for vpn

1219
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,680
right or any other service that we're

1220
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,680
offering

1221
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,839
the more critical the service obviously

1222
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,040
the the more critical multi-factor

1223
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,560
becomes

1224
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,920
endpoint posture i want to understand

1225
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,440
the end point right before it's

1226
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,160
connecting to that sas base

1227
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,880
geocontrol we've already covered that

1228
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,359
you've got

1229
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,960
restrict non-sanction applications right

1230
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,799
so applications that

1231
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,560
exist for example if you have one drive

1232
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,480
and that's your file repository what

1233
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,880
about dropbox box and all the other file

1234
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,319
repositories the user can still get to

1235
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,520
remember they're not plugged into the

1236
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,279
network and they're not going through

1237
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,880
maybe a next-gen firewall that's doing

1238
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,640
application control

1239
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,000
right they might be driving this because

1240
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,759
they're they're directly

1241
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,359
connected to the internet and using that

1242
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,359
sas based service

1243
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:23,279
so we want to make sure that those data

1244
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:27,040
that data is not being moved over

1245
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,839
you've got sas based dlp as well

1246
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,400
and then you get into device insight

1247
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,319
denied

1248
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,839
authentications right i want to know if

1249
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,359
multi-factor fails

1250
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,279
then there's a good indication that a

1251
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,240
credential was stolen right because they

1252
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,680
got to the second

1253
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:43,759
factor and it failed shadow i.t and

1254
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,680
community trust rating so the ability to

1255
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,960
understand the applications my users are

1256
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,319
using in the cloud and

1257
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,680
figure out whether or not these are

1258
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:51,680
should be moved to sanctioned

1259
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,078
applications

1260
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,160
user identity behavior analytics if i

1261
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,640
log in in edmonton to salesforce and

1262
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,118
then

1263
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:04,319
an hour later i log into um

1264
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,400
uh uh office 365

1265
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,359
from maybe the continent of africa or

1266
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,119
whatever right

1267
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:11,279
if i've logged in there i can't be in

1268
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,960
those two places uh very quickly and so

1269
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,319
i need something to tie that together to

1270
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,760
let me know that that actually took

1271
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,040
place

1272
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,800
and there's risk and then you have the

1273
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,920
service at the end right so whatever it

1274
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,359
is email

1275
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,280
web uh some web type

1276
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:27,119
platform doesn't really matter

1277
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,800
salesforce etc right you've got to think

1278
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,079
about the security wrappers for that

1279
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,119
application as well

1280
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,480
not only within the app right as

1281
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,400
tanya was mentioning right the

1282
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,000
applications need to be secure but also

1283
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,400
anything that's supporting around that

1284
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,160
application right as well

1285
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,680
and so this is now what you end up with

1286
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,598
right so this looks a little bit more

1287
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,879
interesting now i have a better picture

1288
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,480
of what i need

1289
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,400
and now i need to figure out what are

1290
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,760
the controls or what are the

1291
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,880
technologies that are going to help

1292
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,920
satisfy these

1293
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,640
these needs but it doesn't stop there

1294
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,520
right i think that's understanding the

1295
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,480
controls

1296
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,800
and the the the the ability to detect

1297
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,200
and respond in case of failure

1298
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,720
of those controls but then we've got to

1299
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,520
think about what happens in instant

1300
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,359
response

1301
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,640
and threat hunting that that user might

1302
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,480
be mobile right it's

1303
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,400
they're not connected they're they're

1304
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,079
directly connected to the internet and

1305
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,240
maybe not vpned in

1306
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:23,680
so how do i hunt right for threats

1307
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,919
and so you know lots of people are

1308
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,040
building data lakes data lakes are very

1309
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,800
expensive to do

1310
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,880
and i'm not saying you shouldn't do it

1311
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,119
but if you're not down that path

1312
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,960
um what you want to be able to do is

1313
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,760
hopefully leverage some api based

1314
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,599
platform

1315
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,400
that can actually query the technologies

1316
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,400
you own and provide you insight

1317
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,000
and hopefully visuals of what that

1318
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,839
threat looks end to end

1319
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,200
right so i should be able to say i know

1320
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:50,078
that this is bad

1321
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,118
this is a an indicator it's a shaw an ip

1322
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,839
whatever

1323
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:55,440
ask the platform questions and it tells

1324
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:57,680
me i've saw it in an email

1325
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,839
attachment with this subject i've seen a

1326
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,078
dns request go to this domain

1327
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,759
and i've saw something on the endpoint

1328
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,560
and i'd like that all tied together and

1329
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,000
show the relationships between them

1330
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:11,119
and then you've got orchestration and

1331
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,240
automation so the ability to be able to

1332
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:16,000
um orchestrate and automate um some of

1333
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,560
this right so building out playbooks

1334
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,760
becomes

1335
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,960
key right and and and even if you

1336
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,960
haven't done this and i've got an

1337
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:26,319
example here that you guys can see

1338
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,880
in the um the pdf version that i'll

1339
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:29,440
share

1340
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:32,079
with b-sides later but it walks through

1341
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,640
going through in the incident response

1342
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,240
um consortium and you know you grab

1343
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,680
fishing and you walk through fishing you

1344
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,598
build out the playbooks that's

1345
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,359
meaningful for your organization

1346
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,280
but you got to think how can i automate

1347
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,200
some of this stuff like if i see a

1348
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,200
fishing link come in

1349
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,279
wouldn't it be cool if i can say okay

1350
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,118
abstract those observations

1351
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,800
query the rest of my technologies tell

1352
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,240
me the results of all of that

1353
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:58,960
based on my environment right

1354
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,520
and also then take a forensic snapshot

1355
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:05,040
move the asset into isolation

1356
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,800
uh create a conference room with the

1357
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,400
right incident responders so they can

1358
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,480
collaborate

1359
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,839
and potentially take action right

1360
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,800
additional action

1361
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:16,720
on that threat and so maybe that's for

1362
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,960
some a longer term strategy

1363
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,279
but that when you're building out these

1364
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,640
you have to be thinking of these as well

1365
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,240
and then you've got threat intelligence

1366
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,920
that's going to support all of this

1367
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,640
right whether that be third party

1368
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,520
in-house

1369
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,759
outsourced doesn't really matter the

1370
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,520
intelligence comes in and so can i use

1371
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,000
these platforms to be able to

1372
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,000
feed that new information into to

1373
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,160
provide prevention capabilities

1374
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,760
and then also be able to query that data

1375
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:46,640
as needed for instant response

1376
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,839
and so i'm coming up to the end here

1377
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,160
i've included this

1378
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,359
just to be complete here so i'm not

1379
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,200
going to walk through it

1380
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:58,480
in full but if you're not aware of irc

1381
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:02,160
not irc chat right but irc is

1382
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,920
the incident uh response consortium um

1383
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,000
check it out right they've got tons and

1384
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,200
tons of community-based uh playbooks

1385
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,839
that have been developed

1386
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,439
and you can grab them download them and

1387
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:13,279
modify them right there's no

1388
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,280
no restrictions that i've seen and i've

1389
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,119
worked with a lot of organizations that

1390
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,640
universities as an example

1391
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:22,079
that certainly leverage uh this this

1392
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,160
this site to help build out some of

1393
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,920
their playbooks and so

1394
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,359
you got to prepare right you got to get

1395
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,760
the right teams together

1396
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,960
you've got to review a maintain a

1397
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,480
timeline and you might have some

1398
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,079
interviews and you're going to have some

1399
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,119
you know an internal path and your

1400
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,720
document that an external path

1401
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,160
then you're going to get into detect

1402
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,759
right so what is it that we're

1403
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,920
actually looking for what are the threat

1404
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,559
indicators right we need to understand

1405
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,319
those

1406
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,000
and then kind of develop them right like

1407
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,880
emails that are non-re

1408
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,319
uh returnable or non-deliverable right

1409
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,000
or

1410
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,680
emails that have been linked to an

1411
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,240
external or unknown url

1412
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,319
right and so these are my indicators and

1413
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:03,200
i need to categorize those

1414
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:04,400
requests maybe packet capture conduct

1415
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,160
content scans

1416
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,920
now think about these elements too when

1417
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,879
you're doing the playbook

1418
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,280
are these manual can you automate this

1419
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,040
right

1420
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,880
these are things that i would want to do

1421
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,119
right i don't want my team focused on

1422
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,119
trying to capture and pull all the data

1423
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,440
right they're too smart for that i want

1424
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,200
my team focused on analyzing the

1425
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,119
having the human element right let the

1426
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,078
technology do all the weeding out of all

1427
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,319
the noise

1428
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,000
but i need my humans to be able to look

1429
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,759
at it understand the context of the

1430
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,520
threat based on the business

1431
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,960
and be able to come to the determination

1432
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,640
to understand the risk to my

1433
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,960
organization

1434
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,078
analyze it right we need to then define

1435
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,319
the risk factors

1436
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:45,680
right log collection evidence collection

1437
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,680
data capture etc

1438
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,720
then we move into contain we want to

1439
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,799
contain it right so how we gonna do that

1440
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,919
right servers desktops our credentials

1441
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,520
stolen

1442
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,680
right uh what other services are

1443
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,200
impacted again here's a nice

1444
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,200
list of elements that you want to

1445
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,720
consider almost done

1446
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:07,759
harv uh eradicate um

1447
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:10,480
triage uh and confirm incident uh

1448
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:13,280
a report right um and ultimately

1449
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,280
eradicate the malware that's the goal

1450
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,359
um and then recover recover those

1451
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,680
systems incident remediation

1452
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:21,119
and this one here post incident handling

1453
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,720
although the others are very important

1454
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,119
this one i think is critical

1455
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,759
right it's at the end everything's been

1456
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,760
done

1457
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,440
now you need to go back and revisit

1458
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,520
right and learn from that

1459
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,680
um make sure that you're applying those

1460
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,079
lessons and and you're adapting your

1461
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:39,279
your processes to accommodate the things

1462
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,200
that you've learned during that incident

1463
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,400
and so again you've got to think about

1464
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,960
the use case

1465
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,559
what you're trying to secure um and

1466
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,400
build that out with a longer term

1467
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,839
strategy in mind right you might not be

1468
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,680
able to get there day one

1469
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:53,920
but you want to build towards something

1470
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,839
and building it out based on flow

1471
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:59,280
is going to help you identify what you

1472
00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:02,640
require in order to be successful

1473
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:05,839
and that's it and yes

1474
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:10,640
it's anonymous but i i like it oh yeah

1475
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:10,640
awesome presentation again you nailed it

1476
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:16,240
um thank you for that um so uh i have

1477
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:18,640
one question

1478
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,520
from the audience um the question is

1479
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,040
this

1480
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:26,079
for work from home during covid 19 times

1481
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,680
what is the best strategy tips for

1482
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,079
security awareness training

1483
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,399
for end users who are already under

1484
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,400
stress

1485
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:42,319
so so sorry say that again harv i

1486
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,240
i kind so so users are under stress

1487
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:46,960
they're already working from home yeah

1488
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,919
what's the best strategy for uh security

1489
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,760
awareness training

1490
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,000
like you know who's uh already under

1491
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:55,839
stress working from home user

1492
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,839
so that's the question

1493
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,759
so restraining yeah i'm sorry i'm i'm

1494
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:04,960
i'm missing the security awareness

1495
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:08,000
strategy security oh sorry i got it

1496
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:11,359
gotcha it could be that latency on my

1497
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,680
side hurt um yeah so i i i think

1498
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,040
security awareness training is key right

1499
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,359
that's more than ever

1500
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,640
um because uh again many of these users

1501
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:20,319
aren't used to it so

1502
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,319
there's lots of different platforms out

1503
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:25,279
there that'll actually go through

1504
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:25,839
uh and grade them and test them and it's

1505
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,920
not

1506
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,960
they don't feel like they're being um

1507
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,960
you know uh

1508
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,480
graded in the sense like in school right

1509
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,440
it's almost more

1510
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,880
like playful type uh training exercises

1511
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,359
that you can go through

1512
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,559
right um and it's not something like

1513
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,480
