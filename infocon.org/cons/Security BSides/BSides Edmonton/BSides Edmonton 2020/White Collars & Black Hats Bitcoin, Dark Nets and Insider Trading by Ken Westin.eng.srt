1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:08,069
so today I'm gonna be talking about

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,590
black hats and white collars this is

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:11,910
some research that I did really looking

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,370
through a lot of actual criminal

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,049
complaint documents it's actually I

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,279
found that there those documents are

7
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,410
actually really great for threat

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,359
intelligence you can actually start to

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,070
learn a lot about you know folks that

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,680
are criminal hackers what they're using

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,119
for infrastructure and things like that

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,279
in this particular topic I found really

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,170
interesting because we always talk about

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,480
how much money that hackers can make you

15
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,640
know doing stolen credit cards things

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,680
like that but there's actually a lot

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,239
more money to be made when you're

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,670
actually looking at doing stock trades

19
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,500
and things like that and I'll kind of

20
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,149
walk through you know how they actually

21
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,329
conducted some of those particular

22
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,899
breaches about me I'm based in Portland

23
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,850
Oregon I work for a company called spunk

24
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:56,789
it's kind of my dream job I get access

25
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,170
to large sets of data and I get to do

26
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,989
all sorts of fun things I teach

27
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,359
workshops around threat hunting how to

28
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,280
go and actually find adversaries in your

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,920
environment when you're your automated

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,140
boundary defenses fail I'm also very

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,400
interested in insider threat at our user

32
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,049
conference I'll actually be talking

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,290
about how to leverage machine learning

34
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,759
for looking at insider threats so if you

35
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,970
guys are coming to comp if you're a

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,700
Splunk customer i'll see you there but

37
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,320
prior to my work at Splunk i actually

38
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,780
developed various tools to help track

39
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,600
stolen devices and when I did that I

40
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,329
actually ended up also unveiling large

41
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,189
organized crime rings a stolen laptop

42
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,309
for example would basically function as

43
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,750
a Trojan into various Russian organized

44
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,420
crime groups that were in Portland for

45
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,700
example and so I learned a lot about

46
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,740
sort of investigative theory and process

47
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,630
around that worked really closely with

48
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,298
the FBI law enforcement a lot of those

49
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,280
investigations so the cool thing is I've

50
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,770
actually put people in data all right

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,350
sorry in jail with data right so that's

52
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,729
that's kind of where I've done a lot of

53
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,259
presentations around this I actually

54
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,240
presented it at Def Con around so that

55
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,619
topic as well but I really kind of go

56
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,350
down rabbit holes I look at particular

57
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,788
types of attacks and I try to unveil how

58
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:13,540
the attackers actually went about and

59
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:15,328
their crimes so why are this topic I

60
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,250
think this is really interesting because

61
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:21,189
it's involves criminal hacking it also

62
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,599
involves fraud insider trading insider

63
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:23,858
threat I'm going to go through a lot of

64
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:26,078
these different cases and you'll see all

65
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:27,609
these different components sometimes we

66
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,829
think of securities you know your

67
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:31,540
boundary defenses your firewalls and

68
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:32,970
things like that but what I found is

69
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,870
particularly when you're conducting

70
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,280
investigations a lot of times you have

71
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,200
to bring in other different types of

72
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,639
data sources you may even need to get

73
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,670
data sources from another service

74
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:45,790
provider we'll see that with this some

75
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,349
one of the breaches where a PR firm like

76
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,638
at newswire they didn't actually protect

77
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:51,488
their information they didn't have the

78
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,530
right logs in place so the FBI when they

79
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:55,510
came in to ask for those logs they

80
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,299
didn't have them and that made the

81
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,500
investigation quite a bit difficult so a

82
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:01,269
lot of times when you're talking about

83
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,040
the data that you need it's not always

84
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:05,709
just for your immediate investigations

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,150
they might be required for other types

86
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:11,349
of investigations depending on your

87
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:13,120
industry yeah this also involves some

88
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:15,129
things around using darknets and tor

89
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,510
there's a lot of international things

90
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:18,879
that happen I actually found a lot of

91
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,519
collaboration with hackers that are in

92
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,260
the UK in Ukraine and Russia actually

93
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,849
collaborating with white-collar

94
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,340
criminals and actually people that are

95
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:29,918
one guy was actually a VP at Morgan

96
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,690
Stanley and he was actually leveraging

97
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,129
some of the these hackers to actually go

98
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,590
out and do some of this dirty work and

99
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:38,858
I'll talk about how those guys met as

100
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:41,049
well and this type of attack is really

101
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:42,819
difficult to detect you'll see in a lot

102
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:44,699
of these cases the reason these guys got

103
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:47,679
caught is because they got greedy

104
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,840
they're arrogant or someone just made a

105
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,889
stupid mistake and I think when if you

106
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,810
actually look at some of these I think

107
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:55,269
there's a lot more of this going on than

108
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,680
we would like to admit the SEC is

109
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:58,629
involved in some of this and even the

110
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,000
SEC themselves have been hacked and I'll

111
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:02,228
talk about that as well but there's a

112
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,060
lot of money fee made and I think

113
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:05,739
there's are a lot of money being made as

114
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,209
a result of these types of compromise

115
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:09,250
and I'm still conducting additional

116
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,720
research I'm actually in some of dark

117
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,799
net forums where I'm actually looking at

118
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,870
some of these folks that are actually

119
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,030
trading this information I'm hoping to

120
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:20,649
unveil some of that at blackhat next

121
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:22,179
year so we always think about you know

122
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,150
who's targeting an organization I always

123
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,790
like to you know think of

124
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,109
you know the tools toxic and procedures

125
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:29,180
depending on our industry right we we

126
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,620
can look at hey if we are intellectual

127
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,080
property that's going to be a target of

128
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,550
an organization if we have credit cards

129
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,469
if we have customer information that can

130
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,120
be sold know that that's all your

131
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,770
valuable information for a hacker so

132
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,300
when we start to do our threat modeling

133
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,370
it should be around that based on our

134
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,660
industry but there's other types of

135
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,970
information if you're a publicly traded

136
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,370
company and you have earnings reports

137
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,750
that data can be incredibly valuable to

138
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,190
the right people who know how to make

139
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,889
money off of it and you'll see that in

140
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:57,160
our example one group actually generated

141
00:04:54,889 --> 00:05:00,080
over a hundred million dollars in trades

142
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,150
the SEC was able to get recover about 53

143
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,820
million of that so one guy in particular

144
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,198
he's going to jail for 20 years but for

145
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,349
about four or five years he lived a

146
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,970
pretty good life so it's always good to

147
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,229
think about this and your log sources

148
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,310
and things like that the data sources

149
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,990
that you actually have in your

150
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,580
environment and you'll see in a lot of

151
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,030
cases you need more than just firewalls

152
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,198
and VPN things like that a lot of times

153
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,030
very sophisticated malware can be put on

154
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:31,490
system so you're gonna need really high

155
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:34,010
fidelity logs from your endpoint so I

156
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,300
found actually a lot of folks in the

157
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,860
financial industry are actually becoming

158
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,380
really interested in cryptocurrency

159
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,909
right especially a Bitcoin and things

160
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,370
like that they're actually trading on

161
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:44,960
this themselves and with that what's

162
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,190
happened is a lot of these folks have

163
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,198
become a little bit more technical

164
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,610
technically savvy they're actually

165
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,680
leveraging tor they're going into

166
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,389
darknet forums and they're actually

167
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,180
meeting hackers right so what's

168
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:58,430
happening is these guys have really good

169
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,750
knowledge around finance they know how

170
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,919
to do white-collar crime and they're

171
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,229
meeting with these hackers who have

172
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:04,609
really nice technical jobs so what

173
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:06,889
happens is you they're paying the

174
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,300
hackers to go out and you know hack some

175
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:10,729
of these systems and get access to some

176
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,260
of this information and then the they're

177
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:14,300
giving that information to the traders

178
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,580
and the traders are ours are just giving

179
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,560
them straight-up Bitcoin for that is

180
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,090
really difficult to trace or in some

181
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,590
cases they're even setting up trading

182
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,810
accounts for those hackers so that they

183
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,489
can make money as well and you'll see

184
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,870
that in these guys it's one case in

185
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,070
particular they got a really really

186
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,090
greedy and that's really how they got

187
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,880
caught because there was a lot of

188
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,919
irregularities that were being detected

189
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,870
I really like to show billions so talks

190
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,780
a lot about this kind of stuff right how

191
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,490
to get some of the information

192
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,679
if you guys have ever watched the show I

193
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,210
like Paul Giamatti too but they do talk

194
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,190
about some of these types of scenarios

195
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:47,280
as well and it's just amazing how much

196
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:49,560
money these folks can actually make so

197
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,969
the definition of insider trading so

198
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,590
it's the illegal practice of trading on

199
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,000
stock exchange to one's own advantage

200
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:57,330
through having access to confidential

201
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,950
confidential information it's a little

202
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,870
bit deeper than that too what's

203
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:03,380
interesting is that when we start

204
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,430
looking at hackers accessing information

205
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,669
it's a little bit different because it

206
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,350
actually doesn't it originally wasn't

207
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:11,789
actually classified as insider trading

208
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:14,310
they actually developed a term called

209
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,930
outsider trading because a hacker who I

210
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,030
exact access to information does not

211
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,830
have a fiduciary duty around that

212
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,409
information right he's not an officer he

213
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:24,060
doesn't he's not a maybe a family member

214
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,560
of someone who might have access to some

215
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,020
of that information right they're

216
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,910
actually conducting crimes so a lot of

217
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,200
times folks will actually get sentenced

218
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,669
for crime but they won't get sentenced

219
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,979
insider trading but there was actually a

220
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:38,039
change that was made when one of these

221
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:40,830
cases actually came to light so this is

222
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,479
the sec versus a fellow named dora zoko

223
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,659
and i'm gonna totally brutal i it's

224
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:49,140
ukraine ukrainian and russian names so I

225
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,419
apologize in advance this fellow he was

226
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,400
a hacker there was some interesting

227
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:56,549
things that happened he actually was

228
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,200
trading with this particular trading

229
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:02,190
company they're called Interactive

230
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,780
Brokers he put about 42,000 dollars in

231
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,870
there and they made around almost three

232
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:10,200
hundred thousand dollars in one trade he

233
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,760
was really not too smart because that he

234
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,520
just opened that account and this was

235
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,020
his first transaction right and of

236
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,849
course that's gonna throw some red flags

237
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,380
his account got suspended while the

238
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:23,280
Interactive Brokers conducted the

239
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:25,440
investigation and contacted the SEC so

240
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,820
it's actually happening is that he was

241
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,400
doing reconnaissance he was actually

242
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,990
targeting one particular company and a

243
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,789
lot of times when companies would they

244
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,080
have to announce their earnings they

245
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,490
would provide this information to

246
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,460
Thompson financial they would have

247
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,830
slides excuse me this would be maybe a

248
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,870
day or so in advance they would have

249
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,280
this system all set up and then they

250
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,600
would actually conduct the presentation

251
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,699
and then of course you know the stock

252
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,310
price would change as a result of that

253
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,880
every report so he was doing some

254
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,380
industry

255
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,080
reconnaissance he was able to actually

256
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,960
do a brute force the credentials of a

257
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,250
particular person from this one company

258
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,590
he was then able to intrude at around

259
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,090
2:15 and he was actually exfiltrating

260
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,870
that earnings and the non-public

261
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:08,760
information so what happened was again

262
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,490
this IMS health incorporated a company

263
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,890
they published that information to this

264
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,630
particular server and he was waiting for

265
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,620
it he got access to it he knew what

266
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,960
folder it was going to be in what

267
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,580
directory and so he just sat there and

268
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,350
he waited he kept looking for it kept

269
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,910
looking for it and then when it actually

270
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,500
got landed he pulled the data down and

271
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,910
then that's where we actually see that

272
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:32,400
he was conducting his trades and that's

273
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:34,110
how he got he got busted so summary

274
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,300
judgment he had to pay back that money

275
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,010
plus the interest right he actually

276
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,459
never appeared in court because you know

277
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:43,290
he's in the Ukraine he did not move

278
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,820
future Guinea to the source of the

279
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,949
information or those persons with whom

280
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,180
he had transacted in the market so the

281
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,960
court determined that he was not liable

282
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,300
for insider trading at the time so the

283
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,950
SEC actually modified the definition of

284
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,689
insider trading so that if another case

285
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,570
like this did appear it would get Cuba

286
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,860
we get covered under insider trading so

287
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:06,240
now they have actually called this

288
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:08,670
particular term outsider trading so

289
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,230
another one this was actually this a

290
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,569
group of hackers got really smart they

291
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,340
actually targeted PR firms you know when

292
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,810
you're a public traded company you get

293
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,250
your press releases ready you know game

294
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,560
you announce your earnings you send that

295
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,310
out it's another awesome target if

296
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,500
you're looking for this type of

297
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,180
information and this is where we

298
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,640
actually found like folks that were

299
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,130
communicating via darknets there was a

300
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,780
lot of other investors involved this

301
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,550
particular case that actually these guys

302
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,300
were doing these trades up to i was

303
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:38,189
actually passed 2014 almost into 2015

304
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:41,339
the hackers well one of the guys was

305
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:44,280
names of vadimovich and i'm realizing

306
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:46,740
these names so what happened was he got

307
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,980
busted in the ukraine for stolen credit

308
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,570
cards when they actually went they think

309
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,610
they got his system and the FBI got

310
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,680
access to that as well but they were

311
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,060
working with the ukraine police that's

312
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,459
when they actually discovered this

313
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,869
particular scheme they would not have

314
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,300
known that these guys were doing this

315
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,550
unless that one guy he did something

316
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,649
stupid he was doing still

317
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,089
my cards and things like that and these

318
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:10,459
guys made it over like 50 million

319
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:12,140
dollars so these are the hackers and

320
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:13,459
then there's a new boy group so there's

321
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,019
a number of people that were actually

322
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:15,979
part of this there were 35 different

323
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:18,170
people that were involved in these

324
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,720
trades they're all over the world these

325
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:23,060
guys were financial wizards one of these

326
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,570
guys he was actually a former VP at

327
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,569
Morgan Stanley

328
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,680
so the hackers the way they worked the

329
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:34,130
first target they went after was this

330
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:37,250
one particular a PR like newswire called

331
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:39,439
market wired they did a sequel injection

332
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:42,050
and they were able to install reverse

333
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,910
shells and then they were able to you

334
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,560
know access various internal login

335
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,560
credentials they were able to escalate

336
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,609
their privileges fairly quickly for

337
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,810
looking at some of the stuff with market

338
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,430
wired they weren't logging a lot of

339
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,109
information I was actually trying to dig

340
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,910
deeper into this and really reading into

341
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,160
some of the criminal complaints so that

342
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:00,140
raised some challenges as well but

343
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,390
luckily a lot of that information was on

344
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,939
one fellow's computer and that's how

345
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,500
they were able to use that as evidence

346
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,839
they downloaded over a hundred thousand

347
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,940
press releases right that's what they

348
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,500
did and then what they did is they they

349
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,440
uploaded them they actually created a

350
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,730
hidden service they uploaded it to a

351
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,250
website and then they want on these

352
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:22,220
various criminal hacker forums and they

353
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,899
advertised their their access and for as

354
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,730
little as ten thousand dollars you can

355
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:27,589
get access to this huge repository of

356
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,910
earnings information it's a pretty good

357
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:30,110
deal especially when you can make you

358
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:34,010
know three hundred thousand dollars in

359
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,149
one of those transactions and one of

360
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,800
these traders actually got access to

361
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:38,870
that some information there was two or

362
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,719
folks that started on this and then they

363
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,680
started getting other people involved

364
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,360
but then they got greedy

365
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,630
right they targeted another firm called

366
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,300
a PR Newswire this group had a little

367
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:52,939
bit more tighter security they actually

368
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,729
threw these guys out three times the

369
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,459
first time they got in they didn't

370
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,050
attack the second time they actually

371
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:01,550
installed malware on a system and they

372
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,699
were able to excellent rate data that

373
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:06,319
way and that was identified and then

374
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:08,390
they lost access this was over the

375
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,399
course of several years they lost access

376
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:12,140
and then one of the guys actually bought

377
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,620
on the darknet they bought a bunch of

378
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,270
social media logins a huge repository of

379
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,830
it and

380
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,240
just happened to be that some of the

381
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,460
login credentials that people are using

382
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,230
for social media they're using the same

383
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,910
accounts for their admin accounts here I

384
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:31,510
know that never happens in real life

385
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:33,400
rightly so and then then another one

386
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,410
they did was business wire and this one

387
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,750
they actually bought access from a

388
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,819
hacker who was advertising he told them

389
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,440
hey I've already gotten inside here you

390
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,910
know I don't want to get involved with

391
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,040
the selling this information you guys

392
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,079
obviously already have customers so they

393
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,160
just sold access directly right so it is

394
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,110
becoming a pretty big business

395
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,280
enterprise right they're making it quite

396
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,680
a bit of money from this they've got

397
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,420
lots of customers they even have awesome

398
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,489
customer service because one of the

399
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,110
pieces of evidence that was used against

400
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,120
them is they actually created a video

401
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,890
showing customers how to go about

402
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,970
actually accessing this information on

403
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,970
their repository

404
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:19,810
so the traders were actually opened up

405
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:21,970
several different trade accounts like

406
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,959
infidelity so all these different

407
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,280
companies were actually involved in the

408
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,070
trade leaving we're creating shell

409
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,900
companies to try to hide this as well so

410
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,940
they did a really good job I mean the

411
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,470
the white-collar side of this they

412
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,320
really knew what they were doing the

413
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:37,570
hackers as well and they made around

414
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,120
thirty million dollars that numbers

415
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:42,940
actually changed one of the guys he

416
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,280
actually he pled not guilty he was kind

417
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,390
of the mastermind behind all this and it

418
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,980
actually came out that it was over a

419
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:51,310
hundred million dollars and they only

420
00:14:47,980 --> 00:15:00,670
recovered fifty three million um also

421
00:14:51,310 --> 00:15:03,339
they made some mistakes though too so

422
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,900
some of the IP addresses that they

423
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,030
actually went in and they went to the PR

424
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,610
Newswire they they luckily had kept

425
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:11,170
their of their logs they actually found

426
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,210
that one of the one or two of the

427
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,439
traders actually set up trading accounts

428
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,180
for the hackers that were actually

429
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,500
involved in this right I think at some

430
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,900
point they said hey you guys are making

431
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,700
all this money once you guys help us and

432
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:25,870
then what happened is the forgot to

433
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:27,730
change the his IP or as VPN login and

434
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,800
you think cover his tracks so there was

435
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,450
actually the same IP address was logging

436
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,160
into the PR Newswire that was doing the

437
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,570
hacking and it was also logging into

438
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,189
some of those trading accounts and that

439
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,480
was another correlation that was

440
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,490
actually used against them as evidence

441
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,560
so that's a really good case where

442
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,900
sometimes you might have log files it

443
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,329
may not be useful for you now but it

444
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,180
could be useful for FBI or someone else

445
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:52,510
that is conducting an investigation

446
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:54,310
which could be good or bad right so this

447
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,030
is sort of some of the transactions that

448
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,099
they made

449
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:59,020
there was a caterpillar was one of the

450
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,760
big companies that they did this with

451
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,590
but there were I mean there were over

452
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,850
800 trades were based on some of those

453
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:06,520
press releases that they had actually

454
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,140
made so you start to see you know you

455
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,960
know this is a pretty good day's day's

456
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,340
haul well I get a real job when you can

457
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:16,900
just you know make tons of money just

458
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:20,100
doing stock trades this is the fellow he

459
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:23,110
was the former VP at Morgan Stanley and

460
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,460
he made around 17.5 that actually has

461
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,220
increased to around like 30 million or

462
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,690
so and he pled not guilty

463
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,670
what's really interesting though is you

464
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:36,810
know after he left Morgan Stanley he

465
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:38,949
became a pastor and his his congregation

466
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,989
actually was trying to do fundraising

467
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:43,090
for him so this was a really this gets

468
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,980
really really weird I mean actually when

469
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:46,780
he pled not guilty and act he was

470
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,820
actually in court and a bunch of his

471
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,589
person errors or whatever they actually

472
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,440
came and we're actually trying to help

473
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:57,280
him through this and do you think he was

474
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,680
guilty or not guilty yeah they found him

475
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,050
guilty and he's going to be doing at

476
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,419
least like a maximum I think it's 20

477
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,639
years in prison for his involvement in

478
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,079
this several other people had pled

479
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,100
guilty and they actually test ended up

480
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:14,109
testifying against him so some of the

481
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,520
data sources that are with this I like

482
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:16,929
to kind of this is where I like to look

483
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,730
at this is you know what data sources

484
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,829
are actually involved so the online

485
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:23,439
brokerage web servers and application

486
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:25,300
logs was really helpful to have the bank

487
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,819
records right being able to have access

488
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,260
to that you can identify especially some

489
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:30,850
of the folks on the white-collar fraud

490
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,160
side they have access to some of that

491
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,240
I've actually done some things where

492
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,160
I've Splunk some of that data

493
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,140
I've actually did some investigations

494
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,110
bringing that data in looking for

495
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,280
irregularities some business registry

496
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,409
data because they were actually creating

497
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,940
a lot of different shell companies one

498
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,890
of them even have an ice cream it was an

499
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,030
ice cream company and all one year all

500
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:52,900
of a sudden it became incredibly

501
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:55,480
profitable the newswire user

502
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,850
authentication of VPN logs the forensic

503
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,530
images from Hermitage computer that's

504
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,689
really what helped drive a lot of this

505
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:04,180
stuff if he had covered his tracks

506
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,470
better encrypted that or you know got

507
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,210
rid of those who destroyed the drives

508
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,580
there wouldn't be the evidence against a

509
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:11,140
lot of these folks there was a video

510
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,879
tutorial made by Irma and how to

511
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,850
actually download those files right that

512
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,340
was really helpful for the FBI some of

513
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,659
the tools compromised credentials so a

514
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,949
lot of these accounts they didn't have

515
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,780
any sort of multi-factor authentication

516
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,910
it was just username and password that's

517
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,950
that's not good right hopefully that's

518
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,420
changing there was some advanced malware

519
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,970
that was involved there was sequel and

520
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,350
sequel injection definitely lack of

521
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,740
appropriate logging and one of the news

522
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,389
wires

523
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,800
you know if they would have been looking

524
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,870
for some of those regularities maybe the

525
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,049
other two might have not

526
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:42,120
popped and then of course tor and

527
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:44,580
proxies right if you see someone logging

528
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,229
into tor and accessing your server

529
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,090
that's pretty easy to do nowadays

530
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,460
that's maybe something you want to pay

531
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,709
attention to maybe they're just trying

532
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,360
to you know protect their privacy but if

533
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,279
they're accessing like a brokerage firm

534
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,600
or something like that I'm saying I'm

535
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:58,770
thinking like ninety-nine percent of the

536
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,668
time that's going to be some sort of

537
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:04,559
criminal activity another form was

538
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:07,440
actually targeting another type of

539
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:10,279
attack was targeting legal firms the use

540
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,279
of guys were in China

541
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:16,860
neither the hackers they even had a

542
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,570
whole business plan around that they had

543
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,649
PowerPoint decks of how they're gonna go

544
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,010
about doing this

545
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:25,260
so again that's really useful evidence

546
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:27,929
they go through this process right so

547
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:30,059
around July 31st they targeted their

548
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:32,250
first law firm it was a New York law

549
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:34,350
firm in some of the criminal complaints

550
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,730
the the law firms were able to mask who

551
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,740
actually was so I didn't I don't know

552
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:39,260
specifically what they were I have some

553
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,179
guesses but they're pretty heavy hitters

554
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,100
and then they're able to download some

555
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,539
information and this is where they're

556
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,939
actually looking for data that's tied

557
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:49,649
around mergers and acquisitions right so

558
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,580
we've gone from PR and earnings now

559
00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:52,350
we're looking at mergers and

560
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,320
acquisitions so that's another piece of

561
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:57,059
valuable data so they actually looked at

562
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,789
so there was the Roche acquisition of

563
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:01,559
inter mune Intel's acquisition of

564
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:03,360
Volterra and then they were actually

565
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:06,690
trading information that they discovered

566
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,279
they target a second law firm and this

567
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,870
one they looked at the Pitney Bowes

568
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:12,450
acquisition BorderFree

569
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:14,668
and these guys generated around three

570
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:18,360
million dollars in funds again that's

571
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:20,309
that's pretty good day's work right and

572
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,770
these what they actually ended up making

573
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:24,418
so each of these guys made over a few of

574
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:26,340
them made almost a million a few of them

575
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:31,590
half a million they had to pay all of

576
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:33,480
this back there was actually a few guys

577
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,820
I'm not sure if you guys remember this

578
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,010
it was findt four there was actually a

579
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,439
fire I actually did a really cool

580
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:42,090
write-up on this these guys were

581
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,380
actually targeting primarily like

582
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,809
pharmaceutical companies and they were

583
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,340
doing the spearfishing campaigns they

584
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:48,850
were actually trying to get in so they

585
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,169
can monitor email in

586
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,850
in the companies right they're not

587
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,470
necessarily exfiltrating sort of data

588
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,820
what they just want to do is monitor and

589
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,070
they're looking for anything that would

590
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:00,570
be useful for trading in Viet M&A type

591
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:03,310
of activity and things like that and

592
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:04,600
they actually sent a request to breach

593
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,340
decrease details to at least eight

594
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,290
companies some of those companies didn't

595
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,689
know they were compromised right and

596
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,710
then the SEC is now involved and they

597
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,060
actually found that some of those

598
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,970
companies didn't have proper security

599
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:21,639
controls in place so there can be some

600
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:25,600
some legal results of that SEC wasn't

601
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:28,270
they're not invulnerable either some

602
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,949
brazen hackers actually access the Edgar

603
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,750
database this is where companies

604
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:34,870
actually upload a lot of company filing

605
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:36,310
information and things like that they

606
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,050
got compromised but there wasn't a lot

607
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:40,480
of information about this they they know

608
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:42,040
that information was exposed but they

609
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,270
didn't go into any other detail about

610
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,220
how that information might have been

611
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:47,110
used they were monitoring they're

612
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,400
looking for you know if people that

613
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,899
might be trading on that particular

614
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,580
information but again that type of

615
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:55,300
activity can be really difficult to

616
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:57,399
identify between a legal versus illegal

617
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,720
versus a legal trade you really have to

618
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,040
be able to dig deeper into that

619
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,630
especially if they're really smart and

620
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,180
know how they're doing it you can do it

621
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:09,160
in smaller transactions right and you

622
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:11,260
can go go under the radar um so I did

623
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,850
dug pretty deep in some of the you know

624
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,840
in dark web looking at some of these

625
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:18,669
these services that we're offering

626
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,050
insider information there's several

627
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,780
forums where you can actually if you

628
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:25,450
provide insider information they'll make

629
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,340
you part of ember and then you can start

630
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:30,610
to actually trade on that information as

631
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,409
well so I'm not gonna give you guys the

632
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:35,530
URLs for these I don't wanna get in

633
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:37,450
trouble this was interesting there was a

634
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:39,340
forum you know he's actually talking

635
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:41,110
about he actually works for a major Wall

636
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,120
Street company does millions of trades a

637
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,830
day he has access to a bunch of

638
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,320
information around some of this stuff

639
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:50,350
and he was even saying hey I'll give you

640
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,600
this information will do it 50/50 you

641
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,889
know give you hard cash or Bitcoin and

642
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,290
he'll make sure that there's no paper

643
00:22:53,890 --> 00:23:01,420
trail right this website there was a I

644
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:03,190
think I'm not sure if this was was

645
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,630
or not again this one's where you

646
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,310
actually have to provide them insider

647
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,740
information to actually get to get

648
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:11,409
become a member and I'm not sure if this

649
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:14,380
is either it's real or it could be the

650
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:17,020
SEC in law enforcement trying to get

651
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:20,800
people so I did not submit anything not

652
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:23,110
even fake stuff so I'm just telling so a

653
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:26,200
lot of the trading firms they do a lot

654
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:28,000
to monitor traitors right so I was

655
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,260
actually actually talking to one

656
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,880
particular company that does this and

657
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,260
they go yeah we monitor every single

658
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,390
every phone call

659
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,560
they monitor Skype they're monitoring

660
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,820
all these types of things because they

661
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,500
want to make sure that they're not doing

662
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,939
any sort of insider trading because you

663
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,740
know that can be a huge fine for them

664
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,850
and can put them out of business well

665
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,560
what's interesting is that they don't

666
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,540
necessarily monitor what they're doing

667
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,620
when they go home right so if someone

668
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,260
has access to that some of that

669
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,239
information that's that's that's really

670
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,910
easy for them to you know they're using

671
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,250
encrypted chat app you know going to tor

672
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:59,260
there's also the good old paper route

673
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:01,690
right just writing a note on a piece of

674
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:03,970
piece of paper and that's actually what

675
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:06,490
happened in this next case there was a

676
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:08,260
fellow he worked at Bank of America and

677
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:10,990
he worked in IT and he had access to a

678
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:15,610
bunch of information his name was Daniel

679
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:17,770
Revis so he's had access to these these

680
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:20,169
kind of big file shares that we're

681
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:23,200
dealing with mergers and acquisitions of

682
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:27,040
companies and what happened was he just

683
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,350
would write these little notes to his

684
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,060
girlfriend at the time they would be

685
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:33,459
love notes but in those love notes would

686
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:36,790
be communication about a particular

687
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:39,070
stock he would say he would have a way

688
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:40,990
of putting the the name of the the

689
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,879
company of the stock ticker and then

690
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:44,050
also some pricing information as well so

691
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,300
he made him look like there were these

692
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:48,639
sort of paper love letters she would

693
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,250
then hand them off to her father who

694
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,810
would then he will also ended up sharing

695
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,770
some of that information over time with

696
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:58,840
other people that were involved and then

697
00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:00,070
he got a little dump he had some friend

698
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,470
one friend that was having some

699
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,970
financial difficulties so he started

700
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:06,490
giving some of that information to him

701
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:08,980
and they were using an encrypted chat

702
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:12,430
app right they would actually destroy or

703
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:14,200
supposed to destroy messages that's if

704
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,220
the other person deletes it right so he

705
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,360
would delete them on his phone

706
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,250
what some of his friends weren't so

707
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,549
smart and they still had them on the

708
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:23,440
phone when the law enforcement came so

709
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:25,179
on that particular case so there was a

710
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,710
lot of different types of organizations

711
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:28,929
that are getting targeted for this type

712
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:30,370
of information so the data we want to go

713
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:32,890
after if you're a hacker you want to go

714
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:35,080
look at for earnings reports patent

715
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:37,390
information I've seen some cases with

716
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,710
that so if you're a legal firm you know

717
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,940
you're working with patents if you know

718
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,830
that someone's going to get a patent

719
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,270
approved or not that can be incredibly

720
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:45,428
valuable information because that's

721
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:48,820
going to have an impact on the stock any

722
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:50,200
sort of M&A activity FDA status right so

723
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,870
that can be a big deal if someone's

724
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,880
gonna you know maybe a drug isn't gonna

725
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:56,559
be approved for whatever reason that's

726
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,570
has it usually has a huge impact any

727
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,980
sort of pharmaceutical company that's

728
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:01,570
gonna you know if you can short the

729
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,610
stock what-have-you

730
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:06,309
I believe that vulnerabilities as well

731
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:08,199
can be an issue or if there is a breach

732
00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:09,760
if I know that a company was breached

733
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,470
before anyone else and I can trade on

734
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,990
that information I think there have been

735
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,880
some cases of that where organizations

736
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,440
where they have been breached and those

737
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,030
people actually did trade they knew that

738
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,929
information was gonna go public at some

739
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:24,129
point and so you made money that way

740
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:26,710
Manufacturing yields so even looking at

741
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:28,690
a factory and like ICS and even like

742
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:31,000
SCADA types of systems right if I can

743
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:32,650
identify maybe a secret formula or I

744
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,929
know how much product they're making I

745
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:37,510
can then make an assumption around how

746
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:40,570
much revenue they may have over the next

747
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:42,429
quarter so intellectual properly and you

748
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:43,629
sort of formulas so organizations are

749
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:45,850
gonna get targeted or give me legal

750
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:48,429
firms M&A firms PR firms investor

751
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:50,649
relations firms a factory any sort of

752
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:54,100
incident response and of course company

753
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:55,480
HR legal and IT so again there's a lot

754
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,530
of different organizations to be target

755
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,789
we could see that the companies

756
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,379
themselves may not necessarily be

757
00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:01,390
targeted in this case it's going to be

758
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,260
your service providers so one thing you

759
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:04,230
want to think about in your risk

760
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:06,820
assessments is what type of information

761
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:09,159
anything here are we sharing with maybe

762
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,870
our PR firm our legal firm what do they

763
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:12,220
have access to then we can actually

764
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,360
start to ask them questions about how

765
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,100
they're they're protecting that

766
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,600
information and hopefully when you show

767
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,590
them this deck you can you can show them

768
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:21,939
why why you care about that so some of

769
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:23,379
the tools you would look for a lot of

770
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,179
endpoint monitoring

771
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,260
I'm always frustrated when I go in and

772
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:27,640
people say yeah we're monitoring

773
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,840
endpoints but they're just getting

774
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,730
regular windows law

775
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,899
event logs you need to get a little bit

776
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:34,150
more fidelity especially when you're

777
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,640
doing malware investigations sis Mons

778
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:38,290
really great like it's a free tool

779
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,990
there's also OS query which is open

780
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:43,030
source commercial tools like CrowdStrike

781
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,110
Falcon carbon black all those types of

782
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:46,300
tools are gonna give you a little more

783
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:48,340
fidelity you may not necessarily win or

784
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,260
deploy to every single device in your

785
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,879
environment but maybe some of those

786
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,200
critical assets that house some of the

787
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,980
sensitive information that's what we

788
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,110
really want to make sure we're

789
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:59,700
monitoring for the love of God

790
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:59,699
multi-factor authentication please

791
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,880
looking at data loss prevention you know

792
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,770
a lot of DLP solutions that are out

793
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,900
there I've even seen people homegrown

794
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:09,580
homegrown some of this stuff I'm using

795
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,160
like plagiarize plagiarize ation

796
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,419
software so you can actually you know

797
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,150
see if any of that data is leaving your

798
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:18,610
organization via email what-have-you

799
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:21,640
proxy firewalls can be useful I do a lot

800
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:23,530
with our this one TVA product looking at

801
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,670
user behavior analytics where you're not

802
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:26,260
just looking at signatures you're

803
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:28,480
actually baselining behavior of

804
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,980
individuals assets and applications in

805
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,930
your environment and then you're looking

806
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,250
for anything that may stray from that if

807
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:35,350
all of a sudden someone in my

808
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:37,120
organization maybe accesses a file share

809
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,919
that they usually don't access and it's

810
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,760
a late in the evening right that's

811
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,950
something that I may want to pay

812
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,540
attention to it doesn't mean this is how

813
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,040
they're doing something bad but it is

814
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:49,780
something that might want to maybe

815
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:51,790
develop a hypothesis around doing this

816
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,500
assessment of your partners again so it

817
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,909
can be legal in PR I'm really surprised

818
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,290
how many companies don't actually do

819
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:58,120
this they do a great job of securing

820
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:59,379
their own infrastructure but they don't

821
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,639
ask the right questions when they're

822
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:03,250
looking at their service providers where

823
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,110
but whether it's a PR firm your legal

824
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,000
firm anyone maybe that's even handling

825
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,379
your HR data right you really want to be

826
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,410
able to understand how they're securing

827
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,520
that particular data do a phishing

828
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,860
exercises can be helpful

829
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,420
a lot of threat intelligence sharing if

830
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,979
you see that some of those PR firms are

831
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,300
all being targeted right if they start

832
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,570
sharing information about some of these

833
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,860
things hey we've noticed this this

834
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:25,419
suspicious activity have you guys been

835
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,649
seeing something similar here are some

836
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,080
of the IP addresses that are associated

837
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:30,250
with this you know maybe if the they

838
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,960
collaborate a little bit more they can

839
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:36,910
identify some of these things before law

840
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:39,220
enforcement does looking at all the data

841
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:41,440
- I do a lot with the insider threat so

842
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,520
you know some of these look familiar I

843
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,660
mean a lot of technical data

844
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,980
courses that you may have around your

845
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,720
network and in about your environment

846
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,090
but there's also a lot of great

847
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,520
non-technical data sources that can come

848
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:56,169
from HR and from other or other

849
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:58,150
organizations within your company I do a

850
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,320
lot around insider threat I like kill

851
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,540
chains you guys are probably familiar

852
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,070
with the Lockheed Martin kill chain so

853
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,750
this is an insider threat kill chain I

854
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,950
actually stole it from a fellow at the

855
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,360
FBI

856
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,300
they actually leverage this for

857
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,949
conducting their own insider

858
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:13,960
investigations for FBI agents when

859
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:16,570
they're actually looking into them but

860
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,710
there's things you can look for if you

861
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,659
know that someone is having financial

862
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,220
difficulties for example that can be an

863
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:23,140
indicator of someone we may want to have

864
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,100
more verbose logging again it doesn't

865
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,470
mean that they've they're doing

866
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,270
something malicious or illegal but

867
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:29,790
depending on you know your your industry

868
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,860
and what you're doing you may want to

869
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:33,850
monitor that a little bit more closely

870
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,189
there's things you can do on the search

871
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:38,500
and recon looking at not more technical

872
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,780
data sources usually if someone's going

873
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,580
to break bad as I refer to it

874
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,010
they usually probe first they usually

875
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:48,220
see what they have access to they try to

876
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:50,170
identify what data they can actually get

877
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,550
into and then you'll actually start to

878
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:53,920
see the acquisition and collection of

879
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:56,470
that particular data and then there's

880
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:59,260
the exfiltration or our damage to

881
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:00,610
systems so again there's non technical

882
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:03,129
indicators this is kind of where you'd

883
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:05,620
be able to start to actually look for

884
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:07,870
indicators there this can also leverage

885
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,159
a lot of like UVA if you use machine

886
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,379
learning things like that you can start

887
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,100
to identify things that are suspicious

888
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,720
and then you're gonna have the more

889
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,679
technical indicators right those are

890
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,870
things that we're probably more familiar

891
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:20,200
with and with our traditional security

892
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:22,419
data sources I'm doing more research on

893
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,190
this there's quite a bit more to this

894
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:26,650
that's coming I'm digging into some

895
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,060
other where who are actually having

896
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:29,350
cases where there's a breach and we're

897
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,610
actually seeing the hackers trading on

898
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:33,100
that knowing that the breach is going to

899
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:35,860
be notified there's also a concern now

900
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:38,290
too is if someone identifies a zero-day

901
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,310
vulnerability and they know that they're

902
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,450
going to announce that at a certain

903
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,190
point and they share that with someone

904
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,570
and they trade on that information that

905
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:48,610
can still also be considered insider

906
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:50,020
trading as well or outsider trading so

907
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:52,260
if you guys have any questions ideas or

908
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:55,289
