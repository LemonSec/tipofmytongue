so how about a really big round of

2
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:14,300
applause for our b-sides Edmonton

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:14,300
volunteers who put this thing on please

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,028
when possible when you're seeing our

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,429
b-sides volunteers please give them a

6
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,410
hug because I don't know if any of you

7
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:29,070
have ever tried to run something like

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,630
this before I once once and I've managed

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,780
multi-million dollar projects in the

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,210
past I've once tried to run a or was

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,220
that the active start Jamboree for ring

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,250
at it was six ringette teams for a bunch

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,500
of six-year-olds and a darn Hitler

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,170
killed me so the fact that they put this

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,030
on this is fantastic first time in

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,810
Edmonton besides have been in Calgary a

17
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,180
couple times

18
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,490
first b-sides I ever went to was in

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,260
Toronto which was held in a bar it was

20
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,390
fantastic talking about security and

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,300
drinking craft beer all day long it was

22
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,770
absolutely fun so my name is Adam it's

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,158
really special for me to be able to wear

24
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:09,659
the number 56 the green and gold because

25
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,670
about a year ago moved to Calgary so

26
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,799
talking about I want to talk about all

27
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,090
the things were information security

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,039
people for the most part maybe

29
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,810
information technology people we always

30
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:20,640
believe that were the smartest people in

31
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,609
the room because quite frankly we are

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,159
right and we do suffer ourselves from

33
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:27,539
that special snowflake syndrome the

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,969
unrecognized personalities sort of

35
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:31,950
destroying the world and some things

36
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:34,229
happened a few years ago and that we

37
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,539
want to call ourselves hackers right

38
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:39,030
Jurassic Park my favorite movie of all

39
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:40,979
time I'm not a nerd I'm a hacker yeah

40
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,189
that was fantastic but then all of a

41
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,780
sudden apt 26 also known as fancy bearer

42
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,648
trying to do the Russian dance for you

43
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,829
and other state-sponsored folks like I

44
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,810
don't know Lazarus group North Korea

45
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:57,568
they started giving the evil hacker a

46
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,569
bad name right so no not an evil hacker

47
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:03,270
anymore we're security researchers right

48
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:05,159
we you know that's been my mantra all

49
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,209
along is I like taking things apart and

50
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,500
then seeing what falls over oh I'm gonna

51
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,170
go back

52
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:18,060
oh this thing is just tricky as heck I

53
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:21,510
love it okay there is okay Tom Selleck

54
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,850
really doesn't want the page this is

55
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,530
your platform besides is your platform

56
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,570
as information technology information

57
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,459
security people the reason that I want

58
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,440
to put this talk together is because in

59
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,970
the course of my regular job that I've

60
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,070
had for about six months I'm doing a lot

61
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,140
of investigations so I actually went and

62
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,760
got a professional investigator license

63
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,429
which makes me feel like Tom Selleck in

64
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:49,109
this Ferrari magnum p.i yah except I'm a

65

those of you that are fans of Javad

that i have to adhere to but those guys

92
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,670
outside they don't need to adhere to

93
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,530
anything so just talk to me we do have a

94
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,298
code of ethics if we have professional

95
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,560
certifications I pay an incredible

96
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:05,400
amount every year in annual maintenance

97
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,140
fees I'm sure a lot of you do to talk at

98
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,940
besides Calgary last year was about

99
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,220
bootstrapping your own security projects

100
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,109
I want to hack the next TV I'm just

101
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,180
gonna go to Costco and buy it

102
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,829
hack the crap out of it and then take it

103
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,450
back to Costco and everybody in the room

104
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:22,620
went ooh that's a neat idea but well how

105
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,820
does that fit into your personal

106
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,800
personal ethos

107
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,730
and I use keeper security as an example

108
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,050
of maybe that's not the best thing Tavis

109
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,700
almond II I don't know if anybody's

110
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,250
hurted to have a psalmody he works for

111
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,940
Google he is one of the the most amazing

112
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,050
security researchers on the planet

113
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,630
essentially what happens when Tavis

114
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,580
points his laser focus on somebody two

115
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:47,250
things happen the company that his laser

116
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,930
focus goes on it says haha right on free

117
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,460
pen test and then they go aw crap

118
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,670
doesn't matter what happens this kind of

119
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,400
fall over so keep her security had a

120
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,590
really serious issue with their stuff

121
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,080
Tavis found it and a guy named Dan good

122
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,750
and published it on ARS technica keeper

123
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,190
security said you jackass you can't

124
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,830
publish that you can't tell everybody

125
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,390
that we're a security company we're

126
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,190
secure you can't tell people that were

127
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:15,990
not and they sued the crap out of them

128
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:18,360
as a journalist so Dan's ethos did not

129
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:23,100
match up with the law team that he'd

130
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:27,950
those security you can't have an ethics

131
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,950
issue if you don't have any at this yeah

132
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,840
so talking about nothing yeah how many

133
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,750
of you exist in in computer security

134
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,590
echo chambers I often do right

135
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,790
I thank you Nancy peered god that is a

136
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,250
glorious beard

137
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,050
I have beard Envy like you wouldn't

138
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,720
believe I can't it all I could grow is

139
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,210
this nasty 1970s porno stash it's

140
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,690
terrible Movember is a real rough year

141
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,890
for me police disclosure form and I'm

142
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,000
just gonna burn through a couple of

143
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,909
these things like have you ever been

144
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,340
chased or pursued by the police foot or

145
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:05,850
motor vehicle yes or no this is part of

146
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,710
a 40 some-odd page document that you

147
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,570
fill out as the first step if you want

148
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,880
to become a police officer this is their

149
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:14,159
determination of the kind of things that

150
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,270
they're trying to do to figure out if

151
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,370
you're someone that should go through

152
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,719
the police recruitment process I'm not

153
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,000

looking for the next captain Canada you

163
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,549
want to make sure that they've got a

164
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:47,210
really good ethos right then you get to

165

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,970
hacking configured use wireless

173
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,390
technology for the purpose of gaining

174
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:22,220
unauthorized access wardriving

175
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:24,080
does anybody wore drive it of course

176

downloaded otherwise obtained commercial

179
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,120
software manipulated with patches cracks

180
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:40,099
registration keys that allowed it to

181
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:42,050
work Adobe so this talked anyone over

182
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:45,610
the Internet I don't know who's never

183
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,900
doxxed anybody on Lync dinner Facebook

184
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:51,260
have you ever done anything naughty with

185
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,630
email dr. evil himself doesn't know what

186
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,789
the hell to do with this right and at

187
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,440
the end of this police disclosure form

188
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:59,720
it also has a thing at the bottom that

189
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,430
says along the lines of if you have you

190
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,410
know whatever you've done here becomes a

191
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,830
legal document and you can be charged

192
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:09,620
for the offenses you've just admitted to

193
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:11,810
these are offenses so in our personal

194
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,930
ethos all of a sudden this torrid box

195
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:18,320
that we got sitting at home maybe that's

196
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:21,710
not viewed as ethically as the rest of

197
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,000
the room might feel it is so what is the

198
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,159
worst that could happen the title of my

199
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,720
talk the whole reason I'm here and going

200
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:31,610
through all this stuff in this

201
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,080
investigators license course it made me

202
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,450
realize the things yes we do have a

203
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,770
constitution in Canada we don't talk

204
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,210
about it a whole lot yes we do have a

205
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,340
Charter of Rights and Freedoms and it

206
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,770
talks about the kinds of things that we

207
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:45,260
can be charged with by the crown Her

208
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,750
Majesty herself comes out from on high

209
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:55,220
and hits us with there's a 2x4 here

210
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:58,250
originally oh yes I get props fantastic

211
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,810
so there's three kinds of charges that

212
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,940
you can get in Canada a summary

213
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,770
conviction which is the little stuff

214
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,960
which means that you can be charged up

215
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,010
to two thousand dollars five thousand

216
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,740
dollars depending on the kind

217
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:11,930
offence or 6 months in prison that's the

218
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,690
little stuff that's you know one level

219
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,339
above a traffic ticket there's an

220
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,040
indictable offence that's where the

221
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,780
juries come into play that's the big

222
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,790
stuff so that's up to 20 years in prison

223
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,439
that's you've killed your mom that's bad

224
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:27,380
things then then there's a hybrid

225
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,170
offense so you know a break and enter

226
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,480
where you didn't shoot anybody is kind

227
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,339
of a well it's not really a summary

228
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,660
conviction but it's not really

229
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:39,950
indictable offense so they call it a

230
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:43,100
hybrid and so we do have a constitution

231
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:45,050
it's not really all that famous like our

232
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,870
one true God and and going around and

233
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:51,260
stealing the Constitution and not to say

234
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:53,510
that Canadian politics is boring as our

235
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:56,540
Ford brothers in eastern Canada have

236
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:58,340
shown us right that was our that was our

237
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:02,390
buddy Rob and his brother Doug isn't

238
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:03,770
necessarily showing us up either but you

239
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,140
can't forget about this national

240
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:09,470
treasure from Western Canada himself

241
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:13,430
right the proponent of shoot shovel is

242
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:15,860
shot at so let's talk about the mack

243
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:20,180
daddy to those of us who like to take

244
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:22,040
things apart with computers three 42.1

245
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:26,300
unauthorized use of a computer everyone

246
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:28,099
is guilty of an indictable offence not

247
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,930
necessarily a small one and liable to

248
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,060
imprisonment for a term of not more than

249
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,219
ten years or is guilty of an offense

250
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:37,640
punishable on summary conviction a

251
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,260
little one who fraudulently and without

252
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,170
color of right and it talks about all

253
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:45,290
sorts of good things there's one No

254
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:48,410
so using a computer to screw with things

255
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:50,360
and this is a criminal charge and then

256
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,689
we start analyzing we go hahahaha

257
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,640
password yeah because we use passwords

258
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,200
now when you actually go into the

259
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,870
definitions what they're talking about

260
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,110
with a password is anything that you can

261
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:04,460
use to gain a system that could be a

262
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,110
public key that could be a private key

263
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:09,710
that could be a fingerprint that could

264
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:14,900
be a Yubikey all these things that we

265
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:16,520
can use to access a system so uses

266
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,569
possesses traffics and permits another

267
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,819
person to have access to a computer

268
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,040
password sounds a lot like these

269
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,019
disclosures and

270
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,849
oxes and things right getting a little

271
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:29,709
dangerous this is another big one so

272
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,269
when I started going through this

273
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:32,380
process I thought about the hackers in

274
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:33,550
the room and I think we got lots of

275
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,540
hackers in the room but we also have

276
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,969
lots of people who are doing blue

277
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,130
teaming and sometimes our employers

278
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:43,509
demand things of us that aren't

279
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:45,160
necessarily legal 183 point one where

280
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:46,509
private communication is originated by a

281
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,810
more than one person or is intended by

282
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:52,300
the originator consent of the

283
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,500
interception is sufficient consent for

284
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,839
the purposes of any provision of this

285
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,790
part you've heard about one-party

286
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,639
consent states in the US and two parties

287
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:03,540
consent States Canada as a whole is a

288
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:10,389
single party consent that means if

289
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:13,899
Thomas and me are in a room and he

290
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:18,490
hasn't consented to the recording and I

291
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:21,550
have I can record it that's legal but if

292
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,319
my boss comes to me and says those two

293
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:29,050
people are having a meeting I want you

294
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:31,029
to record it that's not legal everyone

295
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,319
by means of electromagnetic acoustic

296
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:33,699
mechanical or other device willfully

297
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:35,620
intercepts a private communication is

298
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:37,839
guilty of an indictable offense and

299
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,540
liable to imprisonment for a term of not

300
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,240
exceeding five years somebody starts

301
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:46,569
saying I want to record phone messages

302
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,760
in our office I want to record phone

303
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:50,889
conversations between our customers and

304
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,920
our sales agents but nobody has

305
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:56,529
consented that could be five years in

306
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:04,810
prison if the wrong people start making

307
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:08,139
the wrong messages dangerzone pour one

308
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:10,689
out for a bloody Bert

309
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:14,290
rest in peace danger some of my favorite

310
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:17,469
guy Archer sterling Archer so more on

311
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:18,880
the devices and modification so everyone

312
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,560
who possesses sells or purchase any

313
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,240
electromagnetic acoustic mechanical or

314
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,969
other device or component knowing that

315
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,939
design etc etc what this means is if you

316
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:30,850
take a device and you modify it so that

317
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:33,160
it can record things that nobody has

318
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,500
consented to that's illegal

319
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,130
and that even becomes a bit of a gray

320
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,230
area

321
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:40,840
if you've modified something you've

322
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:44,250
taken a device I don't know a cell phone

323
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:47,410
and modified it to record your wife's

324
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:50,440
conversations that could be five years

325
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,490
in prison that's why you don't see a lot

326
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,020
of these kind of apps on the App Store

327
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,210
people are asking all the time how do I

328
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,920
record conversations well the apps can

329
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,260
be found but they're getting harder and

330
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,329
harder because there could be prison

331
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:04,900
sentences as a result the other one that

332
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:07,720
I put on here too is GPS this is a very

333
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,730
great area in Canada this particular

334
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,170
device here is available for $59 on

335
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:16,360
amazon.com it's called the cheater

336
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:18,010
tracker and a lot of these devices get

337
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,180
used so this one is used typically by

338
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,460
private investigators or law enforcement

339
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,560
it's a little OtterBox looking thing it

340
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,200
goes up underneath your your your car

341
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,079
you cannot place one of these on

342
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,090
someone's vehicle in a private space you

343
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,460
cannot place one of these on a vehicle

344
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:35,380
in theory without consent and if there

345
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:38,170
is without consent and you're going to

346
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,580
try to get that admissible in court you

347
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:43,329
have to prove that you have tried

348
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:44,740
everything else first before going that

349
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,660
directions that could be a very great

350
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,720
area you're not likely to get in trouble

351
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,790
for it but you're not likely to get the

352
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,920
results you want if you're trying to be

353
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,920
the one doing something legally related

354
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,479
people talk all the time well things got

355
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,710
broken into there is a data breach there

356
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,020
is or whatever does break-and-enter

357
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,970
apply and that bear does not know how to

358
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,510
play the piano he has broken into that

359
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,130
house

360
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:11,710
no break-and-enter will never apply

361
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:14,980
break means you have actually physically

362
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:17,350
broken a lock or a key or a door or

363
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:20,980
something to enter and they use the term

364
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:23,230
a dwelling so okay if I owned your nest

365
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,870

366
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,620
killing your dudes yeah kind of but

367
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,120
you're not gonna get charged with

368
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,440
breaking in it well you couldn't have

369
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,720
getting charged with this things like

370
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,910
mischief mischief is an interesting

371
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,260
charge summary conviction hybrid all

372
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,660
sorts of goodies depending on what

373
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,939
you've done or theft as the monkey is

374
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,819
stealing a hubcap you can especially

375
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,410
surrounding intellectual property if you

376
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,140
happen to have broken into something and

377
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,819
steal

378
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,140
something patented that could be really

379
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,230
bad for you as well

380
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:56,890
assault you can be charged with assault

381
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:58,690
as a result of things you say and do on

382
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:01,770
the Internet if it gets tied back to you

383
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:04,030
or impersonation with my Elvises

384
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:06,280
especially if you are at any point

385
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:08,500
impersonating a police officer or any

386
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,720
kind of peace officer by law whatever hi

387
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,600
I'm Adam from the internet police that

388
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,390
could be bad another disclaimer I'm not

389
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:23,620
a lawyer so if you're taking any of this

390
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:24,970
is legal advice you're so screwed so

391
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,620
we're talking about criminal law at this

392
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,140
point and I'm gonna burn through this

393
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:31,420
how do we do it for time give me like a

394
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,890
fiver when I'm getting close awesome

395
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,589
because I'm hungry and I wouldn't mind a

396
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:37,060
beer interpretation of the offense the

397
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,980
crown if you're going to be charged with

398
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,410
a criminal offense if you're going to go

399
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,590
to jail or get a fine of up to $10,000

400
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:46,510
and we're thinking okay how disruptive

401
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:52,630
would five years in jail be that would

402
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:55,750
really suck my youngest would be 14 the

403
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:57,340
crown must prove that the accused acted

404
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,950
without color of right and must be

405
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,530
acting dishonestly and in bad faith the

406
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,540
crown must prove that the accused had

407
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:07,420
the knowledge that the act and an

408
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:10,659
intended use was wrong so you they have

409
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:14,860
to prove that I was a dick and knew that

410
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:17,560
what I was doing was rather dickish how

411
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:22,719
many of you followed this case from Nova

412
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:26,619
Scotia yeah I like that people are angry

413
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,240
about this 19 year old faces one count

414
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:29,350
of unauthorized use of a computer

415
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,600
remember we talked about that a few

416
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:34,060
minutes ago teen charged over and over

417
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,620
Scotia privacy breach a 19 year old

418
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,120
unauthorized use of a computer seven

419
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,159
thousand documents four percent highly

420
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,530
sensitive information here's the

421
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,230
scenario to what I know and I don't know

422
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:47,110
a whole lot I reached out to the lawyers

423
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:49,450
that were representing this young man he

424
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,860
did what was essentially a fight what we

425
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,900
would know as a FOID proquest he paid

426
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,899
his $25.00 to the Nova Scotia government

427
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:58,870
to get some information back about a

428
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,770
teachers strike and he noticed that you

429
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,620
know they gave him

430
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:05,500
a URL so he puts the URL into his

431
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:07,870
browser and he got the information he's

432
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,990
looking for and then incremented the

433
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:18,100
number in the URL and got more

434
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:20,470
information is this hacking the CIO of

435
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,719
Nova Scotia oh yeah I don't know it was

436
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:24,910
hacking it was bad it was bad they went

437
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,770
to the police they've told this sob

438
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,120
story we've been hacked what does that

439
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:33,700
sound like to you and me it sounds like

440
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:36,310
frickin data breach right oh it was

441
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:40,990
absolutely a data breach and there's my

442
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:43,330
Carbon my respect my authority ah Sofia

443
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:45,310
I don't know if Uzi RCMP or the Halifax

444
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,659
police a police force did all sorts of

445
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,850
things they showed up at this kid's

446
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,860
house they emptied all the cupboards

447
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:53,320
they cut open all the mattresses they

448
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:57,669
arrested his little sister walk in while

449
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,560
she was walking home so he was charged

450
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,630
about a week later the charges were

451
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,179
dropped because somebody said oh we

452
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:06,670
screwed up but what's the worst that

453
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,770
happened to that kid for those two to

454
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:11,200
three weeks he was convinced that he was

455
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:13,330
going to jail for something that you

456
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,250
know he he scripted it w get is all he

457
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:18,010
did and downloaded 7,000 documents that

458
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,510
we went to school and he was convinced

459
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,620
that he would never get a job that he

460
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:23,620
would never get a university education

461
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,600
for a night remember being 19 and the

462
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:28,209
smallest thing you know some girl looked

463
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,240
at me funny and my world ends could you

464
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:33,850
imagine facing 10 years in prison and a

465
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,490
$10,000 fine at 19 and never being able

466
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,810
to you know make a living because you

467
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:44,560
are passionate about computer security

468
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:48,389
oh my goodness as compared to civil

469
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:51,820
suits so on a criminal suit the crown

470
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:55,030
Her Majesty herself has to prove that

471
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:56,470
you were bad and you meant to be bad

472
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,270
you're from the evil League of Evil and

473
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,790
you want to do bad things in a civil

474
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:03,490
suit instead it's this balance of

475
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:05,200
probabilities right for those that

476
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,940
remember OJ if the glove doesn't fit you

477
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,010
must acquit but he was still you know

478
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:12,610
civilly responsible how the hell does

479
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:13,390
that work because all that the all that

480
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:16,990
the

481
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:21,730
the plaintiff has to do is prove to 51%

482
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:23,350
of evidence that you were a dick they

483
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,420
don't have to prove to you know the

484
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:27,459
letter of everything and all that's good

485
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,710
and truthful they just have to say you

486
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,750
know if we have this much evidence we

487
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:35,130
just have to tip the scales this much

488
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:37,299
and you do a faceplant

489
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:39,280
and typically what does that turn into

490
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:42,010
money money money

491
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,410
thank you snoop it's all about money in

492
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:47,650
this scenario so what is worse five

493
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:51,880
years in jail and ten grand or 100

494
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:55,720
million dollars or maybe the prospect of

495
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,130
bankruptcy and losing your house and of

496
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,440
course who wins to the lawyers

497
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,600
they're all the ones that lawyers love

498
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,950
these kind of suits especially when it's

499
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,439
something like you know what I don't

500
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,669
like what that doctor did to me and the

501
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,110
Alberta College of Physicians the

502
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:09,610
surgeon says well that's fine you can

503
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,990
hate what the doctor did to you we're

504
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:14,040
just gonna tie up a lawyer fees until

505
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:17,500
you're bankrupt and that's not uncommon

506
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:20,830
so what can we do with with all of our

507
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,840
energy I like packing stuff right I

508
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,850
really do so that's why I get into

little snow balls move around North Pole

519
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:54,570
had been taken over by evil baddies etc

520
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:57,130
there's bug bounty programs CrowdStrike

522
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:02,890
making things fall over how cool is that

523
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:06,520

paid to weekend there's bug bounty

531
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,929
programs for all that my biggest advice

532
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,740
though is breaking out of those critical

533
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:28,270
or

534
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,730
those echo chambers do some critical

535
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:32,530
thinking so stop thinking that okay yeah

536
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:35,440
I've gotten my fourth or fifth letter

537
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:39,070
from Shaw that says I've been torrenting

538
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,630
movies well yeah they're not gonna do

539
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,909
anything to you until the day they do

540
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:45,970
that doesn't mean it's without teeth the

541
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:48,940
agreement that that the telcos in Canada

542
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:52,059
have with all these movie producers is

543
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,800
that they will say okay we've identified

544
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:56,500
that this person has been downloading

545
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,000
stuff they will send a letter so Shaw

546
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,760
will send a letter the movie studio sent

547
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,460
Shaw letter Shaw sends you a letter and

548
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,860
that letter says yeah quit it until at

549
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:09,370
some point when the movie studio says

550
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:11,409
yeah you I've decided I'm gonna do a

551
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:13,750
subpoena and it's not just the crown in

552
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:15,670
Canada who can make a subpoena for

553
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:18,700
evidence there's what's called an Anton

554
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:21,670
pillar order and any citizen can

555
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,830
subpoena evidence so the movie studio

556
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:25,800
can subpoena your computer from your

557
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:28,570
house and the police will go get it and

558
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,470
it's it's something we should be scared

559
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:34,540
about if that's the kind of activity

560
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:39,190
where we're taking part in because quite

561
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:42,580
frankly karma is a bit of a bit of a

562
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:45,010
thing the kid in Nova Scotia did that

563
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,980
the whole scenario sound familiar to

564
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:49,330
anybody anybody remember we've he did

565
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,340
the exact same thing with one of the

566
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:53,409
large telcos in the United States and he

567
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,600
actually went to jail for quite a while

568
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:58,380
the difference was well this kid lawyer

569
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,300
not pretty quickly and we've as a deck I

570
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,770
think we've got out after six years so

571
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,190
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in the

572
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:09,700
United States is significantly more more

573
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:11,620
scary than what we have in in Canada and

574
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:15,070
I remember actually there was a fella in

575
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:18,189
Russia who was convicted of running some

576
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,899
large spam botnet and he chose to be

577
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,429
tried in the United States and would

578
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,510
likely go to jail for 20 years in the

579
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:25,990
United States one of the ladies that

580
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:28,890
works for me works in in in my in my

581
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:31,030
team she's Russian and she's awesome she

582
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:33,220
immigrated to Canada about eight years

583
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,960
ago and she's got the thick accent and

584
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,760
she's the kind of lady who who when

585
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,410
walking through a park the birds would

586
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,000
land on her shoulder she's just so sweet

587
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:43,030
and I asked her well

588
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,790
I why would this happen why would this

589
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:48,070
guy choose to you know face these

590
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:50,830
charges in in the United States rather

591
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:55,899
than then than Russia she said oh and

592
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:56,889
Russia they would kill him what's the

593
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,380
worst that could happen

594
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:01,270
death I guess still have to be charged

595
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,980
in Canada or Australia or any of the

596
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:08,050
five eyes nations that aren't the United

597
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:09,880
States so in protecting our Canadian

598
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:12,310
infrastructure and connect protecting

599
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,860
the stuff that we do for our for our

600
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:19,090
clients for our companies for for our

601
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:20,560
our people again that that wiretap one

602
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,810
in particular was a real eye-opener for

603
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,129
me I encourage you to read the law

604
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:26,470

605

access to all of our laws Computer Fraud

609
