[Applause]

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,189
thanks Thomas for the introduction

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,518
well the crowd has probably reduced a

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,049
little bit but that's okay

5
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:15,599
many of you may be wondering why quantum

6
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,730
computing in a security conference I'll

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,680
talk about it but I hope it will read

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,020
you some of your minds give you a little

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,630
bit better perspective of a new field

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,039
altogether for me coming out of this

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,470
conference I'm a security guy by

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,880
profession though but talking about

13
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,420
quantum computing this is my past

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,430
research my passion good the state so we

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,870
will talk about why this presentation

16
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,840
and a security conference or maybe to

17
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,059
tickle your brains to understand we're

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,789
already going into the future I guess

19
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,440
it's all about the future you know we

20
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:50,399
learned from past we go into the future

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,070
right so I'll try my best

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,629
it's more of the presentation style is

23
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,829
more of you know picture says a thousand

24
00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:03,269
words so less of a content more of a

25
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:06,000
picture and a philosophy behind it

26
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,260
by the way Prashant again I work in

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,720
number I health services an IT security

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,049
architect 10 plus years of experience in

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,479
security the masters and bachelors back

30
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,850
from India and I have done a couple of

31
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,850
years of research in this field of

32
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,710
quantum computing if you google my name

33
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,619
you will find around for research papers

34
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,600
one of which is an MIT Boston quite a

35
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,250
long time back I've forgotten all the

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,720
mathematics so don't ask me questions if

37
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,100
there's any mathematics involved I mean

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,780
this is pretty much just tickling your

39
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,869
minds as to what this field is all about

40
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,750
I go by the name of Kai Farkas so that's

41
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:43,380
my handle on slack on the exact channel

42
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,030
we have here in Edmonton i I've made a

43
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,130
little bit of a change in the subject so

44
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,710
this is quantum computing a new paradigm

45
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,298
rather than computing with some security

46
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,220
ramifications because you know I thought

47
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,570
about it a little bit yes security is

48
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,920
important in this field and I'll talk

49
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,210
about it but I think this is more

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,939
general I got to give you an

51
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,100
introduction why this field is what it

52
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:07,619
is rather than talking the details on

53
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:09,720
what security is all about so why

54
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,550
quantum computing Chris Oh

55
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,840
her bender came to me when they were

56
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,770
starting this besides confer and they

57
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,680
said you know would like to speak

58
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,390
a topic I've done some security

59
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,220
engagements before what said yeah maybe

60
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,779
I can talk about quantum computing why

61
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,050
not I mean that's part of my research

62
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:28,920
but what tickled my brains was this moto

63
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,650
of the b-sides you know in general as

64
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,269
this was being discussed in the morning

65
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,490
right this is the goal of b-sides and

66
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,400
generates a community-driven in exercise

67
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,380
it's a you know it's a forum the goal is

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,390
to expand your spectrum of conversation

69
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,320
beyond the traditional confines of space

70
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,720
and time

71
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,310
that's quite a close to my my heart

72
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,710
space and time when it comes you know it

73
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,440
talks physics I love physics quantum

74
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,210
computing is marrying physics with

75
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,460
computer science I'm gonna talk about it

76
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,830
so I don't know how many of you I'm sure

77
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,990
everybody has learned physics in some

78
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,430
time in their life but physics in

79
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:07,200
general seems to be you know if some

80
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,490
philosophy or its thing out there there

81
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,589
are scientists who are doing it in the

82
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,760
background what's it in for me you know

83
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,700
what is it what the practical

84
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,739
implications of it are and Mary computer

85
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,619
science to it and this is a deadly field

86
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,240
of quantum computing which comes up

87
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,130
actually you of a of folks who are from

88
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:26,490
UFA would know there is actually a

89
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:28,950
world-famous nanotechnology research lab

90
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,150
out here in Edmonton now I'll give a

91
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,010
little bit of a difference what is

92
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,020
nanotechnology what is quantum computing

93
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,679
there's a slight difference but they

94
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:40,140
ultimately come down to that level where

95
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,010
normally you and me the very understand

96
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,540
life and science doesn't work there was

97
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,459
a very big scientist we were actually

98
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,470
having a chat and the lunch time with

99
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,000
some of my folks a great scientist in

100
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,400
this field of quantum mechanics and he

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,910
said if you're not confused by quantum

102
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,709
mechanics you have not understood it so

103
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,350
my goal here is to confuse you guys and

104
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,940
hopefully make it a little bit more

105
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,799
muddied water as to what this field is

106
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,170
about and see how it goes the other

107
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,880
thing I like of this border was it is

108
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,920
where conversations for the next big

109
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,750
things are happening so we are in

110
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,030
Edmonton you know Edmonton go Edmonton

111
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,709
go b-sides conference why not talk about

112
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,950
a field which is still in its nascent

113
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,480
phase there are some practical

114
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,169
applications of it so I'll talk about

115
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,169
that as well

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,250
let's do a little bit of a philosophy

117
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:32,190
called ridin physics

118
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:35,220
for those who are interested in it I'm

119
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:38,070
quite quite interested in you know how

120
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,110
physics tries to explain the world so I

121
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:44,070
don't know if you can understand who

122
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:47,310
this guy is from his here's Albert

123
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,780
Einstein and the probability of them

124
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,700
visiting unexpectedly is directly

125
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,849
proportional to how much you feel like

126
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:56,250
being left alone actually I got my wife

127
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,920
and kids to a to the airport today they

128
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,120
have gone home so I'm alone and

129
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,200
hopefully this statement doesn't come

130
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,060
true that they come back they'll be

131
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,740
coming back in a month's time because we

132
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,660
are living in classical physics I'll

133
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,670
talk about the Newtonian mechanics not

134
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,010
in quantum world where things can happen

135
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:14,040
right off the bat and you don't expect

136
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,120
it so kind of you know starting at a

137
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,450
humor

138
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,610
Einstein was actually one of the one of

139
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:23,070
the person who didn't like quantum

140
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:26,850
mechanics and he had a big debate with

141
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:28,349
this other guy Niels Bohr Niels Bohr and

142
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,510
he's called the father of quantum

143
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,480
mechanics

144
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:34,770
Einstein is called the father of

145
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,990
relativity if anybody has heard that

146
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,849
term before special relativity or

147
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,520
general theory of relativity the way

148
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,580
gravity works the way space-time is

149
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,900
curved can you even imagine at this

150
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:52,140
moment I'm looking at your past I'm not

151
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:56,909
looking at your present think it for a

152
00:05:52,140 --> 00:06:00,120
moment this light has gone to you and it

153
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:04,800
has traveled from you to me there's

154
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:07,040
certain time back when I'm looking at

155
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,040
you

156
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,540
things change philosophies change and

157
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:17,250
that's where Einstein said general

158
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:20,280
theory I believe in a true cause and a

159
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:22,590
true effect Niels Bohr said no maybe

160
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,570
that's not true so you know basically

161
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,869
Einstein said God does not play dice

162
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:30,990
with the universe there is no there is

163
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,160
no uncertainty in this world things need

164
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,320
to be certain

165
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,400
well Niels Bohr said no that doesn't

166
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,949
make sense you know quantum mechanics

167
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,979
is important and it's a field and there

168
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:43,690
are things which are uncertain until you

169
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:46,030
measure them so I'll talk about that a

170
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,039
little bit it's a very subtle philosophy

171
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:50,258
but the moment you understand it it kind

172
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:52,870
of rejects your brain and you know gets

173
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:54,310
you involved why are we in this world of

174
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,380
a VR you know the fact that I'm looking

175
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,850
at your past I'm looking at these stars

176
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,009
out there in the morning or in the

177
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,539
nighttime I'm actually looking at how

178
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:03,130
many billions of light years back in

179
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:05,349
time as you may have googled and you

180
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:08,500
have seen right they may not even exist

181
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:11,199
at this point of time from from where

182
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:14,620
the light has traveled and light is the

183
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,270
fastest in this the speed of light is

184
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:20,560
the fastest in this universe as we all

185
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:22,900
know that's a gain Einstein's postulate

186
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,010
of his general theory of relativity so

187
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,320
God does not play dice with the universe

188
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,150
actually Niels Bohr replied back to this

189
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,010
and he said not not only God plays dice

190
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:35,289
with the universe but he throws it in

191
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:36,969
areas where you cannot even see them but

192
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:39,550
another interesting code as Einstein

193
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,169
always used to say you know great

194
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,630
spirits have often encountered violent

195
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:45,698
opposition from mediocre minds so he

196
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,479
actually called Niels Bohr as a mediocre

197
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:49,210
binding

198
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,070
can you imagine that's how the rivalry

199
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:54,099
between scientists happen of two

200
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:57,699
different parts two different schools of

201
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:58,930
thought in science and I none is right

202
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:00,639
or wrong they have different

203
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,080
perspectives and I'll come to that but

204
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:09,430
they have very interesting perspectives

205
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:11,320
of how to look at the world one another

206
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,070
interesting code which always it keeps

207
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,900
my attention

208
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:21,789
reality is what is observed reality is

209
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:24,310
what it is think it for a moment you

210
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:27,669
have a tree out in a forest it is

211
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:32,799
existing out there you haven't seen it

212
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:35,770
it still exists Neil's forces know it

213
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,958
doesn't make any reality for you because

214
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:41,500
you haven't gone and observed it that it

215
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:45,579
is standing in up there I'm looking at

216
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,650
you you are a reality for me if you're

217
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:49,329
not there I mean it defies classical

218
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,140
thought yes people exist you know they

219
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,569
don't exist

220
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,930
that cannot see them but in the world of

221
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:58,020
atoms and molecules and particles this

222
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,609
actually becomes true and that's why

223
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,530
Niels Bohr succeeded in his theory of

224
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,270
quantum mechanics I'll give a little bit

225
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,800
of what it is then we'll come down to

226
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,170
computer science and why quantum

227
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:12,219
computing is taking off its roots okay

228
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:14,170
very interesting I mean it's it at the

229
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:17,580
end of the day when physics takes over

230
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:20,110
you no UV no physics chemistry biology

231
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,240
at certain point in time when you keep

232
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,250
thinking about it you move into the

233
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,320
world of metaphysics then you move into

234
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,120
the world of philosophy then you've

235
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,440
probably moving into the world of you

236
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,270
know the mass flows triangle if

237
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,250
everybody knows the massless triangle of

238
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,079
self-actualization I mean why am I

239
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,810
really there in this world what's my

240
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:40,630
purpose what am i observing is this all

241
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:44,099
reality or unreal am I gonna die someday

242
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,100
and what's gonna happen to me right

243
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:54,490
another interesting one I want to know

244
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:56,200
God's thoughts rest are details so he

245
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,110
was a great philosopher and you all know

246
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:05,860
equals to MC square one of the greatest

247
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:07,180
equations ever found by him is why it's

248
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,200
quite interesting you know I was

249
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,550
thinking about it when people were

250
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,160
taking a giving a presentation I mean

251
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,439
this is the pen right this pen has a

252
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,740
mass if anybody knows physics a mass

253
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,620
like it's a material right this material

254
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,750
can be changed into energy it can it can

255
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:26,440
be it can be absent at this point in

256
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:28,720
time and it all becomes energy that's

257
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,690
exactly how nuclear bombs work that's

258
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,370
how exactly how atomic bombs work the

259
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,690
theory of nuclear fission or nuclear

260
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,000
fission you know if you want to Google

261
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:39,490
around why hydrogen bomb is what it is

262
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,280
why an atomic bomb is what it is you're

263
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:45,010
basically changing matter into energy

264
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,120
the fact that that even exists the fact

265
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,220
that energy and matter are

266
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,260
interchangeable is fundamental and

267
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,850
that's what he said right so he wanted

268
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,830
to know why guards thoughts you know

269
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:56,380
what exactly is the reality and he

270
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,150
wasn't concerned how to project or how

271
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,770
to understand that reality and that's

272
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,579
exactly what quantum mechanics does it's

273
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,949
a theory

274
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:06,530
it's a model it may not necessarily

275
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:10,670
mean that it's reality in its of itself

276
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:13,610
but it can give you answers of the

277
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:15,680
reality or things you look at correctly

278
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,530
and that's why it's successful to this

279
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,959
date so there's a you know we all talk

280
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:22,699
about modeling theory there's a model

281
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,750
then there is reality how you model that

282
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:29,360
reality and how you how you can find

283
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:31,220
true answers to of that model of that

284
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,900
reality for example you know then that

285
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,910
model is correct special theory of

286
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:38,230
relativity quantum mechanics any Theory

287
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,230
you talk about okay

288
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,370
particle physics so back from quantum

289
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:46,820
mechanics into particle physics right

290
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:50,300
everything is made of atoms and proton

291
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:53,000
atoms and you know molecules you go a

292
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,599
step further down neutrons protons and

293
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,760
electrons you go one step further down

294
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,620
quarks and leptons you go one step

295
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,270
further down they call it the god

296
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,080
particle I don't know why they call it

297
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,170
the god particle

298
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:08,810
it's called neutrino and in the certain

299
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,280
lab out in Europe they actually have an

300
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,339
underground lever they collide different

301
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,530
particles together they claim to say

302
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,300
that they found the fundamental particle

303
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:20,420
which can explain everything but there's

304
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,459
a debate around it my point is this you

305
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,520
know if you look from the scale of a

306
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:29,090
nucleus or even you know we'll talk

307
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:31,520
about quarks and leptons do a scale of

308
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,350
an atom do you human being down to the

309
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,930
scale of a universe to the scale of

310
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:39,380
galaxies do you see like there is a

311
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:42,439
pattern emerging out of it that pattern

312
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,450
is what is in the microscopic scale can

313
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,990
be on the macroscopic scale and they are

314
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:49,310
actually mimicking each other

315
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,900
Newton was actually one day sitting on

316
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,780
his desk and somebody came and he was

317
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,250
making a model of the solar system

318
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,110
somebody said wow what a beautiful in a

319
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,330
perfect model of the solar system I'm

320
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,370
actually I'm at least I believe in God

321
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:03,680
so I'll speak in that terminology I'll

322
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,750
try to argue why why there is a super

323
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,670
power so he said so Newton was there he

324
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,500
said okay what a beautiful model of the

325
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:12,020
union of the solar system he said yeah

326
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,030
this is what I made think about the

327
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:17,220
solar system existing out there somebody

328
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:19,630
might have made it to the fact that

329
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,040
electron if you know electron it's a

330
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,080
negative particle right it's a negative

331
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,300
charge 10 to the minus 10 to the raise

332
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:28,750
of minus 19 coulomb with its electrical

333
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:31,959
charge even if you change 10 to the

334
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:35,530
minus 20 or minus 18 I mean you could

335
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:39,970
imagine do the zeros this universe

336
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:43,270
wouldn't exist the way you and me are

337
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,860
here will not exist just because of the

338
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:47,069
fact that you have changed slight

339
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:50,380
decimal in the charge of an electron

340
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:53,710
that's how precise this machinery of the

341
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,880
universe is working when Newton said I

342
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,530
could make this and you like this so

343
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,939
beautiful think about the solar system

344
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:01,480
of the universe somebody might have made

345
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:08,500
it or how perfect and how precise it's

346
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:11,530
going so particles right matter is made

347
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:16,360
of particles you have matter you have

348
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:19,000
atoms electrons nucleus and neutrons and

349
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,950
quarks the more deeper down you go the

350
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,450
more you find but what I imagine I mean

351
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:26,260
I'm not a particle theorist particle

352
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:28,780
physics physicist but at certain point

353
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,880
in time the particle nature of matter

354
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,770
will cease to exist and you will always

355
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,840
only have waves or energy in this in

356
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:37,300
this vacuum and that's what equal to MC

357
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,220
square is all about I'll just give you

358
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:44,430
an example of what an atom might look

359
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:44,430
like it's just a it's just a model

360
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:59,140
and this model speaks volumes actually

361
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:03,610
if you look carefully of what we are

362
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:05,680
looking at here we are looking at the

363
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:08,140
center of this atom which is the nucleus

364
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,609
they're looking at a cloud we are not

365
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,770
actually looking at the way you always

366
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:14,740
imagine an atom as electrons and protons

367
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:17,140
going around it this is what quantum

368
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:20,170
mechanics is you have a probability of

369
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:23,110
that electron somewhere in that location

370
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:26,319
of space but where it is you don't know

371
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:30,670
because our precision our understanding

372
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,290
breaks this is this is where you know if

373
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,390
you have hurt Isaac Newton right the

374
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,010
apple fell he said oh how come gravity

375
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:38,740
he doesn't exist or what this forces

376
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,970
which goes down and why not up and then

377
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,060
he came up with these three laws of

378
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:45,340
physics right then Newton's first law

379
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,800
second law and third law it vent along

380
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,900
for 200 years until nine spork' more the

381
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:55,449
quantum mechanical world came to a point

382
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:59,050
where this classical thought that action

383
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:02,290
and reaction force equals mass into

384
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:04,300
acceleration or that inertia a body does

385
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,530
not move until somebody Pat's it or

386
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:10,810
forces it to move that Todd breaks down

387
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:13,510
you come into the world where it is all

388
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:16,030
all haziness that there is probability

389
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,920
of things existing but things existing

390
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,350
of themselves is not a reality or

391
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,620
precise in nature so this is just an

392
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:25,570
example of how you can visualize an atom

393
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,100
from a quantum mechanical perspective

394
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,840
and this would be important because I'll

395
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:36,190
be talking about quantum computing so

396
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:37,870
why this probability is important hope

397
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,730
I'm making sense here and it's not going

398
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,350
over the board I'm just trying to you

399
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,240
know bring it down to a point where it

400
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,860
tickles mind and again gives you guys

401
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,720
idea you maybe you can go a little bit

402
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:50,800
more Google queries on what fun

403
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:54,430
computing is so Moore's Law how many of

404
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,579
you know what moves lies okay why is it

405
00:16:54,430 --> 00:17:00,219
called a law it's actually not a la it's

406
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:02,800
an empirical observation a law is always

407
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,950
precise and perfect garden mood who was

408
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,930
IBM's chairman in 1965 around 1960s

409
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,790
observed that the density of transistors

410
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:12,580
on a microchip or on a controller

411
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:14,740
doubles every two years it's precisely

412
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:21,250
18 months actually but every two years

413
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:23,319
if you extrapolate this law in time what

414
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,300
you will see that the number of

415
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,520
transistors will keep on doubling on a

416
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:30,850
microchip or a processor or controller

417
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:34,180
and how could they double on the same

418
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:35,800
space on or in the same area they have

419
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,870
to keep getting shorter and shorten

420
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,480
right they have to keep going smaller

421
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:43,899
and smaller to a point where it will

422
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:48,420
come that a transistor would have its

423
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:51,280
dimensions in the range of an atom and

424
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:53,470
when that happens you're not in the

425
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,350
world of classical physics or Newtonian

426
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:59,200
mechanics those zeros and ones don't

427
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:01,480
matter anymore I'm sure everybody know

428
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,670
if one is a 5-volt on an electrical wire

429
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,190
on us on a motherboard right like it's a

430
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:09,910
signal and a zero is a zero world right

431
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:14,200
this this certainty of either you have a

432
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:15,520
one or a zero breaks in that world of

433
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,540
quantum mechanics as we have been

434
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:22,030
telling that probability exists so moose

435
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,950
law is going to break someday I mean at

436
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,990
some point in time the transistors will

437
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:27,880
be appointed for an atom and then

438
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:31,690
different physics altogether takes over

439
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,400
and that physics will then drive quantum

440
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,410
computing which we'll talk about qubits

441
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,080
and whatnot make sense like you are at a

442
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:40,000
point and we are actually at that stage

443
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,520
we have not realized it yet but this

444
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,920
stage where you're moving closer closer

445
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,260
to nanometer micrometers nanometers you

446
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,060
know and even further down to the level

447
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,770
of so talked to Intel talk to AMD's of

448
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,810
the world they will tell you how small

449
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,639
the transistors are and these are the

450
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,379
building blocks of a computer right a

451
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,390
transistor is a 0 or a 1 right you

452
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:03,430
actually look at how the bits get

453
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:05,020
arranged in there so what is quantum

454
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:07,510
mechanics I'm gonna I've been talking

455
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:12,220
about it for for a while now but just a

456
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:14,710
quick overview it is a framework for the

457
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:18,070
development of physical theory so it's a

458
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:19,430
framework ok it's a model of reality not

459
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,290
reality in itself

460
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:24,510
it is not a complete physical theory in

461
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,490
its own right so it has its limitation

462
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,260
that it works in the field of atoms and

463
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,940
molecules then at certain point

464
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,280
Newtonian mechanics takes over which is

465
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,810
Isaac Newton's way of looking at things

466
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,780
those three laws I talked about right

467
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:40,080
inertia action and reaction force equals

468
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:42,030
mass into acceleration now where can

469
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,780
quantum mechanics come into play and

470
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:48,450
drive computing this is the beauty

471
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:51,540
beauty of marrying physics with computer

472
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:54,420
science now information theory with how

473
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,860
computers can get changed they have to

474
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,380
write if the Moore's law has to break

475
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,679
your hardware has to change your things

476
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,790
would have to be different so

477
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,380
application software operating systems

478
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,030
standard stuff right there will always

479
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,290
remain for an end-user to understand

480
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,480
what they're looking at I mean those

481
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:12,450
things would remain certain specific

482
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:15,360
rules of algorithms of generating you

483
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:18,210
know processing power of running the

484
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,280
show and the back end when you're your

485
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,740
density is so strong that there's no

486
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,200
mood law anymore will run would be run

487
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,050
by quantum mechanical rules atoms and

488
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,600
molecules qubits things talking in

489
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:33,450
probabilities so quantum mechanics has

490
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,100
for mathematical postulates which lay a

491
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,290
ground rules for our description of the

492
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,300
world and I'll talk about it basically

493
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:41,940
it's there there's those four

494
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:44,280
fundamental principles if you understand

495
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:47,610
them you can understand how this field

496
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,700
can run computing sciences and they're

497
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:51,629
quite interesting and very you know

498
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,250
counterintuitive as I said if you're not

499
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:57,620
confused by this field we have not

500
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,620
understood it as Niels Bohr said before

501
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:03,540
how successful is this field

502
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:05,880
unbelievably successful this is a

503
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,590
mathematical model of the world but

504
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,870
think about it like they're those brains

505
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,840
in 1930s and 40s created those

506
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,979
postulates they have been running

507
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,750
actually quantum mechanics I don't know

508
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,310
if you many of you know in in the world

509
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:20,100
of physics they're talking about theory

510
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:22,800
of everything I'm not sure that's true

511
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,030
again I'm at East so I understand human

512
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,560
beings may not understand here if

513
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:27,780
everything because we are part of the

514
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,879
same equation how can we understand

515
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:33,149
ourselves by our own self so it's a it's

516
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,879
a little bit of a oxymoron but

517
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:38,488
they say a theory of everything would

518
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:41,218
also need to have quantum mechanics as a

519
00:21:38,489 --> 00:21:45,059
component of it you cannot have atoms

520
00:21:41,219 --> 00:21:47,219
and electrons Union you cannot explain

521
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:50,009
them under the quantum mechanics is part

522
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:52,799
of it but quantum mechanics has not

523
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:57,080
explained everything of this world think

524
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,080
about gravity right I mean I had this

525
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:04,769
again again right you throw it it comes

526
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:06,749
down right this simple fact of something

527
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:09,809
going up and coming down which we all

528
00:22:06,749 --> 00:22:13,769
know as AI Newton said by Apple is

529
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:15,989
coming down not going up this gravity

530
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:19,950
cannot be explained by quantum mechanics

531
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:21,839
and this is a problem for scientists

532
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:23,580
these days they can understand a lot of

533
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:25,559
things but they cannot understand

534
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,658
gravity so theory of everything would

535
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:33,389
include something more than what quantum

536
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:34,950
mechanics tells us okay so and you know

537
00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:36,748
that they are talking about gravitons

538
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,609
they're talking about cake eons I mean

539
00:22:36,749 --> 00:22:42,239
these this is a it's a very fascinating

540
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:44,939
word if you know light as we all see

541
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:46,679
here is there's photons going back and

542
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:50,009
forth if you heard that term particle of

543
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,929
light is called a photon that they're

544
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:54,899
telling a particle of gravity is called

545
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:57,419
a graviton why gravity is just a force

546
00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:59,070
it could be a field with particles it

547
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:01,169
could be understood in that in the

548
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,059
nature of particle physics the way light

549
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:06,299
can be understood in the nature of

550
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:09,119
photons talk about cake eons it's a

551
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:11,369
conceptual concept but they said take

552
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:14,189
eons or particles which can run faster

553
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:15,779
than the speed of light and if that

554
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:18,629
happens I don't know how many of you

555
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:21,029
understand a hard special relativity if

556
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:24,199
you run faster than the speed of light

557
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:26,700
you can actually go back in time and

558
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,399
there's a grandfather's paradox you know

559
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,839
if if I can run back in time I kill my

560
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:32,459
grandfather then my father wouldn't be

561
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:37,609
born then I wouldn't be born but I'm

562
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:40,589
here so how is that possible so this

563
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:43,259
anyway there's a theory behind it but to

564
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:46,049
this date the postulate that light is

565
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:46,860
moving is the fastest speed in this

566
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:51,690
universe still

567
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:53,459
stance so quantum mechanics we talked

568
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:55,830
about it at length how does information

569
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,350
theory or computer science comes into

570
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,879
play so let's go top bottom up so

571
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,459
information theory you know you have

572
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,020
different if you have you have different

573
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,780
fields around it right yes classical

574
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,520
mechanics cryptography computer science

575
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,980
the Turing machines if you have been

576
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,720
into in into computer science as a

577
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,090
graduate curing machine then what they

578
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,610
actually mean Shannon's theorem of

579
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:20,760
information theory error correction etc

580
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:23,340
so this is standard computer science 101

581
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,410
you keep going up then you come into the

582
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,600
realm of quantum algorithms form

583
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:29,370
computer error correction in the world

584
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,530
of quantum you know quantum mechanics

585
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:33,780
and then you keep going up and you

586
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:35,610
actually are marrying the field of

587
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,990
information theory or computer science

588
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:39,059
with what you can actually do with

589
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:41,040
quantum mechanics at the end of the day

590
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:43,440
quantum mechanics is only providing you

591
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:46,200
the resources to do computation that's

592
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,030
all just like bits you know it's

593
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,370
electrical wire zeros and ones right

594
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:52,200
electrons up and down in a similar

595
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:54,330
fashion quantum mechanics is providing

596
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,549
you the resources you could use the

597
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:59,010
resources create your own quantum

598
00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:00,660
algorithms and then go after it they're

599
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:02,879
famous algorithms in quantum computing

600
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,830
to this day chars algorithm you can

601
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,540
actually break the RSA algorithm if you

602
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:10,620
have or RSA cryptography right we talked

603
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:13,320
about keys thousand 24 or 128 256 bit

604
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,760
RSA cryptography these can be broken in

605
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,970
the world of quantum computing and I'll

606
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:20,760
just tell you actually IBM created a

607
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:23,880
seven cubed quantum computer coding

608
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:28,500
qubits on top of molecules and they

609
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:29,940
factored 15 into five and three back so

610
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,440
these are prime numbers those who

611
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,480
understand cryptography right prime

612
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,630
numbers you can go one very easy it's

613
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,450
hard to refactor it back into prime they

614
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:41,429
did that the fact that it is 15 back

615
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,110
into five and three is probably not that

616
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:45,390
important but the fact that you could do

617
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:47,820
that is important because now you can

618
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:51,080
break RSA algorithm that this

619
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,080
computational method

620
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:59,900
so what is quantum informatics the basis

621
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,790
of information theory is discrete

622
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,370
mathematics binary digits as we all know

623
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:07,460
zeros and ones right quantum information

624
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:09,350
employs quantum states as basic elements

625
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,780
of information so we'll talk about those

626
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:14,570
what that states mean but I you know in

627
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:17,570
a term it's it's probability examples of

628
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:20,030
quantum bits or qubits are like nuclear

629
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:22,580
spin it could be motion of it trapped

630
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:25,850
ions it could be photons and in an

631
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:27,379
optical resonator each offers a future

632
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,600
technology for future computing

633
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:33,520
processing these are your resources

634
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:36,199
these things you can use to code

635
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,170
information in the form of qubits and

636
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,050
then do your mathematical algorithms on

637
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:43,790
that get the results out and lo and

638
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,960
behold you are breaking a lot of stuff

639
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:47,270
which currently exists or you're

640
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:53,240
creating new stuff which does not exist

641
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:55,160
even today so again the same thing in a

642
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,470
pictorial fashion but I'll show you a

643
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:06,980
little bit of a video you know what a

644
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:09,050
qubit might look like this is an example

645
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,510
of a photon going up and down up and

646
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:15,620
down up and down just an example of a

647
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:18,379
particle of light a light can be

648
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,300
measured in wave or in particle this is

649
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:23,360
a very famous principle but not both at

650
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:26,480
the same time either you are either you

651
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,540
are a matter or you are a wave but you

652
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,880
cannot be both does that make sense I

653
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:34,520
mean it's a little country but you know

654
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,750
either I'm a person or I'm invisible but

655
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:41,150
I cannot be bought at the same time

656
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:44,030
right so so this is an example of how a

657
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:46,250
quantum a qubit would look like a qubit

658
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:48,620
is not an electrical signal it's a

659
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:51,220
resource provided in the world of

660
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:55,010
quantum mechanics again ions photon

661
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:58,010
atoms electrons and they can be coded

662
00:27:55,010 --> 00:28:00,320
into these qubits again zeros and ones

663
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,610
the beautiful factories are now talked

664
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,520
about it's called the principle of

665
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:05,240
superposition you can actually have 0

666
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,970
and 1

667
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:15,110
the same time coded on that resource of

668
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:17,090
a Cuban it's not either/or it's both and

669
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,100
when you look at it we'll talk about

670
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:20,780
it's a problem of measurement then only

671
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,699
one I mean if I'm looking at you you are

672
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,320
there if I'm not looking at you you may

673
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,470
or may not be there that's what nice for

674
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,360
said right so but the moment I look at

675
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:38,150
you you you're there so you are a fact

676
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:41,000
for me some of the benefits which

677
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:42,740
quantum computing can provide so in

678
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,900
excess of quantum information is

679
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:47,120
inaccessible until converted into real

680
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,620
information via measurements a very

681
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,260
important fact and I'll come to that

682
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:53,300
there will be actually a a topic on

683
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:55,190
screwed injures cat paradox if anybody

684
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:59,750
remembers their physics again in quantum

685
00:28:55,190 --> 00:29:01,700
mechanics there was a cat paradox and it

686
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,920
offers security and quantum cryptography

687
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,930
and other sharing protocols guaranteed

688
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,880
by laws of physics rather than

689
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:12,170
assumptions of mathematical difficulty a

690
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:14,480
very fundamental statement here security

691
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:17,930
is never 100% as we all know right I

692
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,840
mean we could pay a lot of money to try

693
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:22,340
to secure ourselves or be you know lock

694
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,480
ourselves and try to be hundred percent

695
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,300
secure but they're always raised to

696
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,860
break it but that's ordering topography

697
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,480
you talk about mathematical difficulty

698
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,070
algorithms and you try to break them and

699
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,990
you cannot because your supercomputers

700
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:35,120
can do that today and so it's not

701
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:36,890
possible but in quantum cryptography

702
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,530
where actually I did my research and

703
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:41,180
back in Montreal my professor were

704
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:43,190
talking to us Brossard who is the father

705
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,020
of quantum cryptography he created a

706
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:46,370
protocol called BB 84 been adverse

707
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:49,340
ordinary for protocols we'll talk about

708
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:54,229
it it's a cryptographic protocol but the

709
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:56,929
fact that if it is secure hundred

710
00:29:54,230 --> 00:30:00,820
percent because it if it is not then

711
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:02,660
you're falsifying the law of physics and

712
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,280
I'll talk about it's called the

713
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,140
Heisenberg uncertainty principle and

714
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:09,170
that's actually a law of physics in

715
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:12,170
quantum mechanics if you so either you

716
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:13,940
go against a law which would be awesome

717
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:16,340
if you could break that will be you'll

718
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,900
be obviously famous tomorrow because now

719
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,918
you're not just famous in security but

720
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:23,029
you're famous in

721
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:25,519
- but you cannot break that law and

722
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:27,440
that's why you are you're you know you

723
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:30,889
can ensure that the security of this is

724
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,950
hundred-percent and entanglement of

725
00:30:30,889 --> 00:30:35,059
states makes some uncomputable problems

726
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:37,039
computable so we'll talk about

727
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:38,418
entanglement spooky action at a distance

728
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:42,049
anybody heard heard that term before

729
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:44,090
beam me up Scotty spooky action at a

730
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:46,249
distance we've talked about it I mean

731
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:47,988
it's so counterintuitive again but we'll

732
00:30:46,249 --> 00:30:50,359
talk about that the slides come but this

733
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:51,919
is a fact of reality it's it in fact

734
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:54,289
true and they have created an experiment

735
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,549
surround it scoring just cat parallax is

736
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:59,539
doctor squirrel injured or miss

737
00:30:55,549 --> 00:31:01,039
Willinger 1930s beautiful cat paradox so

738
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:03,499
there is actually a deaf nuclear modular

739
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,899
material out there so there's a particle

740
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:08,090
which can either get be emitted from

741
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:10,668
that nuclear call it a resonator a

742
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:13,158
nanometer for example our particle may

743
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:15,379
not be emitted from it now since it is

744
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:17,330
quantum mechanical in nature because the

745
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:20,238
particle is so small like it's a nuclear

746
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:22,279
material there's a probability of 50-50

747
00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:24,409
that it will send it or not send it

748
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:26,809
right the qubits zeros and ones can be

749
00:31:24,409 --> 00:31:28,940
at the same time on a machine so you cuz

750
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:30,350
you have it's in a box you're not seeing

751
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:33,590
it from outside you don't know what's

752
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:35,959
happening keep that in mind now that

753
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:38,980
particle has a 50/50 chance of being

754
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:42,139
emitted or not that could lead to

755
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:44,869
hitting a hammer that hammer hits a

756
00:31:42,139 --> 00:31:49,519
poisonous bottle that poison spills out

757
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:52,149
and the cat is dead or alive now the

758
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:55,820
paradox is I'm not looking at this box

759
00:31:52,149 --> 00:32:03,199
okay can I tell if the cat is alive or

760
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:05,689
dead I mean I cannot for me there is a

761
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,669
50/50 chance of cat being alive or dead

762
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:11,179
it's very hard to wrap your brain around

763
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:13,580
this idea but this is how this paradox

764
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:16,730
came into being now the moment I put big

765
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:18,529
I take the box out yeah I just she'll be

766
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:21,769
dead or she'll be alive for me she is a

767
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:24,679
reality now either it's a 0 or a 1 but

768
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:29,289
until I observed it it was 0 and 1 at

769
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,289
the same time does that make sense

770
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:36,208
and so that is how they claim that

771
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:39,089
quantum computing with qubits can do

772
00:32:36,209 --> 00:32:41,009
such a massive scale of processing even

773
00:32:39,089 --> 00:32:43,229
beyond supercomputers of starting to

774
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:45,319
somebody today I'm not sure if it is 128

775
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:48,989
bits or a thousand thirty four cubits

776
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:50,938
some of that one of that number but a

777
00:32:48,989 --> 00:32:53,189
safe thousand really for qubits

778
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:55,109
so talents to a fourth qubit quantum

779
00:32:53,189 --> 00:33:00,029
computer just thousand twenty-four

780
00:32:55,109 --> 00:33:02,968
qubits like one Meg can refer every atom

781
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:06,979
in the universe that's how large that

782
00:33:02,969 --> 00:33:09,449
computation it is and at the same time

783
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:12,469
because if I'm not observing what's

784
00:33:09,449 --> 00:33:14,849
happening inside that computer all the

785
00:33:12,469 --> 00:33:18,109
processing possibilities are there

786
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:21,089
however millions are there to raise 2024

787
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:22,918
the moment I look at it yes I will

788
00:33:21,089 --> 00:33:25,769
collapse it to do a state where I will

789
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:28,739
see something which is concrete but the

790
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:31,079
fact that I can run a computer in a

791
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:33,539
black box with certain algorithms on it

792
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:36,749
with possibilities of thousand 22 race

793
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:38,639
2024 at the same time as if like I'm

794
00:33:36,749 --> 00:33:40,499
referencing every atom in the universe

795
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:44,299
at the same time in that computer just

796
00:33:40,499 --> 00:33:44,299
one mega economy computer can do that

797
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:51,509
Heisenberg uncertainty principle

798
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:53,849
another beautiful principle so it so

799
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:54,599
look I am here right I'm standing in

800
00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:58,639
front of you

801
00:33:54,599 --> 00:34:01,408
my position is zero I'm straight and I

802
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:04,079
have no motion I mean you can exactly

803
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:06,569
tell that my what's my position and if

804
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,609
my moving or not this is because you and

805
00:34:06,569 --> 00:34:10,889
me can see each other we are part of the

806
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:13,889
Newton's world right this is classical

807
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:15,869
physics standard those three laws as

808
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:19,739
they apply in the world of quantum

809
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:22,919
mechanics doctor Heisenberg said if your

810
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:26,249
particle is so small that it is at level

811
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:28,918
of quantum mechanical rules then you can

812
00:34:26,248 --> 00:34:32,939
either look at its position or you can

813
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:38,129
look at its motion but not both at the

814
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:39,809
same time that's not possible and he

815
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:42,659
proved it and there are many experiments

816
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:45,210
which prove that and this is the concept

817
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:47,999
of non orthogonal I'll talk about it so

818
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:51,119
the fact that you can have this this

819
00:34:47,998 --> 00:34:52,939
principle actually ensures that quantum

820
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:57,299
cryptography is hundred percent secure

821
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:59,579
because look at if I'm if an alice is

822
00:34:57,299 --> 00:35:02,130
sending a qubit to bar up in a quantum

823
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:04,079
cryptographic Channel I'm not looking at

824
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:07,289
that qubit everything is flowing by the

825
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,630
moment a hacker or third person call it

826
00:35:07,289 --> 00:35:11,309
a man-in-the-middle attack is looking at

827
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:14,099
it to try to observe our intercepted

828
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:15,869
message you have broken its quantum

829
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:18,180
mechanical phase as I said in the

830
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:21,180
strangest paradox you've actually broken

831
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:23,519
its state it's not correct anymore it

832
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:25,078
may not be good for Alice or Bob it's

833
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:26,459
not neither good for me as a hacker

834
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:28,710
I may have denied that that

835
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,239
communication but I cannot intercept it

836
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,160
without interfering with it

837
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,799
that's how you can if you will be

838
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,200
breaking a law of physics if you're even

839
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:40,890
mentioning to try to look at that at

840
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,589
that channel so that's the beauty of of

841
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,759
Heisenberg uncertainty principle

842
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:47,690
ensuring that quantum cryptography will

843
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:47,690
be hundred percent secure

844
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:53,069
einstein-podolsky-rosen paradox

845
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:55,349
another beautiful paradigm the spooky

846
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:57,650
action at a distance you can have two

847
00:35:55,349 --> 00:36:01,230
particles at two ends of the universe

848
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:03,900
they will still talk to each other even

849
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:05,819
though the speed of light will probably

850
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,579
connect them after a long period of time

851
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:10,890
but they can instantaneously talk to

852
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:12,690
each other that's what Einstein and two

853
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,609
of these other folks talked about I'll

854
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:19,259
give you a small demonstration of this

855
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:23,299
again it's a video of what a EPR I'll

856
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:23,299
talk about it a little bit looks like

857
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:32,130
two particles the way it works again

858
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:35,250
from a little bit physics but you have

859
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:37,470
say one particle right this particle at

860
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,970
this point in time is just one it breaks

861
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:42,660
for some reason there's an internal

862
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:44,580
force it breaks it goes so far away the

863
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,290
initial momentum is zero right was

864
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,850
standing still right if anybody knows

865
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,500
physics the law of conservation of

866
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:52,049
momentum law of conservation of energy

867
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,340
and law of conservation of mass there

868
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,410
will always be conserved

869
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:58,080
it doesn't change there'll be only one

870
00:36:55,410 --> 00:37:00,330
energy and in a closed system there'll

871
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,180
be only one mass you can break it in how

872
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:06,330
many pieces so is motion momentum so a

873
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:09,870
particle breaks goes into two ends of

874
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:12,509
the universe still the law of momentum

875
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:14,400
will be correct that means if I takes it

876
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:16,620
momentum going there and it's there and

877
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,780
I plus them together it'll still be zero

878
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:20,339
because the initial momentum was zero it

879
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,430
was just standing still when it broke

880
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:27,060
apart so the final will be zero to now

881
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:30,660
Einstein said hmm if I say that particle

882
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:35,130
has a velocity of 50 kilometers per hour

883
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:36,870
going east I don't even have to look at

884
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:41,210
this particle to say it's going 50

885
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:41,210
kilometers an hour going best I

886
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:46,980
instantly guard that information because

887
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,430
that law has to remain valid even at the

888
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:54,450
ends of the universe and that's what

889
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:57,540
Einstein said Niels Bohr said no you

890
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:59,700
have so Einstein said this entity look

891
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:02,420
this is possible now I can look at its

892
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:06,720
position I can look at this particles

893
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:08,940
velocity or momentum and by knowing this

894
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,589
particles momentum I can infer what this

895
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:13,170
particles momentum is without even

896
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:14,340
looking at it now I have falsified your

897
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,950
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle

898
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:19,500
because I know this particles position

899
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:21,750
and momentum both does that make sense

900
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,640
I'm not looking at it I'm looking at the

901
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,500
other one but looking at that I can

902
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,509
infer this and so Niels Bohr said no

903
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,550
you're wrong they still are part of the

904
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:31,110
same quantum mechanical system you

905
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:34,330
actually have observed it you have

906
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:36,430
observed it and that's why you can see

907
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:37,930
you know that they are correct so there

908
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:39,759
was some debate again I'm not baby

909
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:42,819
correct factually as to what it is but

910
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,220
what I'm trying to say is he said look I

911
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,830
can do position and momentum by looking

912
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:49,000
at the other guy this is and the fact

913
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:52,150
that you can do it at the end of the

914
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,590
universe think about it like particle

915
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:56,680
the end of the universe if it even has

916
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:59,380
to make any change on its brother on the

917
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,790
other end what is the best way you can

918
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,800
do it you have to send a speed of light

919
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:04,540
a signal right they'll probably take

920
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,570
eons to go to the other end of the

921
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:08,830
universe but we are not doing that what

922
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:11,500
we are doing is just inferring that

923
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:13,330
based on the the under law of physics

924
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,040
this is called spooky action at a

925
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:17,049
distance and it is valid they have done

926
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,900
experiments and it actually happens so

927
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:21,910
this experiment led towards the concept

928
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:24,880
of entanglement which is another

929
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:26,500
resource of quantum computing and they

930
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,800
said well this is possible we could do

931
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,830
it

932
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:33,340
so three principles superposition non

933
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:35,700
orthogonality and entanglement based on

934
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:38,500
three fundamental laws of physics

935
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:41,470
scrutineers cat paradox Heisenberg

936
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,130
uncertainty principle and Einsteins EPR

937
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:45,009
paradox

938
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:47,770
they are the resources of quantum

939
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:50,890
computing you can actually use these as

940
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:53,020
resources code them on qubits create

941
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:55,170
quantum computers and run algorithms on

942
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,170
it

943
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,700
beam me up Scotty you know it feels like

944
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,950
science fiction

945
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,680
it may not be they've actually done an

946
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:08,290
experiment by which they have what they

947
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,629
call teleported the term is called

948
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:12,730
quantum teleportation they actually have

949
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:16,270
teleported a particle from one location

950
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:18,130
to another using the EPR paradox I was

951
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:20,500
just talking about and I will show you a

952
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:23,740
little demonstration of that in the

953
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:25,600
particle world now what stops something

954
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:28,209
from the particle world the commonly

955
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:31,150
that the human world it's probably time

956
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:33,700
if you can physically demonstrate

957
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:35,980
something happening in the matter you

958
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:38,259
may have to find ways how you can do it

959
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:40,420
at the human level or in the matter you

960
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,770
know at this level so you know

961
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:44,410
teleportation could be a reality

962
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:46,830
tomorrow it is what they do in the

963
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,830
quantum world

964
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:54,430
challenges so quantum cryptography has

965
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:56,829
been called has been achieved but

966
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:58,419
requires further development so again as

967
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:01,030
I said my professor with dr. teals

968
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:03,190
Brassard Banat Brossard 84 protocol if

969
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:06,339
you want to google it they have achieved

970
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:08,770
that to run cryptography I'm not sure

971
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:10,509
this was kind of a you know a

972
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:12,069
speculation but around in the year

973
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:14,170
around 2005 and I was doing my research

974
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:15,670
they claimed that the Department of

975
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:17,410
Defense in u.s. and couple of

976
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:19,510
universities actually had a running

977
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:21,970
quantum cryptography channel underground

978
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:23,710
where they were sharing information

979
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:26,290
it's just like you know internet came

980
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:29,920
into the world but it was already there

981
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:31,808
in the DoD world long long before and so

982
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,599
you never know you know they could be

983
00:41:31,809 --> 00:41:35,829
far far ahead in their technology and we

984
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:37,359
will only look when it comes into

985
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,470
fruition I will talk about some

986
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,089
practical implications of quantum

987
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:41,129
computing they are actually today and

988
00:41:40,089 --> 00:41:43,240
we'll talk about it

989
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:45,099
quantum computers are not yet developed

990
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,558
to a full extent their certain proof of

991
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:49,000
concepts identification of computing

992
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:50,380
problems for which quantum computing is

993
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,270
an advantage we need to know which

994
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,250
problems are there like factoring is one

995
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:55,690
problem they have solved char algorithm

996
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,430
is another problem cryptography is

997
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:59,020
another problem there are other

998
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:00,609
computational problems which they have

999
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,470
solved with quantum computing at least

1000
00:42:00,609 --> 00:42:04,390
in theory you need to put it into

1001
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:08,129
practice and who knows tomorrow it could

1002
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:10,540
be corn software and maybe quantum IT I

1003
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:11,950
don't know how would security look like

1004
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:14,049
in the world of quantum IP where

1005
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:16,419
everything is fuzzy where everything is

1006
00:42:14,049 --> 00:42:21,730
probable until it becomes reality when

1007
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:24,130
you see it just an example of the banner

1008
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:27,160
press or a default protocol Alice and

1009
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:28,930
Bob they send a signal over there's a

1010
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,299
full length of steps you need to take

1011
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:33,279
you need to measure that those particles

1012
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:35,470
on the Bob's and to try to decipher what

1013
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,609
Alice has sent but the fact as I was

1014
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,709
saying the fact that when you're

1015
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:40,450
communicating with it if a hacker goes

1016
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:41,770
inside it he's gonna break the law of

1017
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:43,990
physics he's gonna basically break the

1018
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,900
communication and break that that

1019
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:48,609
probability of of communication into you

1020
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:51,369
know what is real and that is not

1021
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:53,410
actually what was being sent so that's

1022
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:56,940
how they generate this cryptographic

1023
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:59,710
protocols just an example of it a

1024
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,400
breakthrough in common computing until I

1025
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:03,060
think the NT

1026
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,680
server I don't know if it's up and down

1027
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:08,170
so you never know

1028
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,149
gonna have a quantum ping and you would

1029
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:13,620
know I don't know if my server is up and

1030
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:13,620
down and delino over there I can ping it

1031
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:20,770
consider three aspects so these are the

1032
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:22,450
three aspects quantum cryptography from

1033
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:25,990
teleportation and quantum computing so

1034
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:29,529
an example of quantum cryptography how

1035
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:32,919
they generate two particles in a

1036
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:35,320
cryptographic world you see a electron

1037
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,990
going hitting an atom creating two of

1038
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,370
its brothers and they are now entangled

1039
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:41,080
with each other going at the ends of the

1040
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:43,540
universe so this is what entanglement is

1041
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:46,660
now using this entanglement you actually

1042
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:54,670
can create cryptographic channels and

1043
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:56,500
create algorithms around it quantum

1044
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:58,180
teleportation this is an experiment

1045
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:01,960
which was done which actually proved

1046
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:04,980
that a particle can be teleported from

1047
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:07,780
one position to another position you see

1048
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:09,820
there is a emitter of light so you will

1049
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:12,610
see a light coming out from there it'll

1050
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:14,910
go split into two so we'll let the video

1051
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,910
run

1052
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,609
those are two entangled pairs right as

1053
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:33,969
we have been talking about one of them

1054
00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:35,038
goes to the ends of of its of its

1055
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:37,499
measurement

1056
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,849
there's actually four entangled pairs

1057
00:44:37,499 --> 00:44:41,229
which are which are there so it's a

1058
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:50,829
little bit more complicated than a tube

1059
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:54,249
to qubit system so two of them the match

1060
00:44:50,829 --> 00:44:56,169
here of the pair's and they will be

1061
00:44:54,249 --> 00:44:58,509
measured at this point and by this

1062
00:44:56,169 --> 00:45:01,509
measurement I could tell as part of the

1063
00:44:58,509 --> 00:45:08,679
EPR paradox what that other particle is

1064
00:45:01,509 --> 00:45:10,239
doing and I could actually relay that

1065
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:13,179
this particle is coming at this position

1066
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:16,719
at this time and what would be its

1067
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:18,489
position what would be its momentum so

1068
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,889
you know just a pictorial representation

1069
00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:22,569
not going into too deep but they did

1070
00:45:20,889 --> 00:45:25,630
they have been experiments to prove this

1071
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:27,429
this theory quantum computation so when

1072
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:29,829
it coming back to computer science what

1073
00:45:27,429 --> 00:45:31,809
what is quantum computing doing in terms

1074
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:33,429
of creating practical applications so

1075
00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:37,599
they'll talk to talk about this but this

1076
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:40,989
picture here is off d-wave systems in

1077
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:43,179
Vancouver Burnaby they are a company in

1078
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:45,159
the market and this is the quantum

1079
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:47,259
computer they have existing in their lab

1080
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:48,639
you can actually do certain computations

1081
00:45:47,259 --> 00:45:50,889
on it what you can do I'm not sure

1082
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:53,439
haven't done a research on it but they

1083
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:57,449
claim to have a quantum computer with

1084
00:45:53,439 --> 00:45:59,769
some practical applications you can use

1085
00:45:57,449 --> 00:46:02,829
magic cue technologies is another

1086
00:45:59,769 --> 00:46:07,899
company out in East Coast u.s. they

1087
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:09,909
claim to have a condom cryptographic you

1088
00:46:07,899 --> 00:46:11,739
know channel created and you can have

1089
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:15,309
Alice and Bob and send information back

1090
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:16,869
and forth so you can google that too so

1091
00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:18,399
regarding devices in the field of

1092
00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:21,189
quantum computing what are we looking at

1093
00:46:18,399 --> 00:46:22,868
what kind of possibilities are existing

1094
00:46:21,189 --> 00:46:24,219
in this world right so we are in the

1095
00:46:22,869 --> 00:46:25,869
world of quantum communication or

1096
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:28,259
quantum cryptography I mean which is

1097
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:30,939
still known we're talking about BB 84

1098
00:46:28,259 --> 00:46:32,529
sending information back and forth not

1099
00:46:30,939 --> 00:46:35,109
breaking the protocol those things are

1100
00:46:32,529 --> 00:46:38,500
well understood in the world when you go

1101
00:46:35,109 --> 00:46:40,840
past think about fun of sensors widgets

1102
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,920
Oh sells quantum games and toys I mean I

1103
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,110
don't know I mean the world is open

1104
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,810
right you have these resources provided

1105
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:49,030
to you by this physical theory now it's

1106
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:51,040
up to you to find ways and means or

1107
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:53,770
innovation to look at what you can do I

1108
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,020
mean there even the fact theoretically

1109
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:57,850
that you can solve certain computational

1110
00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:01,380
problems in computer science using this

1111
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:01,380
is it's fascinating

1112
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:10,120
ENIAC 1946 everybody you probably have

1113
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:12,790
seen this picture before right the the

1114
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:15,549
father of computer science computers for

1115
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:17,920
example such a big machine what we have

1116
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:21,610
today is all you know a same example in

1117
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:24,340
a phone right this is the one name in

1118
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:26,470
architecture basically you just have an

1119
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:28,000
output and input and a processor running

1120
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:31,149
in the background with the memory that's

1121
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,970
exactly what this machine was doing we

1122
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:37,630
have come within what 50 60 years at the

1123
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:41,620
most from that to this imagine this is a

1124
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:43,960
quantum computing lab currently within

1125
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:46,900
the next 30 to 40 years what could have

1126
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,850
happened you know you or we all know we

1127
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,470
are in IT how fast this world is going

1128
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:51,730
right from 2000 where I didn't even have

1129
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:53,350
an iPhone I didn't know what an iPhone

1130
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:54,880
is do today I can't live with this

1131
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:58,750
without this right it's been like 18

1132
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:03,250
years and now you would have you would

1133
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:05,320
have something which you can use example

1134
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:08,890
from IBM the seven qubit quantum

1135
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:10,420
computer I was talking about 15 changed

1136
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:13,120
into five and three the fact that you

1137
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:16,030
can refactor back a prime number into

1138
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:18,220
prime factors as I said you know there

1139
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:20,110
are possibilities to break RSA algorithm

1140
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:22,870
or you know those kind of cryptography

1141
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:24,670
protocols because they're based on the

1142
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:28,569
mathematical difficulty of something

1143
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:30,010
happening ion trap quantum computing

1144
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:34,480
they're working on in Simon Fraser

1145
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:40,510
University out in West Coast on using

1146
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:44,470
ions to do do do foreign computing this

1147
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:46,120
is the d-wave system so they have that

1148
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:48,700
one was an old picture this is a new one

1149
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:50,500
they have this in their lab so this is a

1150
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,879
reality you just want to show you that

1151
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,519
this is not

1152
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:57,460
you know this is not Puri anymore there

1153
00:48:54,519 --> 00:48:59,649
are some practical implications and the

1154
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:01,269
fact that we will be moving towards it

1155
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:03,009
there is no other way unless you want to

1156
00:49:01,269 --> 00:49:04,269
have more faster computers you've got to

1157
00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:06,549
have transistors you've got to have

1158
00:49:04,269 --> 00:49:08,470
systems much faster you are ultimately

1159
00:49:06,549 --> 00:49:10,390
moving towards the speed of light you're

1160
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:12,848
ultimately moving towards that mini rich

1161
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:15,430
mini miniaturization of of devices that

1162
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:18,420
these things will come into reality one

1163
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:21,868
way or the other right

1164
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:25,059
google has a quantum error correction a

1165
00:49:21,869 --> 00:49:26,470
chip you got I don't know how many chips

1166
00:49:25,059 --> 00:49:27,880
are how many qubits are there nine

1167
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:30,549
cubits you actually have those nine

1168
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:33,609
qubit they created this chip these nine

1169
00:49:30,549 --> 00:49:37,150
cubits talk to each other and they

1170
00:49:33,609 --> 00:49:40,000
correct each other's errors so if I'm a

1171
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:42,369
1 even the qubit is not a 1 at one time

1172
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,950
you're 0 & 1 the other party is a zero

1173
00:49:42,369 --> 00:49:46,690
and it's supposed to be a 1 I will do

1174
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:48,609
coherence with it that's because you're

1175
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:50,859
closer to it you can influence its state

1176
00:49:48,609 --> 00:49:53,980
and I will correct it back to its normal

1177
00:49:50,859 --> 00:49:55,799
state which is the correct one think

1178
00:49:53,980 --> 00:50:00,039
about it you're you're correcting errors

1179
00:49:55,799 --> 00:50:03,660
using qubits now this is stored you can

1180
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:03,660
do it in a communication channel to

1181
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:09,130
quantum random number generator this

1182
00:50:07,509 --> 00:50:10,809
could be a reality I guess it's a

1183
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:13,329
reality I'm not sure how true this

1184
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:16,539
picture is I took it from Google but you

1185
00:50:13,329 --> 00:50:18,009
know just like there's no real random

1186
00:50:16,539 --> 00:50:19,690
number generator in the computer science

1187
00:50:18,009 --> 00:50:21,970
like in normal computer as we all know

1188
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:25,029
right this is classical physics this not

1189
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:27,819
there's no know for 100% randomness out

1190
00:50:25,029 --> 00:50:30,009
there you are using some clock cycles

1191
00:50:27,819 --> 00:50:31,630
you're using something of the electrical

1192
00:50:30,009 --> 00:50:33,700
signals to try to create random number

1193
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:37,480
generators but in the world of quantum

1194
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:39,220
mechanics as we all see the scrutineers

1195
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,710
paradox and the fact that you will

1196
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:44,500
always have randomness until you measure

1197
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:47,859
it you actually could have a real random

1198
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:51,269
number generator application through a

1199
00:50:47,859 --> 00:50:51,269
quantum computing device

1200
00:50:54,730 --> 00:51:01,309
atomic clocks another big one right you

1201
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:04,160
can actually have clocks as we all know

1202
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:05,779
these clocks again have you know some

1203
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,359
error existing because these are

1204
00:51:05,779 --> 00:51:09,829
classical clocks the moment you go in

1205
00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:12,769
the world of atoms the precision

1206
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:14,299
increases the the moment the precision

1207
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:16,910
increases you can actually have clocks

1208
00:51:14,299 --> 00:51:19,250
which are very very correct I don't know

1209
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:21,470
if they can ever be 100% or

1210
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:23,200
fundamentally correct but you know you

1211
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:28,910
can increase that precision to a point

1212
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:30,319
so that's another application stability

1213
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:37,069
equivalent to losing less than one

1214
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:38,420
second in 300 years that's the end of my

1215
00:51:37,069 --> 00:51:42,200
presentation I like this vision

1216
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:44,509
Churchill as a coat you know it keeps me

1217
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,009
reminded right now this is not the end

1218
00:51:44,509 --> 00:51:48,500
it is not even the beginning of the end

1219
00:51:46,009 --> 00:51:52,700
but it is perhaps the end of the

1220
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:54,650
beginning we have just ended a concept

1221
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:58,609
moving into an unchartered territory

1222
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:59,599
where the possibility is open so thank

1223
00:51:58,609 --> 00:52:01,590
you very much for your time and

1224
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:06,619
attention I hope it was good

1225
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:06,619
[Applause]
