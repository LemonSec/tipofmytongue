[Applause]

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:10,940
so thank you very much for being part of

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:15,030
see so panel so the panel title is C so

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:17,730
panel modern security challenges so as

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,549
Thomas Matthews introduced you know

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,740
Robert Martin Michael L guar Cody ma and

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,869
handyman C I would like to give

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:30,778
opportunity to introduce yourself in

9
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:32,040
detail let's start with Robert Robert

10
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,329
Merton I'm the CEO at Albert Health

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,579
Services I've been at HHS for pushing 11

12
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,950
years now came out of the consulting

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,480
world before that so I was saying that I

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,399
know probably a third of the people in

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,989
this room from the fact that we've

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,960
worked together in various context

17
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:53,010
before that and and so I've been in

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,350
security since 1996 and if you have a

19
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,858
good few minutes after this we'll give

20
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:06,030
you my my first story around security

21
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:08,220
consulting and my name is Michael Dwyer

22
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,570
and I'm with the government of Alberta

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,510
and I've been with the government for

24
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,490
two years before that I was with at co

25
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,040
and M bridge previously in various

26
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,110
security roles you can check my LinkedIn

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,710
profile if you really interested but

28
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,710
probably

29
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:32,900
testing testing Gordy Maude University

30
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,270
of Alberta I've had the absolute

31
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:38,060
privilege and honor of working with

32
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:42,740
everyone here and either directly or

33
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:44,690
indirectly and we do value the ability

34
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,149
to network and share with our cohort and

35
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,610
I see that it's great that that people

36
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,850
are also doing doing this even as we

37
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,460
speak

38
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:55,600
and don't underestimate the power in the

39
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:58,820
value and networking

40
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,679
I'm handyman's iam would the City of

41
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,350
Edmonton and I've only been there for a

42
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:07,100
couple of months but I've been in the

43
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:08,899
industry for 28 or so years way back

44
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:14,810
when you remember those from tapes you

45
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:16,580
would see on mainframes it's a real

46
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:20,450
privilege to be here and I actually

47
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:22,520
recognize a lot of the faces it kinda

48
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,940
really reminds me of how a smaller

49
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:28,459
community this is and and thanks to to

50
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,310
the few people that really put in a lot

51
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:44,269
of effort making first side first

52
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:47,450
besides and I meant in reality so I

53
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:50,239
would like to give a disclaimer as a UFA

54
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,070
employee and these questions are coming

55
00:02:50,239 --> 00:03:01,310
from me as a security professional not

56
00:02:52,070 --> 00:03:04,700
as you have a employ so my first

57
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:07,340
question is how are your organization's

58
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,100
staying on the top of current risk when

59
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:20,049
every week something new is discovered

60
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:23,829
that demands your attention you can't be

61
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:26,989
concerned about the the latest name of

62
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:28,910
ransomware attack or the latest IOT

63
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:31,130
vulnerability I think we should do is

64
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:34,370
put in place practices and processes so

65
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:37,040
that you are you're able to to deal with

66
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,150
whatever comes your way and and then

67
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,459
also recognize that

68
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:43,849
that you're never going to be secure a

69
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:46,970
hundred percent you can do everything

70
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:48,768
you can to to react as well as possible

71
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:52,069
but I think that incident response and

72
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:54,709
that ability to to figure out how to to

73
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:57,530
stop an incident from happening is is as

74
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:59,000
important as the work and making sure

75
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:03,230
that you have the controls in place at

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,989
the start yeah Michael Cox I love to

77
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:08,810
just echo what was just said from my

78
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:10,760
perspective it's really about having the

79
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,180
right procedures in place before

80
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:16,728
something happens most of most of what

81
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,280
you hear in the news can be taken care

82
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:20,779
of with having a good process a good set

83
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,570
of people doing good work in the

84
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:25,400
background by the time you hear it in

85
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,409
the news I generally have a second

86
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,909
problem it's not how to deal with it

87
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,770
because I know we have good people in

88
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,289
place and it's probably dealt with the

89
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,060
larger problem for me becomes responding

90
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:36,770
to all of the questions from within the

91
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,780
organization because when people hear

92
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,099
about these things in the news the first

93
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,989
thing they do is they'll call the seaso

94
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:43,699
and say I hope this isn't happening here

95
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,340
right don't tell me everything's okay

96
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:48,500
and and so when you have good people and

97
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:54,440
good process behind the scenes you can

98
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:56,870
tell them that similarly and and again

99
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,800
as has been echoed because it's not

100
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:02,990
practical to be able to to keep abreast

101
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,599
of all the latest and greatest so it's

102
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:08,510
it's absolutely crucial that that you do

103
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:10,099
have a sole security posture and it's

104
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,169
interesting I was involved in a

105
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:14,060
presentation recently where where some

106
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:16,490
of the theme was was um

107
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,010
same as it ever was yeah that the song

108
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:22,699
from the Talking Heads Big Bird and the

109
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:25,580
dads to say some of the the very similar

110
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:27,560
exploits and exposures from the ten

111
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,570
years ago from - 20 years ago we're

112
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,599
still dealing with those today and so

113
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,130
that again likens to what what the two

114
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:36,169
colleagues mentioned about insuring and

115
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:39,260
that you have that adequate posture and

116
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:42,740
that now it's it's no longer a matter of

117
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,760
if it's definitely when and and so you

118
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,940
absolutely need to have that

119
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,000
recoverability and

120
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:51,370
similarly we have to try to deploy more

121
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,490
of a holistic viewpoint so where

122
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,170
previously it's very myopic like one

123
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,740
simple example is is that your network

124
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:01,660
team for example may see some traffic

125
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,360
traffic analysis and we're not from the

126
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:07,540
master an IP or a specific range of IPs

127
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,310
and so don't see that in events of

128
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,440
itself and then you're auditing access

129
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:13,270
management people make me see a huge

130
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,060
number of unsuccessful Maugham attempts

131
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:18,609
and again that that previously would be

132
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:22,750
in that silo and then your database

133
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:25,840
people may see some excessive amounts of

134
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:28,270
exfiltration would be a file sizes or

135
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,239
file types or pietatis sessions or not

136
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:33,010
and and so so where it's crucial now for

137
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,170
for effective response is to have that

138
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:38,740
holistic approach whereas when you can

139
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:39,100
piece piece that that entire picture

140
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,620
together

141
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,650
it can give you the ability to in a more

142
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:47,920
timely fashion actually address and

143
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:49,960
sorry with respect to to again try and

144
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,840
address the impracticality of everything

145
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,549
that's new and latest greatest don't

146
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,619
feel too too proud to acknowledge that

147
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,560
that's difficult in software and again

148
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,870
leverage from whatever sources we wait a

149
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,280
döner see fully leverage from from

150
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,290
colleagues from from from other

151
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,989
universities leverage from from whatever

152
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:11,230
sources within and and from professional

153
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,180
sources as well hany I I would say the

154
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,310
same as what's already been said I would

155
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,080
say that it's a matter of looking at

156
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,970
things from a risk-based approach and

157
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,940
and not all risks

158
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:24,160
demand the same level of response but I

159
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:27,219
would say that when we look at things we

160
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,530
look at what are our material assets and

161
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,530
so I react accordingly if I have

162
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:34,390
something that's less material I think

163
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,710
you know probably a different approach

164
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:38,710
as if I have something that's very very

165
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:41,680
material to the organization the other

166
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:44,770
thing is I think it's in preparedness

167
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,710
and so that preparedness requires that

168
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,930
you're not reacting but your your your

169
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,940
thinking planning while in advance

170
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,370
you're identifying what your key

171
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,340
controls are and really getting those

172
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,550
controls

173
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:01,070
and and really stabilizing them as it's

174
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:03,200
already been said it's not just a

175
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,760
technology it's it's you want to make

176
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,740
sure that you have your people you have

177
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,680
your process and yes there's this thing

178
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:12,700
called technology but you get it all

179
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:15,770
fully implemented fully operationally

180
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,270
you know operationally implemented and

181
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,130
then you have measures to know that

182
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:23,030
things are the way that they need to be

183
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:28,580
and then that preparedness also means

184
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:31,849
that you have a way of responding okay

185
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:35,478
thank you so we heard like lots of gdpr

186
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:38,450
in lately you know in the news so how

187
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,550
have new regulations with a global

188
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,560
impact like GDP are impacted your

189
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:49,010
organization let's start with you sure

190
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:50,900
sure so directly in my scope but it's

191
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:54,280
something that we're always kind of

192
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:56,300
watching out for any any third-party

193
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,160
requirements any legislative

194
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,530
requirements are always things that

195
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,680
you're very mindful of and and you're

196
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:05,990
trying to respond to each of them but

197
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,459
but really the way that that I like to

198
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:11,390
look at it is it's a risk based approach

199
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:15,260
yet again if I do the right things I

200
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:18,530
will by default start to comply to a lot

201
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:20,870
of those those requirements so we do

202
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,540
those right things we manage things from

203
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:26,450
a risk-based approach and then naturally

204
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,459
compliance will start to happen but one

205
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:32,230
offs are in my mind not a very

206
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:35,089
cost-effective way to to go after

207
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:37,430
compliance mandates so I don't do

208
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:39,860
something for gdpr that's completely

209
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:41,300
different from PCI that's completely

210
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,920
different from how we protect critical

211
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:48,859
infrastructure for example okay Gordy

212
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:51,979
with respect to the university in scope

213
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:55,370
of GDP are we've we've assessed some of

214
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:58,190
the primary criteria so for instance we

215
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,820
do have physical presence in EU Member

216
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:03,150
States

217
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,830
the in Italy there's the Cortona The

218
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:09,480
Bachelor of Arts program for example and

219
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:12,330
secondly we we don't actively target or

220
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,000
market to EU citizens with respects to

221
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:17,730
the sale of our sales our goods and then

222
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,760
thirdly we do conduct some form of

223
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:23,820
automated decision-making based on on

224
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:28,319
personal information of the eg citizens

225
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:31,200
so Fiat Fiat customizing your web

226
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,860
experience or or if you're applying and

227
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,740
there's a Auto evaluation based based on

228
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,150
your grades or not so so there is that

229
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,220
there are some touch points set of scope

230
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,680
and then so exactly as that handy

231
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,140
mentioned now now what's the risk what's

232
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,630
the risk to detainee emergency and to EU

233
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,000
citizens and and what respected

234
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:54,120
legislation so we're we're getting a a

235
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,750
sense of the magnitude so the number of

236
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,790
EU EU citizens we have in our faculty

237
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:03,150
staff or students and and again in

238
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:05,490
relation to to the amounts of activity

239
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:07,680
with with those few physical locations

240
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,690
and then so based based on the risk

241
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,469
approach that's that's gonna inform our

242
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:15,720
our to tactics and in our strategy to

243
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:19,040
ensure that that were what the combines

244
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,190
in a appropriate commensurate means

245
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,430
Michael

246
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:25,050
so for us we started looking at GDP are

247
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,969
a number of months ago just like

248
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,400
everybody did we started panicking just

249
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:33,180
when everybody started panicking and and

250
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:36,030
and we looked at it from from two

251
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,250
perspectives so there's the regulatory

252
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:40,610
perspective and the question we had to

253
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:43,680
answer there was does this apply to us

254
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:47,190
are these are these rules applicable and

255
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,620
enforceable here and to our employees

256
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,150
and the other side was more what I was

257
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,490
involved in which was do we have the

258
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:56,069
controls in place to support those

259
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,710
regulatory requirements if they are in

260
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:00,120
fact requirements so our office went

261
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,730
through an exercise of going through and

262
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,090
saying okay well if if worst-case

263
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:07,390
scenario mm-hmm it applies how does that

264
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,190
impact us and

265
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,020
and as the province of course we have a

266
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,790
number of people so I'll just give you

267
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,220
one example that was brought up if a

268
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,770
European Union citizen visits Alberta

269
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,070
and and has a problem and ends up in the

270
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,850
hospital for example or somewhere else

271
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:24,340
interfaces with the government in some

272
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,380
way we generate records on them and then

273
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,660
the question was well will we have the

274
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,610
controls in place in those systems in

275
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,010
order to fulfill the requirements of the

276
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,830
use so to make a long story short as I

277
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:38,680
can we do have those controls in place

278
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:40,960
and so we've we're able if if it's

279
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,359
applicable to us we're able to respond

280
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,040
the question of whether it's applicable

281
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,280
or not is still being handled by the

282
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,219
appropriate legal authorities who are

283
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:53,439
coming up with answers there we kind of

284
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,980
broken into him I just handled our piece

285
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,750
oh yeah so a gortney second point I

286
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,210
think was whether or not we're marketing

287
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,820
services to EU citizens and our legal

288
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:07,510
counsel determined that we are not

289
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:10,330
actively marketing to to EU citizens so

290
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:16,569
the gdpr didn't apply you know somebody

291
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:19,060
comes to Alberta two breaks their leg

292
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,070
and goes into a hospital we're certainly

293
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,660
going to give them the services but we

294
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,910
didn't think that there was any any

295
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:27,660
particularly additional controls that we

296
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:34,780
needed to apply because of gdpr and we

297
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:37,240
we have lots of controls thank you

298
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:40,270
so as a security professional I think

299
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,520
security awareness is really important

300
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:44,610
so what do you think the affective

301
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:50,500
components of information security

302
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:54,040
awareness program should be so so they

303
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:58,920
can open by saying that the the biggest

304
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,920
threat to any organization is the

305
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,130
organization and that doesn't mean that

306
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,770
people are bad or malicious or stupid it

307
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:07,300
just means that people do things and and

308
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:10,199
and you have to give them permissions to

309
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:12,400
do work and if those things go bad

310
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,250
things are or they're compromised you

311
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,640
look at any almost any of the large

312
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:19,010
publicized breaches in the

313
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,780
probably three or four years they all

314
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:23,390
started with some sort of compromise of

315
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,160
the individual yeah and so from a

316
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,750
security awareness perspective I think

317
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,819
there's there's really two ways to look

318
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:32,120
at it one is to do as much as you can to

319
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,740
educate and inform try to find ways of

320
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,950
getting those individuals to understand

321
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,700
that this is important to them in their

322
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,590
professional life but also in their

323
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,780
personal life so we've for years we've

324
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:43,430
tried to put things in place that helped

325
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,319
them at home or help them with their

326
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,030
kids or help them with their parents so

327
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,190
that they understand this is applicable

328
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:51,980
to them not just in a professional

329
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:54,530
context but then the second point is

330
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:57,100
that understanding that there's going to

331
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,100
be problems

332
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:04,640
Mike yeah we've come to much the same

333
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:07,280
conclusion about focusing on people as

334
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,010
as they're the most likely vector right

335
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:13,130
now for problems in our environment but

336
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:16,280
and kind of stole my thunder a little

337
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:18,470
bit but we've we've also come to the

338
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,720
conclusion that simply focusing on

339
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,850
security for individuals at work doing

340
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,910
their jobs is not something that that

341
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:28,490
people tend to consume voraciously and

342
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:32,290
actively and so in order to entice them

343
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:34,520
to to get the message we package it with

344
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,530
what they can do at home what they can

345
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,810
do for their children so that basically

346
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:40,910
there there's a reason to bring them out

347
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:42,290
or to to have them start reading and

348
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,199
consuming the stuff instead of just

349
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:49,459
another one of them at the the required

350
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:53,240
trainings III heard that geo a try

351
00:15:49,460 --> 00:16:03,010
fishing employees and then educate we do

352
00:15:53,240 --> 00:16:06,350
have but we've tried very hard to make

353
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:07,520
not make it a punitive exercise okay and

354
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,740
I think that's important because people

355
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,910
don't need another slap in the back of

356
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:15,380
the head for doing something wrong oh

357
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:17,810
yeah we've-- yeah we've-- really we we

358
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:20,000
took a we made a strong point to not

359
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,699
turn this into a if you get caught you

360
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,020
know big red light and an email goes to

361
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,670
your boss saying you need to go for

362
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:32,149
remedial training

363
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:33,979
that's not approach that's just advocate

364
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:36,170
different angle from from the University

365
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:40,070
and because we're robbing my core or

366
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:42,410
bang on we're we're actually trying to

367
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,959
assess how how to make our existing

368
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:47,329
training more effective and that is to

369
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:50,599
say since we've deployed quote/unquote

370
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:52,790
mandatory training we have the recourse

371
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,639
now when we're doing reach management to

372
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:59,509
see if said employee

373
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:01,639
did indeed fulfill and comply with their

374
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:03,740
crimes and and and pretty much all the

375
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,270
cases that they have so so what is that

376
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,510
saying what is the training I'm actually

377
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:10,099
buying us so yeah so we're trying to

378
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:12,439
develop other other types of measures

379
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:15,649
and trying to determine how we need to

380
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:17,419
augment our existing training and also

381
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,750
to the point that that Michael makes we

382
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:23,270
want to to focus on on the learning

383
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,369
opportunities so for example if you're

384
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,889
failing the email phishing testing then

385
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:29,840
then there be some some learning

386
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,220
opportunity but but we also want to

387
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,480
leverage from from from all angles of

388
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,280
learner opportunity so so even if you

389
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,330
you're successful in an email phishing

390
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,549
testing there's there's still

391
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,290
opportunity to further communicate and

392
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:40,820
also let them know you know great

393
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,460
there's a test you could you pass but

394
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,168
here's some other things to know thing

395
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,059
yep thank you honey

396
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:49,429
I would agree with with what's been said

397
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:50,750
so we talked about key controls or I

398
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:53,960
thought the key controls a little bit

399
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:56,270
earlier and and for us awareness is such

400
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,860
a control it's very much a key control

401
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:03,950
and if you look at how how employees

402
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:06,678
work today with with devices that are

403
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,570
mobile with with access anywhere and

404
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:09,919
even even when we look at some of the

405
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,439
assets and the fact that they're no

406
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,500
longer on-premise some of those assets

407
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:18,140
are now elsewhere it becomes very very

408
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,450
important to educate people as to what

409
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,730
to do what not to do

410
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:25,429
signs for one thing seem that they're

411
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:28,309
off and a big part of that is is is

412
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:30,230
awareness and and we take it for

413
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:32,000
multiple approaches there's awareness

414
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,520
that we would do for an end user as

415
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,410
they're being on on-boarded there is

416
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,730
awareness that we would do

417
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,500
people with administrative access

418
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,330
because of the level of privilege that

419
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,420
they have and the potential of what they

420
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:47,120
could do to a system as well as training

421
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,860
that we would do for for executives

422
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,840
because of the kind of access that they

423
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,760
have and the authority that they have to

424
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,100
be able to make decisions that could

425
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,950
impact potentially systems but but I

426
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:01,219
would say going back to some of the some

427
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:03,850
of what I've heard what I prefer the

428
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:11,090
most is is when we educate our employees

429
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:13,969
of how to protect themselves at home I

430
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:17,000
think the same question like the City of

431
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:19,640
Edmonton is doing something different

432
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,500
for the people like general public for

433
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,110
security awareness cyber security

434
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,750
awareness well so in in the two months

435
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:29,719
that I've been there we're in the

436
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,710
process of planning that that hasn't

437
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,510
quite started yet

438
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,730
okay takes a little bit of time to get

439
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,770
those things in place but what I'm very

440
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:39,860
much used to and what we're going to be

441
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:42,139
looking to do is around awareness around

442
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:45,889
doing it through things like fishing

443
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:47,690
campaigns around advertisements and so

444
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:50,000
on mm-hmm and a big part of it as well

445
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,130
as looking at it from a positive point

446
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,890
of view making sure that we don't use it

447
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:56,600
in a punitive way as what mike has said

448
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,510
because the last thing you want to do is

449
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,639
you did something wrong it's you know

450
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,440
we're trending and we're trending in the

451
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,450
right direction and here are some of the

452
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,070
benefits of doing that but it's always

453
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,930
looking at it from from what's good

454
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:12,200
because the last thing we want to do is

455
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:15,020
is disable functionality or have you

456
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,420
know systems be less used we want people

457
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:19,430
to access the systems to be able to use

458
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:22,820
that information we just want to help

459
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:25,760
them in knowing good practices from

460
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,980
potentially risky practices we have some

461
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,620
of our awareness materials that we make

462
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,149
publicly available if you are external

463
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,399
website

464
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:35,870
because there are messages that we want

465
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,939
to keep internal where there are things

466
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,830
that are are useful and there's a

467
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,289
there's a lot of people that go to the

468
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:43,939
AHS website and if we can catch a few of

469
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:45,260
them we can we can do that it's same

470
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:50,570
thing the city the city is obviously a

471
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:56,690
big part of things that we can do that

472
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:58,820
are just beyond our thank you so we

473
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:01,490
heard internet of things these days on

474
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:04,549
TV like cyber security conferences

475
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,950
everywhere so what has been the most

476
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:09,350
surprising issue related to the Internet

477
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:21,950
of Things encoder encountered inside

478
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:23,269
your organization so I think I'm gonna

479
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,399
answer that mystery two ways

480
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:29,330
okay the first way I'm gonna answer that

481
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:31,340
is it's just another threat vector it's

482
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:34,699
just another thing you have to deal with

483
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:36,799
and if you are chasing Internet of

484
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,779
Things because that's the thing that you

485
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,850
think you have to chase then you

486
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:42,679
probably don't have your PCI controls

487
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,719
and your Sox controls and you probably

488
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:45,620
don't have key controls testing you

489
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,850
probably don't have all these other

490
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:53,539
things that are a problem to be honest

491
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:56,209
though or to be fair though I think the

492
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:58,309
the work that we've already done needs

493
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,320
to be extended into that space and

494
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:03,080
that's where the trick is going to come

495
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,029
in it's not so much that we have no

496
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,620
issues with regards to those devices

497
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:09,559
whether they're medical devices or

498
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:12,100
building management systems or or what

499
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:14,539
did Tim say the vacuum cleaner with the

500
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:19,459
the camera on top I'm not sure why do

501
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:21,500
you have a it's not so much the specific

502
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,450
devices it's the fact that you have to

503
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:31,940
understand that those now are assets on

504
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:34,159
your on your and so that's the first way

505
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,809
that I take a look at it it's the things

506
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,490
that you do as part of your hygiene

507
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:39,289
program as part of your operational

508
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:41,740
excellence program those are the things

509
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:45,879
that you have to do across your

510
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:49,840
depending would irregardless of the type

511
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:54,429
of device specifically I think the thing

512
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,770
from my maybe not HS specifically but

513
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:58,149
there's been lots of issues reported in

514
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:03,700
the medical device community about

515
00:22:58,149 --> 00:23:05,799
issues and vulnerabilities being exposed

516
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,850
on some some of the medical devices in

517
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:09,639
there in the industry

518
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:13,059
and I think the thing that's been most

519
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,950
interesting about that is NIST in the

520
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:18,899
United States is coming out it has come

521
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:20,980
out with their standard on how to secure

522
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:22,178
Wireless infusion pump so infusion pump

523
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,380
is the thing that pumps the drugs into

524
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:28,539
your veins that is indicative of the

525
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,760
fact that it's obviously a pervasive

526
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:32,408
problem that needs a solution and so

527
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,820
without giving the details of what's it

528
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:36,270
in our environment I think that's the

529
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:40,740
most the most impressive thing is that

530
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:40,740
it's got that much ability that people

531
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:47,350
thank you Michael

532
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:49,870
so from my perspective the surprising

533
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:53,230
thing for for us and our team has been

534
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:56,820
an actually a lack of awareness amongst

535
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:59,830
the business folk that these devices are

536
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:03,428
technically IP devices and that they

537
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:07,210
exist so our networking teams generally

538
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:09,970
don't manage these devices and a lot of

539
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:12,070
them have been with in government for a

540
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:14,529
long time and so you have business

541
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,178
people who know that there's these

542
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:17,320
controllers in place doing various

543
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:19,149
things in the government but they

544
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,830
they're in the back of their mind it's

545
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:24,610
not an IT device to them not the same

546
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:26,710
way that their laptop yes and so we a

547
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:28,330
number of years ago we did an initial

548
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,919
scan of our environment to say okay well

549
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:32,740
what what do we have in this space what

550
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,649
would our risks here and we came up with

551
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,120
a very large number of devices and when

552
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:42,158
we would go to speak to the business

553
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:44,590
folk who they were oblivious they had no

554
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:48,669
idea that these things were actually on

555
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:50,610
the Internet yeah so your question about

556
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:52,470
what's the most surprising thing

557
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:54,928
it's been a lack of awareness amongst

558
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,820
non-technical people about how much

559
00:24:54,929 --> 00:25:02,850
connectivity there actually is and yes

560
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:04,889
your your Smart TV is they're not aware

561
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:08,459
of that so it's been a lot of raising

562
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:13,019
awareness amongst them big brother is

563
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:17,070
watching us yeah girdi similar term

564
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:19,500
micros last point what's surprising is

565
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:22,168
did degree in magnitude to which we're

566
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,419
already in it and and so we'll find out

567
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:29,669
through our close interaction with our

568
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:33,210
facilities folks be at parking meters

569
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:34,679
the vending machines SCADA systems the

570
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:37,850
building management systems new or not n

571
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:40,980
and as Robert allude to hopefully and

572
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:42,678
fortunately in some cases that there's

573
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,600
really coverage through through existing

574
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:48,059
manage device it controls and we're not

575
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,459
and where there's not then vendors new

576
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:53,428
flags flags raised first and similarly

577
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:56,789
in in the health health sciences theta

578
00:25:53,429 --> 00:26:00,840
Council and a lot of them the biomedical

579
00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:02,549
IP IP enabled devices it's it's

580
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,939
surprising how much work we really into

581
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:07,260
it and it goes on and on with four other

582
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,990
disciplines in faculties yeah and so

583
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,120
again on the one hand hopefully within

584
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:14,220
in place we're ready for device

585
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,379
management and and how are you account

586
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,419
for for risk from under managed devices

587
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,100
in stone support we can provide adequate

588
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:22,500
coverage but then there's just a lot

589
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:39,809
lotta work to do because it's it's only

590
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:42,059
growing even more magnitude we get into

591
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:44,399
some more similar challenges where some

592
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:47,370
people will say well do I have this is

593
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:50,219
this real is this a real concern and and

594
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,600
and I think to some people it's not they

595
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,019
don't think it's here yet but the

596
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:59,030
reality is we are you know with with IOT

597
00:26:55,019 --> 00:27:01,549
or industrial IOT today where Wi-Fi was

598
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:02,928
2025 years ago people didn't know if it

599
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:03,500
was just a fad if I was going to become

600
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:05,929
a reality

601
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,299
and it's it's a part of how we live

602
00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:09,830
every day this is here and it's an in

603
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:13,700
volume and it's gonna continue to

604
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:14,090
increase so so one is we need to get the

605
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,940
right

606
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:20,270
executives aware of that that reality

607
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:23,000
and what it means and in some cases you

608
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:25,010
look at these facets and you go well are

609
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,110
they generating information and how

610
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:29,059
valuable is that information and and

611
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:31,969
there may be cases where it is but in

612
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:34,460
some cases it's the function that those

613
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:37,159
devices perform whether it's industrial

614
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:42,350
control systems or in health and safety

615
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:44,299
and and so on so the reality is it's

616
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:46,580
it's a new kind of asset but it's not

617
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:49,370
that different and the approach that we

618
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:51,559
take in in treating that asset is not

619
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:53,600
new we already know what to do how to

620
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:56,450
deal with it we're a key controls are

621
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,799
how to protect ourselves and we need to

622
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:00,100
look at these systems based on the

623
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:02,690
materiality apply our key controls

624
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:05,120
understand our risk and we're never

625
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:07,549
gonna get to zero risk making 400

626
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:14,418
decisions but as these systems become

627
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:15,740
more and more risk so here are likes

628
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:19,039
people who are from different

629
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:21,470
organizations so they might be wanna

630
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,890
know about managed services security

631
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:29,500
provider so some of organizations like

632
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:31,880
including I think utilize services of

633
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:35,809
managed service security provider while

634
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:38,390
others are considering it here are there

635
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:42,500
any highlights comments or horror

636
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:47,809
stories no offense you can share related

637
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:52,760
to MSS peas there will be no horror

638
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:56,149
stories if there's something I could say

639
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,980
that that to be mindful of or to think

640
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,440
about before you go to a managed service

641
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,150
provider something that we've been

642
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,220
trying to come to grips with after the

643
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:07,070
fact when when you go to a service

644
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,720
provider and you set up your contracts

645
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:11,178
they'll be you know expected

646
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,809
deliverables of course what you expect

647
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:14,330
from them when you

648
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:16,129
when you inspect expect it and often

649
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,960
like what we've done it's it's

650
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:19,658
essentially a black box service right

651
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,899
you're it's you're paying for a service

652
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:26,090
from them so that's that's well and good

653
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:27,768
from our perspective when I'm when I'm

654
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,749
thinking about well do I have to have

655
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:31,460
staff and I don't have to manage those

656
00:29:29,749 --> 00:29:33,229
staff I don't have to manage the budget

657
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,999
for the software I don't have to do the

658
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:37,999
patching alright all of that goes off

659
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:40,609
the table but what what often gets

660
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:42,859
forgotten is that if you do that and

661
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:46,009
your organization is planning on

662
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:47,989
maturing in the future and and looking

663
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:51,109
into like for example I have a team that

664
00:29:47,989 --> 00:29:52,789
does threat intelligence yeah and and so

665
00:29:51,109 --> 00:29:54,889
in order to do good threat intelligence

666
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:55,549
you need a lot of data from all of your

667
00:29:54,889 --> 00:29:58,070
devices

668
00:29:55,549 --> 00:30:00,349
if you've outsourced to a managed

669
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:03,710
service provider mm-hmm as a black box

670
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:05,599
service a lot of that data is being

671
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:08,419
aggregated outside of your environment

672
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:11,059
you're just getting you know views of it

673
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:13,369
summaries of it and in order to do good

674
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:16,519
threat intelligence you need to be able

675
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:18,349
to mine a lot of that data and so the

676
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:20,239
trouble people can get into is if your

677
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:22,849
service provider is also servicing other

678
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:24,889
clients they'll have one common set of

679
00:30:22,849 --> 00:30:26,599
tools for example that yeah that they

680
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:28,309
use and they're they'll be very

681
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:30,289
reluctant to give you access through

682
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:34,190
those tools into their environments so

683
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:36,139
the one thing the the take away for for

684
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:38,479
for next time or somebody considering it

685
00:30:36,139 --> 00:30:40,039
that I would say is aside from the

686
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:41,570
services and all that think about your

687
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:43,759
future considerations where you want to

688
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:47,779
go and if you're going to lose a lot of

689
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:49,489
that that big data to mine yourself you

690
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:51,799
might want to include that in the

691
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:53,539
contract somehow or factor in you know

692
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:55,429
getting it back from the from the vendor

693
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:56,599
after it's been aggregated I mean it's

694
00:30:55,429 --> 00:30:59,059
true that it all comes from you in the

695
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:00,739
first place that's true but after you've

696
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:02,539
pushed it all out it's a lot easier to

697
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:03,950
go grab it from one source and to go

698
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:06,619
back in your own environment to find it

699
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:08,799
again in eight or ten or 3,000 different

700
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:08,799
places

701
00:31:09,249 --> 00:31:17,539
absolutely that that aspect about

702
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:20,408
integration is is huge and we're taking

703
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:22,429
a serious look so whether it's from

704
00:31:20,409 --> 00:31:24,169
management

705
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:26,360
security service provider which is a

706
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:28,490
managed service provider generally

707
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,409
speaking or a SAS service or what have

708
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:33,669
you as you said there's data out there

709
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:35,870
in disparate silos now and so our

710
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:39,799
interfacing needs our integration needs

711
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:41,689
were were not wanting to be five years

712
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:43,730
more the down the road and realized that

713
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:46,240
that that it's not and it's not

714
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:48,710
practical to have some some means of

715
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:53,360
integration and interface so we're we're

716
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:55,970
looking at at some solutions now with

717
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,740
respect to manage the service providers

718
00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:00,620
generally speaking we've always held

719
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:03,860
that three sort of general principles

720
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:06,168
you you as the customer owned data to

721
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:08,649
you the customer and the service

722
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:11,419
providers share the responsibility for

723
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:13,580
securing the data and number three years

724
00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:15,950
you the customer beard are responsible

725
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:18,530
for assuring that the service provider

726
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:21,789
has adequate the privacy and security of

727
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:24,260
the data and and so it's it's a

728
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:25,940
traditional adage how you can't

729
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:28,010
outsource your responsibilities but but

730
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:30,049
um just just wolf with their

731
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:31,970
proliferation of SAS service isn't and

732
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:34,940
we're not like that that's never been

733
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:37,669
more true yeah thank you I need so I

734
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:39,860
would manage services or managed

735
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:42,549
security services are just another way

736
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,959
in which to operate your assets and and

737
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:46,970
you have to really understand the pros

738
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,559
and the cons of of the different options

739
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:52,400
they have available to you and go with

740
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,720
what makes sense but you should do this

741
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,460
with anything but especially when you

742
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,010
start moving that some of those

743
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,900
functions out really understand what

744
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:02,658
your requirements are and make sure that

745
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:05,450
you you document those and ensure that

746
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:08,299
those are injected in in the contract

747
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:10,880
and ensure that you truly understand

748
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:13,460
that contractual agreement its terms its

749
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,450
conditions your responsibilities that if

750
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:19,610
your of your providers and ensure how

751
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:21,679
you would repatriate that asset should

752
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:23,030
you ever choose to that sometimes now

753
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,960
it's something that's that's often

754
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:29,799
thought about but finally you know

755
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:31,119
devotees point understand that you you

756
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,379
were asking someone to do something

757
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:34,509
you're assigning them that

758
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:36,969
responsibility but that accountability

759
00:33:34,509 --> 00:33:38,559
still sits with the organization it's

760
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:41,200
still your asset and it's still your

761
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:43,779
risk no matter what it's still gonna

762
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,019
come back to you so really really

763
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:48,940
understand your responsibilities of no

764
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:50,980
no but look this was so in the last

765
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,299
several years we've even source pretty

766
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:55,029
much everything that and the main reason

767
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:57,309
that we've done that is the main two

768
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:59,340
reasons I would say is one contracts

769
00:33:57,309 --> 00:34:03,549
that we had in our outsource

770
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:06,279
arrangements were old and not reflective

771
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:10,359
of the modern and IT environment so you

772
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:12,099
know we contract so that we can do that

773
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:13,869
second of all we spend a considerable

774
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:18,760
amount of time probably a decade now as

775
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:20,649
AHS to consolidate and standardize our

776
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,869
infrastructure or processes whether it's

777
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:26,589
IT or buildings or whatever across the

778
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:30,190
province and it's probably impossible

779
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:32,379
it's certainly not practical to start

780
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:34,418
outsourcing when your processes

781
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:35,799
internally aren't consistent or we have

782
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:38,348
different architecture and different

783
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:40,089
different applications across various

784
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:42,299
zones so we don't have a lot of

785
00:34:40,089 --> 00:34:46,619
experience looking at outsourcing

786
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:50,049
because we haven't done it because of

787
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:54,099
the consolidation and integration thank

788
00:34:50,049 --> 00:34:56,379
you so honey checkbox compliance is

789
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:58,900
slowly being replaced by risk based

790
00:34:56,379 --> 00:35:01,089
decision making so how have your

791
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:04,809
organization or risk management programs

792
00:35:01,089 --> 00:35:06,819
adapted to this current trend so I kind

793
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:10,030
of alluded to this a little bit earlier

794
00:35:06,819 --> 00:35:11,890
but but it's really compliance is sort

795
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:13,990
of what happens if you do risk

796
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:16,180
management yeah the right way and if

797
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:17,828
you're just chasing compliance you're

798
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,598
gonna spend a lot of effort and you may

799
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:21,640
hit some of your compliance requirements

800
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,790
potentially not all or at least not in a

801
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:27,700
very effective way so so yes it's it's

802
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:29,609
looking at you know your risks how to

803
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:32,710
manage your risks potentially

804
00:35:29,609 --> 00:35:35,049
identifying and focusing on those key

805
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:36,880
controls doing those things wrong and

806
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:38,740
it's not just the technology it's the

807
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,990
technology the process

808
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:43,330
and the people and continual

809
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:45,850
measurements and and then what you'll do

810
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:48,369
is you'll want to identify how these

811
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:50,350
controls that you have helped you meet

812
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:53,050
the different compliance requirements

813
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:55,420
and if you do that they'll be very few

814
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:57,280
things that are left over that you may

815
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,650
need to do specifically for one

816
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:07,900
compliance requirement versus another

817
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:10,530
but it becomes more the exception handy

818
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:13,900
to do we call about fifteen years ago

819
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:16,360
you said to me that checked us at

820
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:20,170
compliance it's it's a lot of noise it's

821
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:23,230
a lot of noise I do yeah you were ahead

822
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:25,210
of your time as always and and the time

823
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:28,180
was interesting because at the

824
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:30,330
University there's a few mechanisms we

825
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:33,609
we have a Enterprise Risk Management

826
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:35,619
Committee which it's a cross-section of

827
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:38,619
the key portfolio across the university

828
00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:40,360
and so in in itn and for information

829
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:44,260
security where we're looking to augment

830
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:49,780
the traditional sort of checkbox the

831
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:52,570
traditional more flat y axes and x axes

832
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:54,220
of likelihood and consequence and we

833
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:57,160
want we need to do compose on to their

834
00:36:54,220 --> 00:37:00,819
asset value we need to superimpose onto

835
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:03,220
their other data points other criteria

836
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:06,730
that will empower the senior leaders to

837
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:08,950
make the risk-based decisions and where

838
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,990
we'll be at financial recipe a

839
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:12,790
reputation of risk and we're not and

840
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:15,160
that's that's how we need to the frames

841
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:16,750
is similar to what what Tim was speaking

842
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,930
to the first thing in the morning as

843
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:20,550
well

844
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:23,529
needing to the frame frame some of the

845
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:26,350
questions in in a meaningful manner and

846
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:28,450
and because IT and security shouldn't be

847
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:30,970
making decisions in these fiscally

848
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:33,069
troubling times where some difficult

849
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:34,419
decisions need to be made so yeah so

850
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:37,390
that the timing is interesting with what

851
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,609
this question were we're evolving to to

852
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:41,529
become much more business based in our

853
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:45,009
in our security management yeah thank

854
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:47,800
you yeah so from an organizational

855
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:50,260
standpoint I found that the transition

856
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,200
the transition between going from check

857
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:55,700
boxes

858
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:57,140
- to managing risk is very I don't want

859
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,149
to say it's easier simple but from our

860
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:02,470
perspective it's well understood and

861
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:06,800
very easy and you know in a way simple

862
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:08,990
but the larger the larger challenge with

863
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,109
it is the organizational challenge which

864
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:14,060
is getting the organization to accept

865
00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:16,190
the idea that risk

866
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:20,380
instead of existing with the tech nerds

867
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:24,050
and see so it belongs to them and so

868
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:26,750
we're we're trying to evolve in our

869
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:28,670
environment with with the business

870
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:30,950
partners that we have a relationship

871
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:33,380
whereby they see themselves as owners of

872
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:36,848
the technology owners of the data and

873
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:39,079
we're advisers yeah and getting to that

874
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:40,460
getting to that stage for some

875
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:43,460
organizations can be very difficult

876
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:46,280
because there's there can be a history

877
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:48,260
in some places of you know nobody wants

878
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,270
to take on responsibility especially

879
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,470
when it comes and I can feel for them

880
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:53,839
especially when it comes to technology

881
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:55,279
for not a technology person and somebody

882
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,810
like me shows up at your door and says

883
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,760
you know we're changing things and now

884
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:00,859
you're responsible for yeah server this

885
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,660
and this application and all this stuff

886
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:04,460
and I used to make these decisions right

887
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,839
like do can we apply this patch it's

888
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,520
your decision but it's gonna cost this

889
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,828
these were decisions they didn't have to

890
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,470
make before so there's considerable

891
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:13,940
resistance and we're working through

892
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:17,089
that and it's the right thing to do but

893
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:18,920
I guess my only comment about this is

894
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:20,900
that we can't expect it to happen

895
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,089
overnight in an organization because

896
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,859
simply because of that any kind of

897
00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:26,720
change like that takes time and people

898
00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:29,598
have to start accepting their

899
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,770
responsibilities instead of us just

900
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,310
dumping on them because that's that

901
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:35,780
never works there's probably 15 or 20

902
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,770
different points I can make is this is a

903
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:39,170
really interesting question if you saw

904
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:41,540
oh I'll kind of tackle a couple points

905
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:44,780
so one is my counterpart on privacy

906
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:47,770
Linda French doing the same sort of

907
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:51,230
thing with regards to well actually

908
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:52,849
Michael this is your responsibility and

909
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:54,710
they would go oh no no that's not simple

910
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,640
actually it's always been your

911
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,590
accountability

912
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,319
possibility we just weren't very good at

913
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:02,030
communicating before and you work really

914
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,970
good at understanding that before I

915
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:07,990
think that's a well it's a it's a funny

916
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:11,180
thing to think about but I think people

917
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:13,850
the leaders have matured and our

918
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,859
programs have matured we've matured as

919
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:17,360
leaders to get to the point where we can

920
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:19,400
have those conversations we probably

921
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:22,220
couldn't had that even even ten years

922
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,630
ago just because the or we weren't in

923
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:27,950
that position and IT was in that

924
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:31,330
position or risk wasn't the other thing

925
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:33,740
that I would say this from a purely

926
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:41,060
titling point of view we went through a

927
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:43,549
reorg five years ago inside of i THS and

928
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:46,880
i changed our team name from IT security

929
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:53,570
and compliance to information risk

930
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:55,220
management and that was strategic in

931
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:57,760
that i wanted to get the focus on risk

932
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,899
but it was actually amazingly

933
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,450
transformative because the conversations

934
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:06,050
changed when you have compliance in your

935
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:10,009
title people go oh my god right when you

936
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:13,640
have and literally the toner wasn't dry

937
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:16,340
on the draft org chart when one of our

938
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:18,560
counterparts and IT on the ops side

939
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,090
picked up the phone and called me and

940
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,529
said well you guys are the risk people

941
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:23,650
how can you help so how can you help me

942
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:26,840
solve this problem and it just sort of

943
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:31,130
changed the flavor of the conversation

944
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:34,190
because we can help manage risk instead

945
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:37,850
of being about compliance the last thing

946
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:39,470
I would say is one of the things that

947
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:44,930
I've learned over the last several years

948
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:46,399
whether it's COBIT or ITIL or PIM Bach

949
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:49,640
or anything

950
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:53,180
the pedantic application of theory is

951
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:55,759
never a good thing and even today we're

952
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:58,620
continuing to mature how we look at the

953
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:02,250
kibitz and I tills and

954
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:04,259
the ISF IRM stuff to figure out what's

955
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:06,210
gonna make sense from our perspective

956
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:09,990
mm-hmm how are we going to build in our

957
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:12,540
organization the the controls the the

958
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:13,859
tools the frameworks that reporting so

959
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:18,960
that we have something that works for

960
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:21,150
AHS and if if I were in Hana shoes I

961
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,240
would do a different thing because those

962
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:26,820
frameworks wouldn't necessarily

963
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:28,049
frameworks wouldn't necessarily work at

964
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,130
the city and I think that's the

965
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:31,500
important thing what's gonna work for

966
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:33,360
your organization thank you I would just

967
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:36,210
if I could if I would just add to what

968
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:39,510
Robert said in the sense that for this

969
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:44,640
to continue to evolve we need to

970
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:46,830
continue to speak less technical that

971
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,650
that's that's really the only way to

972
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:51,569
move forward in a successful way and and

973
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:54,170
and yes we're the accountability

974
00:42:51,570 --> 00:43:04,590
ultimately rests it's always a bit of a

975
00:42:54,170 --> 00:43:07,050
you know a balance but at the end of the

976
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:09,420
day if we take it and we speak it in

977
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:12,450
business risk it starts to become an

978
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:15,000
easier conversation to have and where it

979
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:18,600
lands becomes a little more obvious yeah

980
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,370
ed went back to you I think over time

981
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,020
I've seen in my career a lot of times

982
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:23,640
that IT would say well the business

983
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,110
doesn't want to do that or the business

984
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,330
will never accept that or the business

985
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:29,010
and it's like well let them decide what

986
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:30,630
they want to take on and yeah I think

987
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:38,670
you'd be surprised at the maturity in

988
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:40,500
the level of understanding so like in we

989
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:43,200
live in Alberta so we pay for like

990
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,710
insurance like home insurance car

991
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,660
insurance no it's like cyber insurance

992
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:51,480
so how many people are here like looking

993
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:53,910
for like you know cyber insurance in for

994
00:43:51,480 --> 00:44:00,530
there are conditions can they raise

995
00:43:53,910 --> 00:44:00,529
their hands there one day - there we go

996
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,500
yes

997
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,120
so was he needed to know what I

998
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:22,980
guaranteed you before you paid for it

999
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:26,240
first my question comes to what is your

1000
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,240
perception of cyber insurance

1001
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:35,250
[Laughter]

1002
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:47,790
I can't get a word in edgewise it's a

1003
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:51,210
interesting question that timing wise as

1004
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:53,370
well so at the University were coming up

1005
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:56,910
on two years in with offer our first

1006
00:44:53,370 --> 00:45:00,690
ever cyber insurance policy and prior to

1007
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:03,270
that the antecedent influences so for

1008
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:05,400
about five years prior to that point

1009
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:08,759
where we finally signed signed and

1010
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,920
online probably been longer yet been no

1011
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:14,010
every year we'd be queried and you know

1012
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:16,710
so so previously but because it is such

1013
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:18,210
a evolving and an new sector of

1014
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:20,610
insurance there that there are some

1015
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:23,430
issues everything from an extremely high

1016
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:25,590
deductible most the data detect those

1017
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:28,200
would be a quarter of a million dollars

1018
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:29,910
and then the premiums and cells within a

1019
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:34,290
range of the world happen in order and

1020
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:37,859
and then so just again what it's such a

1021
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:39,420
new entity and trying to negotiate a low

1022
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:42,740
premium but as why the coverage as

1023
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:45,450
possible and as as high as possible

1024
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:47,430
things things just working out that

1025
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:49,830
there's also previously a lot less

1026
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:54,000
clarity around around if the coverage

1027
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:57,600
includes class-action lawsuits for

1028
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,970
example or punitive or other penalties

1029
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:03,560
from legislatively or or predatory

1030
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:06,390
basis and there's unclarity if father

1031
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,870
king ransomware for example if if if the

1032
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:10,450
coverage would would

1033
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:12,190
I could account for that and other sort

1034
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:15,100
of showstoppers at the time where that

1035
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:17,200
previously if something hits the fan and

1036
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:19,930
you call it in that the practice was

1037
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:23,140
that the insurer would parachute in

1038
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:25,240
their people they have a list of the of

1039
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:27,580
their standing incident responders and

1040
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,560
you were to stand down and step aside

1041
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:32,290
and so as you can imagine that that was

1042
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:34,840
a complete showstopper like we the time

1043
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:39,600
it would take for for a new brand new

1044
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:41,410
set of eyes to to get even somewhat

1045
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:44,200
effective know it would the environment

1046
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:45,940
will make sense and just just a step

1047
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,560
each other's toes and so and so forth so

1048
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:50,470
that that was not absolutely showstopper

1049
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:53,200
fast forward to now some of those issues

1050
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:55,770
and changes they've they've um they've

1051
00:46:53,200 --> 00:47:00,189
been remedied so so for example now

1052
00:46:55,770 --> 00:47:02,980
specifically around the instant response

1053
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:05,260
management it's it's ala carte so if you

1054
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:07,840
call it in there they'll offer you know

1055
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:09,610
that they can have have the PR but media

1056
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:12,060
experts they like they can provide to

1057
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:14,890
legal experts they can provide the

1058
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:16,690
digital forensics the forensic examiner

1059
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:19,350
and just adjust so what so it's

1060
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:22,480
essentially what you need and and then

1061
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:24,339
there's more clarity about the scope of

1062
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,070
coverage now so actually our thoughts

1063
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:35,110
are or that we but we do see value and

1064
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:37,360
and we've been to two years in so the

1065
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:38,920
question was posed to me come several

1066
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:42,660
times over a number of years as to

1067
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:45,220
whether or not my answer was always no

1068
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:46,089
and I always said what you're gonna if

1069
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:48,040
we're gonna spend that much money on

1070
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:50,980
cyber insurance give me that money and

1071
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:54,520
I'll put it into controls so a couple

1072
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:57,910
things changed one started coming out of

1073
00:47:54,520 --> 00:48:02,170
the finance budget so that was easier to

1074
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:04,240
I think like like Gordie said the that

1075
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:07,660
meant that whole model in the church and

1076
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:10,419
we got to the point where the value ads

1077
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:13,390
coming from Under

1078
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:18,010
the broker is is compelling enough the

1079
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:19,538
cost is low enough and and the the the

1080
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:22,480
deliverables are clear enough that it

1081
00:48:19,539 --> 00:48:25,829
made sense so we signed up earlier this

1082
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:30,940
year actually and and I would say that

1083
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:32,559
my initial reaction was very negative

1084
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:35,650
because I said I wanted to spend the

1085
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,420
money on the controls but in the times

1086
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:39,220
that we've had to just have even

1087
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:43,150
conversations with them that value-add

1088
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:44,410
is good and and because we do a lot of

1089
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:47,019
the things we do the forensics and we

1090
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:49,779
have these incident response teams and

1091
00:48:47,019 --> 00:48:52,029
we have a very good communications group

1092
00:48:49,779 --> 00:48:54,579
etc there's a bunch of things that we

1093
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:56,589
didn't need but we really said well what

1094
00:48:54,579 --> 00:49:00,099
about this the breach coach and what

1095
00:48:56,589 --> 00:49:04,299
about the coverage of caught covered

1096
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:05,980
covering the costs for Equifax or

1097
00:49:04,299 --> 00:49:07,960
transmuting that kind of thing and we

1098
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,920
got a we got the cost down to where it

1099
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,130
actually is valuable for the

1100
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:19,809
organization and and the value add to me

1101
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:22,480
is the leader from thank you so we've

1102
00:49:19,809 --> 00:49:25,359
taken an approach with it it's funny I

1103
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:28,119
had almost an identical reaction as

1104
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:30,038
Robert did when when the discussion of

1105
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:32,380
insurance came out and we were talking

1106
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:35,319
dollars and and they were large amounts

1107
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:37,359
of money and I was a little surprised

1108
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:38,650
and dismayed not at the amount of money

1109
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:41,230
but at the fact that management was

1110
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:43,420
prepared to consider that but I've been

1111
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:44,920
asking for other things to you know

1112
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:46,180
build better controls in our environment

1113
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,430
which we've never been on the table but

1114
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,629
yeah all the sudden insurance was in the

1115
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:51,009
news and it's a new thing and everyone

1116
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:52,779
wants to talk about it yeah okay well

1117
00:49:51,009 --> 00:49:54,369
now there's money for it so I was a

1118
00:49:52,779 --> 00:49:58,150
little put off at the beginning and had

1119
00:49:54,369 --> 00:50:00,130
a very similar reaction but what what

1120
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:03,190
what was difficult for us to wrap our

1121
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:05,410
hands and heads around was the fact that

1122
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:07,690
it's a very new industry I mean even the

1123
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:09,519
insurance folks aren't sure how to price

1124
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:13,990
yet because there's not a lot of

1125
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:16,209
precedent and history so we we were

1126
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:18,549
doing a lot of back and forth with them

1127
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:20,140
and it turns out that in fact when we

1128
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:22,150
would ask them a lot of very pointed

1129
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:23,230
questions about well how much would this

1130
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:24,910
cost if we got just

1131
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:26,410
this Alucard kind of service and can we

1132
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:28,779
break this stuff oh they didn't have any

1133
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:30,609
answers to any of that and in fact

1134
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:32,890
unfortunately within the insurance

1135
00:50:30,609 --> 00:50:34,779
provider there was very little technical

1136
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:36,129
knowledge as well yeah these are

1137
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:38,290
underwriters by nature they're not

1138
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:41,470
technology people so sucked when when

1139
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:43,779
you're - you're asking them well if I

1140
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:45,250
have this managed SIM service or

1141
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,840
something in place and we have this and

1142
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:49,270
here's our controls and our control set

1143
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:51,190
and whatnot what kind of rate does that

1144
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:54,609
get us versus not having it they can't

1145
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:57,340
have that conversation so so we step

1146
00:50:54,609 --> 00:50:59,529
back from it what we've chosen to do

1147
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:01,900
instead is invest in a few of the

1148
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:05,260
strategic services for disaster recovery

1149
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:06,880
and whatnot that we know we would need

1150
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:10,330
in the case of an emergency like that

1151
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,980
and almost insource them but it opened

1152
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:15,040
the door to a good conversation in our

1153
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:17,770
organization about okay let's talk again

1154
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,450
about what could really go wrong and if

1155
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:21,430
we don't want to pay for insurance for

1156
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:24,520
it how are we going to cover off that

1157
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:25,750
risk and that was sort of new new money

1158
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,310
coming in so it was a good conversation

1159
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:29,290
to have but unfortunately we did a lot

1160
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:30,130
of this around the mulberry bush when we

1161
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:33,490
were talking with the insurance

1162
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:37,150
companies at first because it was it's a

1163
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:39,759
very immature space yeah honey I would

1164
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:42,100
you know IIIi agree in the sense that if

1165
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,190
I was when I was asked that question a

1166
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:46,750
few years ago I wasn't really a big fan

1167
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:49,390
I'm now much more you know I look at it

1168
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:51,550
much more favorably now because because

1169
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:55,299
those those sorts of policies have

1170
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:58,180
really matured pricing has kind of come

1171
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:59,770
down and and you do have the ability to

1172
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:02,230
have some kind of card whereas in the

1173
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:04,619
past that was you know much more

1174
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:07,480
restrictive what I would say though is

1175
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:10,270
is each organization needs to look at

1176
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:13,450
where it is to make a decision look at

1177
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:16,509
you know what you have how how mature

1178
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:18,040
you are if there was to be a breach

1179
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:20,230
whether or not you would be covered

1180
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,550
because if for example there was a

1181
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:23,320
breach and then they really looked under

1182
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:24,700
the hood and said well you don't have

1183
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:28,240
some of the basics would they cover you

1184
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:30,029
or wouldn't they and and then really

1185
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,589
understand when there is an incident

1186
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:33,900
what it is they would cover and what

1187
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:36,120
things would be

1188
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:38,220
and and you just need to look at it as a

1189
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,750
return on investment and does this make

1190
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:41,549
sense but does it not but I think it's

1191
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:43,860
become something that you should

1192
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:44,430
seriously consider at this point okay

1193
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,480
thank you

1194
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:50,730
I think we are running out of time here

1195
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:55,080
yeah so I have time for one or two

1196
00:52:50,730 --> 00:53:02,070
questions max so we are open to public

1197
00:52:55,080 --> 00:53:04,319
here okay thank you it was a great panel

1198
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:07,050
discussion I'll give you a context

1199
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:09,950
before asking the question so there was

1200
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:13,740
a Asaka study done in 2016 which says

1201
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:15,930
there is dearth of by 2019 there is

1202
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:18,350
going to be dearth of cybersecurity

1203
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:21,810
professionals two million we would need

1204
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:23,279
so now this panel discussion is great

1205
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:26,580
because I'm sure it's inspiring so many

1206
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,420
students out here in your role as

1207
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,500
cecil's

1208
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,870
what are you doing with your

1209
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,490
organization respective organizations do

1210
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:35,100
you have any programs in place to

1211
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:37,169
develop the internal talent to help your

1212
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:40,470
own organization as well as to help that

1213
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:43,410
long term for a problem and if no are

1214
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:44,879
you planning any programs or do you

1215
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:46,109
think there are any challenges in

1216
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,550
building those program with

1217
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:51,630
organizations I appreciate you for an

1218
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:59,220
answer

1219
00:53:51,630 --> 00:54:01,680
we have constraints about the potential

1220
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:05,399
of partnering with some academia because

1221
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:08,129
there is this shortage and and we want

1222
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:12,330
to have some of these people kind of

1223
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:14,250
with that knowledge school and so that

1224
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:16,080
we can kind of start using leveraging

1225
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:18,930
some of those people more quickly and I

1226
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,759
think I think it starts with with many

1227
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:23,129
things but I think first and foremost we

1228
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:25,350
need to get this in our schools I think

1229
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:27,060
we need to get it in our secondary

1230
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:29,430
education because I don't think we do

1231
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:32,460
enough of it as the father of two girls

1232
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:34,319
very passionate about getting them in in

1233
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:36,330
technology at least having it be an

1234
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:38,010
option for them and we looked at things

1235
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:39,960
like stem programs and I know I got him

1236
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:41,730
in one I was very fortunate because

1237
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:44,670
there aren't many but I got him in one

1238
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:46,300
this this summer but I know that not

1239
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:48,370
many of the provinces

1240
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:50,410
in Canada have it such that every

1241
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:52,270
student needs to take computing science

1242
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:54,040
as an example so you can finish high

1243
00:54:52,270 --> 00:55:00,220
school and not have to even computing

1244
00:54:54,040 --> 00:55:06,790
science and I can't imagine when I

1245
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:09,520
graduate high school I just say that I

1246
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:14,259
think that it's not that we have to have

1247
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:17,050
more people in IT programs even though I

1248
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:18,880
will say that we had success obviously

1249
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:20,920
in the IT programs it's the skill set

1250
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:24,160
and the tool set that's important and

1251
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:26,830
and and I think we need to as leaders we

1252
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,569
need to be able to look beyond just a

1253
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:30,009
traditional program to say well is there

1254
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:32,200
an aptitude for that person that's gonna

1255
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:34,090
fit into our organization instead of

1256
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,870
just saying well I need this person

1257
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:40,590
because she's got this degree or this

1258
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:40,589
okay thank you
