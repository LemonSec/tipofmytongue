there are plenty of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> including</font>

some speakers were spoken earlier for me

22
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:24,490
all of this started back end 2009 when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

23
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:27,250
first came to know about bitcoins so I

was<font color="#E5E5E5"> working as a part-time web designer</font>

money a client<font color="#CCCCCC"> of mine who later became</font>

28
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:39,009
a good friend tried to pay me with

29
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,840
bitcoins I was actually hoping to get

30
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:45,130
actual currency that I can use in the

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:48,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">market back then about one dollar you</font>

32
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,830
could get something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40 bitcoins so</font>

33
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,320
I got offered 800 bitcoins for twenty

34
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:55,630
dollars worth of work and her twenty

35
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,699
dollars is little cheap for a website

36
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I was in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> India</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and at that time with</font>

thousand rupees and that's the best you

39
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:06,789
could get for HTML site at that time so

40
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:09,128
I started looking more into the problem

41
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,769

00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,349
surface web what is the difference

98
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,920
surface web is anything you can access

99
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:59,600
via say Google Bing and Yahoo kind of

100
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,360
search engines that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can index so it</font>

101
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,850
can be any site even<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Wikipedia Deep</font>

102
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,560
Web is a part where you need credence to

<font color="#E5E5E5">login like social</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> media sites like</font>

108
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:24,290
say government sites or your banking

109
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,760
sites and so on dark web is a part that

110
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need a special browser to access</font>

his bank called him and asked him

129
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,170
something very funny that he had

130
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,550
authorized a two-thousand-dollar

131
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:23,120
transaction over a email ecommerce site

132
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:25,700
which he never does over 20 so he

133
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,950
obviously told him no he did not and the

134
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,560
bank put a hold on it later the bank

135
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,450
told him that they came to know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

tell him that no I don't trust you

list of samples<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found they had last</font>

192
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,719

familiar-looking name it was of a friend

201
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,380
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> french phone numbers match so I</font>

202
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,380
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe give him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a call and find</font>

203
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:22,000

204
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:24,540

205
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,400
lot more spell words<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a lot of yelling</font>

206
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:30,490
once he<font color="#E5E5E5"> calmed down he hung up came over</font>

207
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">to my house to the back I was a cricket</font>

208
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,270
bat I don't know how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know</font>

209
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:38,080
cricket it's like baseball but bigger

210
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:40,029
stronger and heavier back he thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

211
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,650
had into his account because most of my

212
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:43,930
friends know I dabble in these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

213
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:46,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a lot so I explained to him what I</font>

have I showed<font color="#E5E5E5"> him my screen show him how</font>

215
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:53,500
things are and so on and he relax and he

216
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,089
decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bat separately so</font>

217
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,790
we went through all of his data and

218
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:59,740
decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's just update the</font>

219
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:02,230
listing that he has in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bank and see</font>

220
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,510
how things are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going is their claims of</font>

221
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:07,150
this is life data and the fact that they

222
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:09,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">are showing it with regular updates true</font>

223
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:12,670
or not so he updates his phone number to

224
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:16,030
a fake number immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> we check it</font>

225
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:18,579
nothing check in a few days later no the

226
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:20,800
weekend offer and nothing I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume</font>

227
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,950
fine they're just making it up it might

228
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,770
be old data they got from somewhere else

229
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:28,450
one week exactly to the date he updated

230
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:31,600
his phone number the new number was

231
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:34,959
there in the new list of samples and I

232
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,600
was a Canadian bank and yes he hates me

233
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,959
a lot and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not friends anymore</font>

00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:47,640
making typos free phishing pages for

257
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,350
banks and so on these phishing pages not

258
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,449
only capture the standard user name

259
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,620
password but they also have secret

260
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,510
quotients where you have to type the

261
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,630
coefficients in that way you will not

262
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,360
assume that this is say a fake banking

263
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,160
site you'll probably go along with it

264
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,160
except for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the URL that where people</font>

317
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,680
just like earlier somebody i think it

318
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:17,300
was our again who suggested don't go to

customs to pick up your<font color="#E5E5E5"> cocaine box</font>

320
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:27,120
here's a vendor who claims that they had

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,100
the government now it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be it may not</font>

322
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,810
be there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to actually check this</font>

323
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,050
without buying the product and that's

324
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:35,760
illegal but based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data that you</font>

325
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:38,729
can see it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a social insurance number</font>

331
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:52,740
make it look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> database</font>

332
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:56,010
another vendor claiming to have a

website<font color="#E5E5E5"> was hacked using SQL injection</font>

336
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:06,060
the records talk about plain text admin

bank will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> protected from SQL</font>

346

injection and finally credit cards<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

347
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:40,389

400
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:06,140
most common that I have seen is a fraud

401
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:08,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">sir sets up an account say on sites like</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">money say you see it available</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for sale</font>

407
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:27,380
for two hundred dollars will you buy it

408
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:31,130
at least you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be tempted to because</font>

409
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:34,400
you'd be well<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's cheap a lot of people</font>

00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:36,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">who will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually go and buy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so the</font>

411
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,230
scheme works like this the frosted has

412
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,909
set up an ebay listing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the product</font>

00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:46,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">customers say any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of us goes and</font>

415
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:48,668
buys it<font color="#CCCCCC"> from him because there's cheaper</font>

416
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:51,559
right so they got a really good deal

417
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:53,390
after the purchasing is done the money

418
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:55,428
is then transferred<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the process</font>

419
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:59,059
paypal account or bank account however

420
00:18:55,429 --> 00:19:01,789
it is set up the bad guy then goes back

421
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:03,289
to ebay and searches for any other

422
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:06,950
vendor who's selling the exact same

423
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:11,629
product then using<font color="#CCCCCC"> a stolen credit card</font>

424
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:14,750
he buys that item so again no<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font>

425
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,730
spent from his side after the item is

426
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,919
bored you can send it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to any shipping</font>

427
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:23,299
address so you send it back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the good</font>

428
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:25,690

00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:58,059
you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up now so there are many</font>

573
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,059
places<font color="#E5E5E5"> where of course IDs like these</font>

574
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:02,799
will get caught say at border crossings

575
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:04,869
if you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a bank and so on a places</font>

576
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,519
where they are validated then their

577
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:08,470
place is where they're not validated

578
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:11,799
like say if you're traveling in a

579
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:13,389
foreign country you can put it in as ID

580
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:15,369
proof anywhere to get a train ticket

581
00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:17,649
plane ticket and so on it's not going to

582
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:20,169
be checked

583
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:22,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">and say if you go ice skating and you</font>

00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,570
there let the guy keep it at ice skating

587
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:32,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">rink</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> while you take the ice skates and</font>

588
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:35,379
then you go home<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them you can't get</font>

589

711
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:27,220
that generally occurs in the exultation
