stand first thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for having me here</font>

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,420
and thanks for<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming to the talk</font>

4
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:17,820
outside of the city of calgary and also

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,020
in part<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside of the infosec community</font>

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
I really sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that way it's been</font>

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">great to open our eyes and attend a</font>

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,260
conference like this with uh with all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,000
these really incredible presentations so

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,090
today what we sort of have is a Mia

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,500
culpa from developers it's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> super</font>

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,640
technical talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> its intend to be kind of</font>

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">light-hearted but I'm going to do the</font>

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,660
riddle inversion because I got a lot of

15
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,579
slides and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time so</font>

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,160
we'll just dive right in how many

17
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,800
developers in the room today yeah

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,750
handful I mean this is intended to talk

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,769
about a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different perspectives</font>

20
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,140
and hopefully give you some insight into

21
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">a world which is certainly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

22
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,860
as the the corporate environments and

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,430
the large enterprise environments that I

24
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,899
know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you work in I run a small</font>

25
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">indie software development shop</font>

26
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,590
web-based software out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> lethbridge</font>

27
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:05,369
place south of<font color="#CCCCCC"> calgary we're still on</font>

28
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:08,819
horse and carriages butter churns remote

29
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:11,130
is what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying but you know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

30
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,499
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really frontline kind of bare</font>

31
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,869
knuckle stuff and hoping to give you

32
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:16,859
some insight into<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world so you've</font>

33
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:22,799
probably all seen this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hour does</font>

34
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:24,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">everyone seen this particular XKCD yeah</font>

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,999
so we just recognizing that when web

36
00:01:24,749 --> 00:01:29,670
security is not necessarily always the

37
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:31,318
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing as the internal systems and</font>

38
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,840
data centers & networks that you're all

39
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,130
managing so here's kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pieces of</font>

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,099
the talk you know we have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of full</font>

41
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,208
stack developers in our environment how

42
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,950
much are we really thinking about

43
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:42,840
security how much does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it factor into</font>

44
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,389
the work we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it'll be general</font>

45
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,049
generalizing a bit but but are we really

46
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:52,279
paying attention and Who am I who's

47
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,179
asking we have a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> company down in</font>

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,690

58
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,830
indie development shop that's kind of

59
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,300
what it looks like you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

60
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'd expect just a bunch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of guys</font>

work done hopefully so kind of the

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,370
context is here I<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that our firm</font>

64
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:27,209
is fairly small an average when it

65
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:29,459
relates to small business needs we're

66
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:32,130
generalists we're full stack developers

67
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:33,300
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't just have database people we</font>

00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't just have JavaScript people we</font>

69
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that luxury frankly</font>

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,200
everyone's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of working across the</font>

71
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,790
full lap stack and what I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

72
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,859
put forth years I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't believe we're</font>

73
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,390
necessarily the best of the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

74
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,459
that's okay i don't think we're special

75
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,619
is another way of putting things as

76
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,300
we've all done we've gone in and worked

77
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,980
on some other projects and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go oh my</font>

78
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,900
god what is happening here<font color="#CCCCCC"> how did this</font>

79
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,429
ever and you just shake your head and

80
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,810
walk away we've all been there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope</font>

81
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,120
people haven't had to do that with our

82
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,290
work yes I can't rule it out but we've

83
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,370
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> around for about 15 years and I</font>

84
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:06,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do have our finger on the</font>

85
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,890
pulse of small business web development

86
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,330
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of disclaimers you know</font>

87
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,859
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just can't stress it enough</font>

88
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,019
before I get into these very opinionated

89
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,730
matters I'm not trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that we're</font>

90
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,350
the same as if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if we have any</font>

91
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,940
large enterprise teams here they're well

92
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,560
resourced and have specialists in each

93
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,359
in each area I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a different</font>

94
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,769
thing really what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened is a few</font>

95
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,440
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago we really got on a mission to</font>

96
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:27,390
start to become better at security we

97
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,890
weren't good at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we're getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

98
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,078
that's why I'm at a conference like this

99
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:34,700
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though broadly speaking you know</font>

100
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:38,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">InfoSec isn't our our main domain right</font>

101
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,510
the premise I believe most<font color="#CCCCCC"> small-time</font>

102
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,150
developers especially the one or two-man

103
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,459
shops scaling up beyond that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

104
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,780
ignore security we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

105
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,850
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

106
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,200
some of the reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> why is there's a lot</font>

107
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,870
of reliance on package driven

108
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,910
development systems which incur a lot of

109
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,560
risks open source content management

110
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,060
systems all that ugly stuff it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

111
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,840
surprising that they're highly

112
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,850
vulnerable but we continue to use them

113
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> volume driven sales driven economics</font>

114
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,450
of small development shops do not

115
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,410
encourage the type of secure development

116
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,880
where you can really stop and think

117
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">about things often because you keep</font>

118
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,140
scaling up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing ever goes away</font>

119
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,579
nothing ever goes offline so you have

120
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">all these servers out there ripe for the</font>

121
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:18,390
picking as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into the later slides</font>

122
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,489
just going through some of the threats

123
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,659
of social engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the really</font>

124
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:25,650
irritating threats we have to deal with

125
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,360
and what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think are some common</font>

126
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,770
mitigation measures I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my talking</font>

127
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first person a little bit here I</font>

128
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,280
don't want to give you the impression

129
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,020
that

130
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,909
we're just doing a terrible job our team

131
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,380
does some incredible things beyond just

132
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the web development</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of realm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our team</font>

134
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,410
other enterprise systems but but

135
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,200
generally speaking I'm talking about

136
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:46,900
that realm of the work here where it's

137
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,300
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of brutal we live in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a perfect</font>

138
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,010
world where<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing bad can ever happen</font>

139
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,840
and given the chance I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

140
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,099
developers especially on the website of

141
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">things will spend any extra time</font>

142
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,360
building a new functionality and

143
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,530
capability not necessarily hardening

144
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,730
systems i've talked to developers who

145
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:05,530
didn't understand that term it's just so

146
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,120
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I go on I want to say really</font>

147
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,130
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this just me is it's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">we live in is there any thing to back</font>

149
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,930
this up so I did a quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan not super</font>

150
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,120
scientific but draw your own conclusions

151
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,500
I just went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top web industry</font>

152
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,440
blogs I could think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of and I just pinged</font>

153
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,690
a few search terms around a list apart

154
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,090
is course sort of the reference point

155
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:27,160
for for the web development<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry</font>

also database development<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript</font>

Smashing Magazine is the reference

magazine and then web designer<font color="#CCCCCC"> depot is</font>

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,800
just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really big blog with lots of</font>

162
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,820
articles I got fairly consistent results

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,580
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just looked at how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many articles</font>

00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:01,110
really meager results on terms that

would indicate any attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to security</font>

173
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,680

00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,760
go figure and you know an accessibility

178
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,320
is another big one you know that's a

179
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,520
topic that you might you might draw some

180

186
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:35,169
and discussion on on this but but there

187
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,330
is not the same level<font color="#CCCCCC"> of awareness i</font>

188
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:41,020
believe around security and where they

those

193
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,320
them is literally defining what that

194
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:53,770
means not a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of help in securing your</font>

195
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,870
systems frankly I also<font color="#CCCCCC"> just checked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

196
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,640
reddit I'd looked at the top subreddits

197
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,590
on particular topics you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can draw your</font>

198
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,940
own conclusions but you know of the

199
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,010
people that have taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time to</font>

200
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,930
strictly follow PHP as a programming

201
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:08,200
language or web design you're talking

202
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:12,550
orders of magnitude greater than the web

203
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:14,440
security subreddit so you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

204
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,150
not scientific but I think it supports

205
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,240
this hunch I have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

206
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,400
paying all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much attention so I want</font>

00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take you back to about 10 years ago</font>

208
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,400
eyes completely closed<font color="#E5E5E5"> nautically what</font>

209
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,080
we're doing first time I really got

210
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,799
hacked and thought oh this stuff matters

211
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,750
so as 2006 I was operating<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a shared</font>

212
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,670
server with a with a hosting company

213
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:36,130
called Hostgator I started building some

214
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,750
PHP based websites using a tool called

215
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:40,450
cpanel does anyone know what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

216
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,620
yeah few nods yeah you don't have root

217
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,840
access on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine like that and you're</font>

218
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,340
sharing a machine with potentially

219
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,799
hundreds of other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like you</font>

220
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,640
you're all in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that same server together</font>

221
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,890
everyone can have there's no particular

222
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,440
project quantity limit you're limited by

223
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,000
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> gigs of space you can you could</font>

left other things together because they

could have flat-out destroy my business

just overwrote the index page

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of figured okay let's never have</font>

into production staging testing etc that

00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,350
don't exactly know why some people feel

00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:05,440
so motivated to be such pains in the

just get access to the server and in the

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of representative had a</font>

00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,880
funny conversation with another

352
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,050
developer friend of mine a couple of

353
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,720
weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is why I included this</font>

354
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,670
in the presentation he was telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> me he</font>

355
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,380
runs a small side blog and he basically

356
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,390
makes about 50 bucks a day I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font>

click revenue here I don't know if

anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> here would turn down 50 bucks</font>

359
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,710
under their pillow when you wake up in

360
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">the morning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so it's not a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> huge</font>

361

business but it's it's good for<font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font>

362
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:58,180
except for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one day that that</font>

363
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,620
completely died trailed off 20 not

364
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,630
making any money<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore what happened</font>

365
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,589
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> where this used to be a technique</font>

366
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:08,830
people would use to benefit their own

367
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:10,570
businesses it's since become accepted

368
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,010
and ranked accordingly by the search

369
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,920
engines as kind of a black hat technique

370
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:17,710
so now people are using it to frame each

371
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,319
other and generate backlinks for your

372
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,150
competitors sites

373
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,350
so that they then become<font color="#E5E5E5"> penalized by</font>

374
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,510
search engines driving them out of

375
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">existence which required Google to build</font>

376
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:29,910
a disavow tool so now what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

377
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:31,530
do is a scan around for anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

378
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,689
putting backlinks to your website on

379
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:37,170
other people's servers essentially

380
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:39,090
framing you up for bad SEO claim those

381
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:41,219
and then swear no knowledge of them and

382
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,450
it's the shell game that's ongoing but

383
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,890
we see a lot of activity to try to

384
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,900
penetrate these servers and websites

385
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to do this type of small-time stuff</font>

386
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:52,050
and frankly it takes a lot of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

387
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:53,250
manage you won't be surprised<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

388
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:56,040
that there's still<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of attempts</font>

389
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,660
just get bad stuff on the server upload

390
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,939
fields or a common one I've taken a

391
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,439
screenshot here of<font color="#E5E5E5"> exif tool this isn't</font>

392
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,630
not inherently a bad thing and there's

393
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of other versions like it but</font>

394
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:08,040
manipulating image data there's so many

395
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,630
places around the web small and<font color="#E5E5E5"> large</font>

396
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,829
where you can upload files right i mean

397
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:14,670
it's half the point of what we're doing

398
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:16,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">and putting a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bad script</font>

399
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:19,490
into an image changing the headers<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

400
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mime</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> type so it's now a PHP script</font>

401
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,460
be 64 encoding that are compressing that

402
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,350
down so it's essentially one line of

403
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,520
code one little payload get that up on

404
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,920
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server what happens when you know</font>

405
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,300
the URL to that image now you can just

406
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,740
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question mark on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of it and</font>

407
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,770
feed it commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you essentially now</font>

408
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:37,380
run that server do most developers I

409
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:39,300
know are they aware of this yes do we

410
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:42,000
really stop and think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

411
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:45,839
things we could do often to make sure

412
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,160
that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen not usually frankly</font>

413
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,750
we see a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it you see a lot of</font>

414
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,600
attempts to manipulate images and get

415
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,820
them on to servers which leads to shells

416
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,220
this is an oldie but a goodie this is

417
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,350
the c99 shell which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've scraped off</font>

418
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,730
lots of different boxes this is a pretty

419
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,020
old screenshot<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys all know what a</font>

420
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:04,170
shell looks like is you work in this

421
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:05,790
industry but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is still floating</font>

422
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,810
around out there and you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

423
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,400
types of fun stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do</font>

424
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:10,530
incidentally the screenshots kind of fun

425
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">because I think maybe it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not this one</font>

426
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:15,780
it's a doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hostgator URL in</font>

427
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:17,040
there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a base64 image PHP is</font>

that's how it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> uploaded and you can</font>

get<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to the database you can do</font>

shell what you guys all know but why do

434
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,699
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are mostly bothering with</font>

435
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:34,490
these shells

436
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:36,649
it's to get it male and the other vector

437
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,600
that is a real pain is we have a hard

438
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:40,490
time controlling what our users do in

00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,180
the late 2000s we found out our server

448
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:02,300
had been compromised to send out 1.8

is they have a nice public page setup

which tells you if you get delisted if

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,880
look at their delisting note in broken

hundred and ten bucks per IP address for

they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> relist you instantly if you</font>

they're just this next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step in the chain</font>

530
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:51,500
ended up on this list once because

536
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,010
with it takes so much human effort in

537
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,459
time and I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's an</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">economic impact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to this it's it's an</font>

540
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,270
we see when people are injecting things

541
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:17,419
the funny thing is it's not usually all

542
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:19,190
that damaging or gross it's just this

543
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,440
link where it says div style that

544
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:23,240
actually renders out as display none so

545
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,560
we'll see sites that will be injected

546
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,370
with nothing but hundreds of links to

547

this be prevented or at least mitigated

557
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,940
by developers who spend a bit more time

they've had this this happened to them

00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,470
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this isn't so much a security at</font>

594
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:08,230
the technical measure we could take but

595
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:12,159
it's a bears mentioning<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think so my</font>

mention cpanel earlier plesk is sort of

the other one what<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are is these</font>

Linux and there's other stacks emerging

605
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:40,059
now there's a lot of JavaScript based

606
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:42,699
things nodejs etc but this is the the

607
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:44,950
typical one I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to find public</font>

608
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,240
statistics except for plesk they claim

00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,220
to manage more than 10 million websites

610
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,379
over 300,000 servers which incidentally

611
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,779
gives you an idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ratio</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of boxes</font>

612

613

public but i think everyone regards them

614
00:21:54,249 --> 00:21:57,460
as the market leaders so I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

615
00:21:55,629 --> 00:21:59,168
that in a minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> but basically it's a</font>

sysadmin stuff here's what plesk looks

00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:05,039
like but we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> use that</font>

619
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:09,309
look at the this<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes me laugh this is</font>

623
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,940
marketed a web designer right not

624
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,710
assisted min it's an Apple box<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,980
else it's this is marketed people who

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,970
know how to design things and hope as

online so they can put their beautiful

creations up there so cpanel this slide

is also from<font color="#E5E5E5"> their website incidentally</font>

635
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,679
happens to be true we do save money on

636
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:43,030
labor we do minimize system

637
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,290
administrator workload because we don't

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a system administrator to have a</font>

website owners yes this is who this is

641

00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:04,150
it's incredibly powerful this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font>

00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,950
the the user interface looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

includes lots of fine tweaks and scripts

and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can jump in and I'm play</font>

652
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:19,918
with it it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> includes lots of frilly</font>

653
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:22,270
stuff that's not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that</font>

654
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,429
important within<font color="#CCCCCC"> the scope of what</font>

configuration manager it's nice way to

657
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,610
do things it's beats editing a text file

658
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,629
it gives you a text file at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of</font>

659
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,100
the day and it shows you all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

660
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to focus on gives you little question</font>

661
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,530
marks for how to adjust those despite

662
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,389
the existence of this my anecdotal

663
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,040
experience is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a small</font>

664
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:43,150
percentage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even bothered</font>

665
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,470
but these servers together know that

666
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:47,410
this is their know that they can do it

667
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:49,030
or consider it simple enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use for</font>

668
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:50,200
the most part the mail server which is

669
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,740
included<font color="#CCCCCC"> on every one of these servers</font>

670
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,000
runs out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the box</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and is never touched</font>

671
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,620
I'm pleased to say that everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our</font>

672
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,679
company is at least good enough at using

673
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:02,320
this and then there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a end user level</font>

674
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:06,520
called cpanel so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is still the root</font>

675
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,990
access and this is the end user and

676
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,889
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of weird stuff here there's</font>

677
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:13,690
um let's see you can see you your latest

678
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:17,190
site statistics you can create mail

679
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:17,190
accounts you can browse files

680
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:21,720
you can destroy<font color="#CCCCCC"> your DNS record if you</font>

681
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,940
want to I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know why that's mixed in</font>

682
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,140
there at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end user level but you can</font>

683
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,970
also just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like press a button and</font>

684
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,740
install WordPress which of course is

685
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:31,830
bound to not have any vulnerabilities or

686
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:34,679
issues right one click and we're giving

687
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:39,030
end users access to this so is it

688
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:40,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful super helpful is it secure hope</font>

689
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:43,139
so and is there a really obvious

690
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:44,730
alternative well the fact of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font>

00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,559
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as driven by the economics I think</font>

692
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:48,929
there really isn't a super obvious

693
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:52,320
alternative unless you can hire / find

694
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:53,910
assisted min it's not a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

answer an<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFP and this is the these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

the conditions<font color="#E5E5E5"> which give rise to all of</font>

there which<font color="#E5E5E5"> brings me to WordPress which</font>

703
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,559
incidentally<font color="#E5E5E5"> powers according to the</font>

statistics on this site<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty five</font>

percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the websites on the internet</font>

00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:28,559

00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:20,280
they've checked their security probably

732
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:21,270
because as of<font color="#CCCCCC"> March 29 2015 every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

what you can do fun stuff this is a nice

this week reported theme vulnerabilities

771
00:27:54,220 --> 00:28:04,120
not quite so bad but it's a lot here's

get out very very quickly very quickly

776
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,640
which means you wake up to these phone

don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am it's secure you know</font>

804
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,200
what secure you're just saying that no I

806
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,039
real problem we eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromised</font>

807
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,149
and found a staging machine that wasn't

812
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:19,549

813
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:21,169
like three days right three days later

814
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,940
the phone rings and it was like kind of

815
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:24,950
an awesome win for us and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this poor guy</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean if the thing had just had been</font>

too faced and he was in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hot</font>

818
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:32,270
water for his client and it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh</font>

819
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:33,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">turley predictable it's not a lot of fun</font>

the other 1i the other one<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

821
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,908
mentioned where this fellow who prior to

822
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,400
working for us had his own side business

823
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:42,049
where he had set up all these little

824
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,880
boutique one-off<font color="#CCCCCC"> WordPress sites for</font>

825
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:46,010
like the local symphony and the dog

826
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,270
shelter and all of these pretty small

827
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:50,750
business again he woke up<font color="#E5E5E5"> that morning</font>

828
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:52,760
at hundreds five<font color="#E5E5E5"> six years worth of work</font>

829
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:54,770
they all phoned him the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning did</font>

830
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:57,950
not have backups did not have the

831
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:59,629
original installs they were spread

832
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,789
across multiple servers there was no

833
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:04,039
band-aid fix he might<font color="#E5E5E5"> still be working</font>

834
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:05,600
on it like and this was somebody later

835
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:07,010
who incidentally ended up kind of

836
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,270
burning out and falling off the map we

837
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,740
all know people who have had that burden

838
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:13,010
outside I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think situations</font>

839
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:14,179
like this help but incidentally and this

840
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:16,990
is where I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> the irony of this is</font>

841
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:19,460
I can like trash<font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress all day long</font>

842
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,780
but every complaint I have about a

843
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">system like that and I go that's so</font>

844
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,530
ridiculous why would you do that is

845
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,149
basically true of the same system i'm

846
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:28,010

00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:37,100
I rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it can't get away from it even</font>

851
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:38,690
if I wanted to essentially we're using

852
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,090
it because we lack the skills or

853
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:42,590
resources to properly manage a server or

854
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,510
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the scale that it would be</font>

sufficient to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be secure for every one of</font>

856
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:48,140
these dozens of businesses we support

857
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:50,540
they can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> afford for each of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them to be</font>

00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:00,130
we're happy we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing great were</font>

864
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:01,149
prosperous but we can't afford to scale

865
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,340
up to the level where each of those

866
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:06,280
people is having proper attention paid

867
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:08,470
to their security so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use cpanel which</font>

868
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,000
you know I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's analogous you</font>

869
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:11,200
know all of you proper assisted mins in

870
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,090
the room could say well why would you do

871
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,919
that well the same way I would you know

872
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:16,840
have scorned for a not really a

873
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:18,790
developer who is just installing these

874
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,610
open source systems it's the exact

875
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:24,639
critique but it's where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

876
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:27,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">ourselves and then I think as well</font>

877
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,990
attitudes don't help so it's this

878
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,690
reliance on packaging type of things in

879
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:34,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">this business model where you kill sorry</font>

881
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,350
and everything's<font color="#CCCCCC"> project based and if</font>

00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,059
you're smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> early</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on you figured out</font>

how to get enough recurring revenue in

00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:44,470
there to scale your business up but

885
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:46,720
that's often a hard sell it's a hard

886
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,370
fight people you know the clients know

887

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's you can</font>

890
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,240
world one day gets more complicated you

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,010
end up supporting all these projects

892
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,679
which were previously a factor of X

895
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:05,469
that happens to a lot of small-time or

896
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,490
indie shops so you're always<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

support all things and bring new<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

898
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:10,090
on stream at the same time but again

899
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:11,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">speaking of attitudes these are all</font>

900
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:15,100
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I've heard well</font>

901
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:16,630
should we run server updates well what

902
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,219
if the server doesn't come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back up like</font>

903
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,960
there's true uncertainty around that

904
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,250
what if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if it</font>

905
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,460
will or if it won't and if it doesn't

906
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:26,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business literally a good</font>

907
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:29,350
example is that top bullet point

908
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:32,500
recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> MySQL released version actually</font>

909
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:33,969
know that recently version 5.6 which

910
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,760
broke password compatibility with

911
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:38,650
everything before version 5.4 password

912
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,140
hashing changed and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a clean</font>

913
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:43,559
break so then where do you find yourself

914
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've got a hundred projects all</font>

915
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:49,418
distributed to the wind and they're all

916
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,100
using an old type of password<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

917
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:52,330
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should probably update it</font>

918
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,010
except where are you actually going to

919
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,918
find the<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nearly a week it would</font>

920
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:58,120
take to go and fix every old password if

921
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:00,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">you press the button to run updates</font>

922
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,178
they'll all just break just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that</font>

923
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,980
in the morning is it a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monday morning</font>

924
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,850
job is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a friday afternoon job do</font>

925
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,070
you try to do it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

926
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:07,738
night where do you press the button<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

927
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,879
will break your business for a week

928
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:11,619
so what do you just don't run it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

929
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:12,969
logged<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a colleague server not that</font>

930
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:16,238
long ago it was at eight hundred days of

931
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:17,590
uptime and I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's like a</font>

932
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:23,590
good idea the key hadn't literally

933
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:27,279
hadn't had updates in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 800 days yeah kind</font>

934
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:28,899
of terrifying so if the work isn't

935
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,369
centralized and if it's distributed on

936
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:33,158
this project by project basis you find

937
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:34,570
yourself in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> situation where we're not</font>

938
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:36,039
even talking about code at this point

939
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:38,080
incidentally I mean writing secure code

940
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:39,999
is a whole other topic and I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

941
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,769
to delve<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much into it here but you</font>

942
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:44,169
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the conditions of the business</font>

943
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:48,720
are such that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very unlikely you're</font>

944
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:51,639
doing the best you can to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on top of</font>

945
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,950
updates mail is another one so the

946
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:55,478
cpanel tool was developed in 96 like

947
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,070
it's a fantastic product<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it met the</font>

948
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:59,080
need at the time but it came with an

949
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:00,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">integrated mail server it just I guess</font>

950
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,599
seem to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally apparent at that</font>

951
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:05,019
point if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> website you want to</font>

952
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:06,700
run mail on top of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I think nearly</font>

953
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:09,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">any business you might encounter from</font>

954
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,690
your plumber to your whatever who is a

955
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:12,490
smaller shop<font color="#CCCCCC"> are probably running their</font>

956
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,899
mail through their website there's

957
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:15,158
they're certainly not so they don't have

958
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:17,049
a mail server sitting in their office

959
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,079
that's just doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe a couple do</font>

960
00:34:17,049 --> 00:34:20,710
but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> on top of that a lot of those</font>

961
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:22,599
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have their own mail</font>

962
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:25,869
servers are just collecting via pop from

963
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:28,750
their web host anyway so you have this

964
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:30,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">enormous number of web hosts who are</font>

965
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:32,409
also handling mail for their clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

966
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,168
if it was a good idea at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

967
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:36,609
it's certainly not<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore for all the</font>

968
00:34:35,168 --> 00:34:39,069
reasons that were previously discussed

969
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:40,270
such as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that users are always</font>

970
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:42,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to set stupid</font>

971
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:43,929
passwords one guy again who got us on a

972
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,129
blacklist a little while ago swore up

973
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:47,079
and down to me he had a good password

974
00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:49,679
but he came in he couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get his thing</font>

975
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:53,379
working I watched him type in tree TR EE

976
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,450
was their mail password he thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

977
00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:57,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fine and it took our entire server</font>

978
00:34:55,449 --> 00:35:00,339
put it on an RB l4 for a couple of days

979
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:03,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">so mail being so tightly integrated in</font>

980
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:04,299
here the truth is even if you know how

981
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">to run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it which I think a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

developers don't and<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if you care</font>

983
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:09,250
which I think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of developers don't</font>

984
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,690
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just there and I think it's what</font>

985
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:14,970
puts a target on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your back for all of</font>

00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:17,470
these for all of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks and</font>

00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:19,149
firewalls I don't know of a single small

988
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,669
developer shop who actually runs a

989
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,349
dedicated hardware firewall or even

990
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,819
virtual firewall for the reason that in

991
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:26,130
those scenarios it's likely to be as

992
00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:27,509
expensive as the server itself and when

993
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">the client has to pay for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going</font>

994
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:30,450

<font color="#E5E5E5">probably don't understand why it'll be a</font>

996
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:33,720
benefit I'm not saying there's no

00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:35,910
servers running hopes web servers

998
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,618
running firewalls I'm saying it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

999
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:39,868
standard practice as my understanding

1000
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:42,510
it's just not<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know open</font>

1001
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:43,920
source CSF is a common one and install

1002
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,470
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the best and hope the</font>

1003
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,390
rules hold up but I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1004
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:49,890
conversation well we should firewall

1005
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,509
this well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cost another</font>

00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:54,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">300</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bucks a month does it do anything</font>

1007
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,319
well yeah it does stuff like what at the

1008
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:58,859
end of the day they decide it doesn't do

1009
00:35:55,319 --> 00:36:00,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything so i guess the premise is that</font>

1010
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:02,520
a quarter of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is running on</font>

1011
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:04,980
these cpanel type boxes running things

1012
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,170
like wordpress with tons of open ports

1013
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,970
with no firewalls with insecure scripts

1014
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:11,760
managed by people who have sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

forgotten about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them since which doesn't</font>

even<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to writing code so even among</font>

1017
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,200
the most skilled developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know where</font>

1018
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:25,980
they can leverage a good API they would

1019
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:28,439
be delighted to because it saves time it

1020
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,150
seems to it seems to all for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> degree of</font>

1021
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,680
quality a one that we love lately<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

1022
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:34,770
transactional email service called

1023
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,140
postmark it just lets you fire off

1024
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:38,430
through a simple API call mail that

1025
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,930
you're sure is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get delivered</font>

1026
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:42,180
you're sure it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to bounce</font>

1027
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:44,009
it's if it balances it's the other guy's

1028
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:49,049
fault it doesn't come off rmx or if our

1029
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:50,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">DNS and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great except for all that</font>

1030
00:36:49,049 --> 00:36:51,990
content including like password resets

1031
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,210
and all this other stuff we're shuffling

1032
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:55,919
off to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service another</font>

1033
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:58,200
great one is stripe which is essentially

1034
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,790
replaced paypal stripes a phenom

1035
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,439
actually it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> so good at replacing</font>

1036
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:03,529
PayPal PayPal bought it so it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1037
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,299
matter of time before they ruin it but

1038
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:08,339
it's it's a fantastic service you can

1039
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:10,799
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easily integrate some</font>

1040
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:12,720
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> basic online shopping cart it</font>

1041
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:14,339
builds in coupon codes it builds in

1042
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,990
recurring payments building all these

1043
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:17,609
cool things<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your clients so you can</font>

1044
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:19,319
offer them more with them spending less

1045
00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:21,359
or you can put their budget to other

1046
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:23,279
places except now all that data is

1047
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:26,308
stored on those services you get a token

1048
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,170
back that identifies there you know you

1049
00:37:26,309 --> 00:37:29,250
get a success token basically to track

1050
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:31,170
the client records and they're all on

1051

these<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party services which doesn't</font>

00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">seem to me to be that fundamentally</font>

1053
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:36,640
different practice

1054
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:40,570
installing all of these plugins as a

1055
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:43,150
first party in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first place so yeah</font>

1056
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:45,490
we're we're still trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do more with</font>

1057
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:46,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">less and rely on other people's packages</font>

1058
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:48,910
as best we can and whether we call that

1059
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,799
cpanel whether we call that<font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress or</font>

1060
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:53,649
whether we call that implementing a sexy

1061
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:57,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">API it's kind of different sides of the</font>

1062
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:59,470
same coin I think so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> running must</font>

1063
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:01,299
have been talking really fast because

1064
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:04,540
I'm through a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of slides and not that</font>

1065
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:08,110
much time which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> great my basic</font>

1066
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:09,580
conclusions and premise are whether

1067
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:10,600
you're skilled up or skilled down or

1068
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,860
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're making fun of the little</font>

1069

guy who's just installing<font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress</font>

1070
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:15,790
things or whether you think you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1071
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:20,680
pretty great team<font color="#CCCCCC"> of developers these</font>

1072
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:24,160
same patterns kind of apply plugins in

1073
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:25,660
general bring risk which is like if you

1074
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,279
look at it it's the most obvious threat

1075
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,720
vector<font color="#E5E5E5"> that gets all of these servers</font>

1076
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,430
nuke like if you guys want a server

1077
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,319
you're all super smart you could go

1078
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:34,240
pluck a server off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tree today like a</font>

piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fruit just go to a site that</font>

1082
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:44,680
in I mean it's trivial right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I already</font>

1083
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:47,319
talked about this slide a little bit so

1084
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,690
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> small business websites</font>

1085
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,250
look like unashamedly there's not

1086
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,990
usually a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way of pre-emptive</font>

1087
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,790
security what you try to do is you try

1088
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:56,439
to write good code yes you become aware

1089
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,150
of bad practices you don't do them

1090
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,210
anymore as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could become aware of</font>

1091
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:03,040
best practices generally you try to do

1092
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:04,540
them as you become aware of a port that

1093
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be closed you close it as you</font>

become aware of services that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can help</font>

1095
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,910
you like brute force protection services

1096
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:12,370
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to install those but these</font>

1097
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:14,379
are broad stroke solutions<font color="#CCCCCC"> in there it's</font>

1098
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:17,140
not it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it's using a bulldozer</font>

1099
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">not a not a scalpel right you're you're</font>

1100
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,049
just taking these broad strokes

1101
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,790
approaches and hoping for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best and</font>

1102
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:24,520
it's a lot of break fix stuff and I

1103
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:25,990
think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only saving grace really is</font>

would be defenseless which is what you

as the people we've heard in all these

1125
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,310
fascinating talks but there's a lot of

team works like go check up on and with

1130
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,330
it sounds any familiar at all further

1131
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,430
for the enterprise people in the room

1132
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:32,960
and if not be grateful you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a good</font>

1136
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:40,160
talk in some generalizations here but

1137
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:42,799
you know our company does have an

1138
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,540
absolutely amazing team who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are always</font>

1139
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,890
developing their abilities writing good

1140
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,450
code and applying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the best way</font>

1141
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:49,370
possible but you're stuck with this

1142
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:51,020
legacy right you have this<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten-year</font>

1143
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:52,819
comet tail on a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these projects</font>

1144
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:54,320
where they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just getting more</font>

1145
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:56,540
vulnerable in the last talk we know

1146
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,560
decay was a topic well the decay on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

1148
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,310
updated because the people won't spend

1149
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,660
literally a hundred dollars on it what

1150
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,670
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do with that you're wearing that</font>

1151
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:07,580
as the development house it becomes a

1152
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:09,110
huge liability in a huge risk and I'm

1153
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,730
kind of speaking very frankly about what

1154
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:12,760
my company's experiences are but as I

1155
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:16,310
said at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning we're not special</font>

1156
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:21,550
we're not unique it's just seemingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1157
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:21,549
way it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my talk</font>
