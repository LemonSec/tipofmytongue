00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,799
so I'm thanks Richard for being here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,170
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting environment that</font>

3
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:12,850
WestJet has and Richards got some really

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,309
interesting stories and when you think

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:18,130
about the airline<font color="#CCCCCC"> industry and all of</font>

6
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:20,230
the changes and all of the the moving

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,330
parts literally it's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> fascinating</font>

so thanks Richard I can we give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them a</font>

well and just really pleased even from a

18
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,440
speaker perspective you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it feels</font>

19
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,480
like I'm at a<font color="#CCCCCC"> top-notch conference so</font>

Richard silt oh and I'm from West yet if

23
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,119
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking to get in contact with me</font>

24
00:01:04,718 --> 00:01:10,359
linkedin is is probably the best place I

25
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,069
do have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter account at Daurio one</font>

26
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:14,439
day I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get good at tweeting</font>

soon and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those of you are wondering</font>

29
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:24,520
my wife<font color="#CCCCCC"> is from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Africa and she speaks</font>

30
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:27,700
gujarati and Dario is white guy in

31
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:33,880
Gujarati so whenever I've done something

32
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:35,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad that's the name that comes out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

33
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,380
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna take care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a bit of a</font>

34
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:40,990
journey today and I'll give you just a

35
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:44,109
bit of quick brief history of how I

36
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,779
ended up here I've I've have many

37
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:50,829
certifications in NIT security

38
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:54,669
information I g-sec and my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeep an and</font>

39
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:56,348
my incident handler and and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

40
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:57,819
journey I got to a point where i was

41
00:01:56,349 --> 00:02:00,399
doing pen testing against our own

42
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:02,319
network and I started realizing when I

43
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,389
was pen testing against the network that

44
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,859
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the attacks that I was</font>

45
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:08,258
successful doing resulted in

46
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:12,010
connectivity that didn't need to be

47
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:14,559
there and that got me thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

48
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:16,660
we segment our networks and are we truly

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,400
doing the best job at segmenting

50
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,200
networks and I started getting kind of

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,970
obsessed about segmentation really

52
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,970
starting to think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and it led me</font>

53
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,190
into developing a model that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I call the</font>

54
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,540
Sam<font color="#E5E5E5"> security architecture made simple</font>

55
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,990
you're only going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a piece of it</font>

56
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,030
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> infrastructure which focuses on</font>

57
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,850
the network segmentation perspective but

58
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,010
the interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the journey was</font>

59
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:41,019
true that process I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a</font>

60
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,390
simpler<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to segment the data center</font>

61
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:46,720
simpler from a firewall administrative

62
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,220
perspective and then that led<font color="#E5E5E5"> me into a</font>

63
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,720
journey of looking at software-defined

64
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,150
networking and virtualized<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

65
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">insecurity and which led me into a</font>

66
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,850
journey of looking at automation and I

67
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:00,700
went holy wow I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just figured out the end</font>

68
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,290
goal that business needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in this</font>

69
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,910
journey and what it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I can</font>

70
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,410
deliver to business rather than just

71
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:09,430
trying to be a lazy firewall

72
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:12,040
administrator and that's I love that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

73
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:15,330
was saying I fine line between laziness

74
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,859
and efficiency I live right on that line

75
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:21,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so that kind of gives you an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

76
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,330
of where I'm heading but I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

77
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,390
this presentation off with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this picture</font>

78
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:27,070
anybody know what this picture is the

79
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:31,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">channel well done yes exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

80
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:34,150
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Philip Cosette and Graham fog met</font>

81
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,180
and it was the two teams that that dug a

82
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,500
tunnel together and you know it too that

83
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,090
was back in nineteen ninety I actually

84
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,090
remember that moment that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> old I am</font>

85
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,820
but it was it was a real engineering

86
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:50,769
feat and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally intentional</font>

87
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,980
extremely well-planned that these two

88
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:57,100
teams would meet right under the ocean

89
00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:00,160
and and be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet at the exact</font>

90
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:02,200
same spot interesting little side story

91
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,609
that hole<font color="#CCCCCC"> was not the first hole if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

92
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,500
look right between their two heads

93
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,790
there's a small<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-inch hole it's</font>

94
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">called the pilot hole that was actually</font>

95
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first hole that punched through they</font>

96
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,070
punched that one through as the media

97
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:16,540
event but they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew they were</font>

98
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:18,849
there but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that statue shows two</font>

99
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,430
teams extraordinarily working together

100
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,910
and then we get development and

101
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,910
operations

102
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:30,540
the good news is they're closed they're

103
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,729
not that far away and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font>

104
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,130
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> and operations probably</font>

105
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:37,919
aren't as far away as they think they

106
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:41,729
are and and really when I look at it

107
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,770
that the thing that that doesn't quite

108
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:45,389
get them to line up is really boils down

109
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,710
to two elements and I want you to keep

110
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:48,780
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the back your mind as we go</font>

111
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,549
through the presentation and that's on

112
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:54,929
the development side do we have any

113
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:56,850
developers here<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh awesome good so you</font>

114
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,100
can tell me if I hit the mark on the

115
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,810
development side there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always this</font>

116
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,990
feeling like<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything can be solved with</font>

117
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:06,510
a line<font color="#CCCCCC"> of code right so if we've if we</font>

118
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,330
screw it up on the API no big<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal we</font>

119
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:12,210
create another version we access the new

120
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,789
version and we can slowly evolve and

121
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,859
everything's fine infrastructure doesn't

122
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:19,560
change like that infrastructures like

123
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,870
the Titanic<font color="#E5E5E5"> you throw the rudder and you</font>

124
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,530
wait and you wait and you wait and

125
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,849
eventually it starts to change so that's

126
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,770
kind of when you're looking things from

127
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:30,210
the development<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective when you're</font>

128
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:33,450
looking at things from the

129
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:36,388
infrastructure perspective there's

130
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:39,510
there's this belief<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can't apply</font>

131
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:42,060
code to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes because it's just</font>

132
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:44,580
too scary and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing that</font>

133
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,620
the developers have figured out they've

134
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,630
figured out how do I write code how do i

135
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,000
make unit tests how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I make things</font>

136
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:55,020
easily back outta below how do i recover

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,020
and that kind of thinking is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

138
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:01,830
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start aligning to on the</font>

139
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:04,830
operations side and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we if we</font>

140
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,900
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at this farther as far</font>

141
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,900
away as we can and start to align those

142
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,310
two philosophies then when we get to

143
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,530
this point the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bridge you'll</font>

144
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,510
actually touch and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't be so far</font>

145
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,340
off so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to think about that as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

146
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,780
we go through the presentation kind of

147
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,010
keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the back your mind so the</font>

148
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,570
agenda today I'm going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

149
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,860
problem what is the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

150
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to solve I'm going to talk about</font>

151
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,340
it from a network perspective and from a

152
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,260
business perspective so you get blow

153
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,239
light both of the perspectives will talk

154
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,860
about a solution I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give a</font>

155
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,440
demo to show you how we apply some of

156
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">these principles and summarize it up and</font>

157
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,139
give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys an opportunity for</font>

158
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,610
questions

159
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:39,860
that said if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to stop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me at any</font>

160
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,860
point and ask questions please do feel

161
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:46,490
free<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let's talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

162
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,080
problem so when we look at the problem

163
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,569
from the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective and that's</font>

164
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">always where I like to start what can we</font>

165
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:55,330
deliver<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business that they want so</font>

166
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,859
that I can get what I want right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

167
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:00,289
agility is really what businesses are

168
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,180
driving towards but when we talk we

169
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:05,779
throw around the word agility and we

170
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,490
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it like it's a process but or</font>

171
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:09,529
we talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like it's an end</font>

172
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">state but it's really not it's a process</font>

173
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:14,509
it's a philosophy it's it's a way of

174
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:16,669
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so you have to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

175
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:21,259
how are you going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that Pro to</font>

176
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:23,960
that agile state so for me this is how I

177
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:27,020
mapped it out agility has to start with

178
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:29,120
automation so you can't be agile if

179
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything is going to be manual so</font>

180
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,439
operations guys we need to give up the

181
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:37,489
CLI it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hurt it's going to be</font>

182
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:39,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">painful but we need to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it up so we</font>

183
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,990
need to get towards automation

184
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,359
automation is not possible unless we

185
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:47,300
have orchestration because especially in

186
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,639
operations because the the flow of steps

187
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,560
is so critically important the network

188
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,810
has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> configured before the firewall</font>

189
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,580
can have the rule and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot right</font>

190
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,009
there steps so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to have that</font>

191
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:00,740
orchestration you can't have that

192
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:02,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">orchestration without programmability so</font>

193
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,300
you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability to have all your</font>

194
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:06,589
components be programmable so you can

195
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,639
have that automation and orchestration

196
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:12,500
and in most presentations this is where

197
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,389
it stops like when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to the</font>

198
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,300
vendors this is where it stops the

199
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:19,819
problem is and operations people will

200
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:23,419
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that they'll say the world's</font>

201
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:25,699
not that simple and that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last step</font>

202
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,859
is you need to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can you</font>

203
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:30,259
make your world more simple so that you

204
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:33,260
can make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> programmable so you can have</font>

205
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:35,959
orchestration automation and eventually

206
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,849
reach agility so that's the problem from

207
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:42,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">the business perspective working its way</font>

208
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:44,720
down to our world so now let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

209
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at it from from the bottom up and</font>

210
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,430
take a look at well where does this

211
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,000
complexity come from is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> complexity</font>

212
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,890
of value

213
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,750
you and how could we solve it if there

214
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">is no value there so what I'm going to</font>

215
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,560
use is network segmentation as just an

216
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,510
example of that there are many areas

217
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,819
that you can apply this to you right so

218
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:04,010
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said i got a little obsessed with</font>

219
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,990
network segmentation and I started when

220
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,750
I what I did the first thing I did was

221
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:11,930
started asking myself the question the

222
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:14,720
network is complicated but is it

223
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,520
complicated for a good reason like is it

224
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually adding value are we actually</font>

225
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:21,290
creating a secure environment with this

226
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:24,140
complexity so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quick</font>

227
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,939
review of how we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

228
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,560
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> right because some you guys are</font>

229
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:31,490
young some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys are old like me</font>

230
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:34,010
and have lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> history but some of you</font>

231
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,960
not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much right so we actually started</font>

232
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,370
with just the data center right and we

233
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">drew some servers in there with</font>

234
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,990
mainframes and put some some information

235
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,850
systems inside there and then we got

236
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,490
some users and we called them trusted

237
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,950
users I think we've all kind of realized

238
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,470
that terms so abused and it doesn't

239
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:53,540
really exist but we'll use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font>

240
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,860
context because that's what we did so

241
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,959
then we got some users and we gave them

242
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,510
access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> those systems and life was</font>

243
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty good relatively contained and</font>

244
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:07,160
then along came the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet yes there</font>

245
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:09,890
was life before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet so and then</font>

246
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,600
he employees and contractors people who

247
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,370
recalled trusted workers they needed

248
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,500
access that internet they need to be

249
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:18,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to get that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information of course</font>

250
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,510
bad things started happening so we put

251
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,580
in a firewall because a firewall was

252
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:27,200
going to solve all the problems right

253
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:29,450
and then we once users started accessing

254
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,160
the services we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put services</font>

255
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,900
on the internet right once we realized

256
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,000
the value of that and then we allow

257
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,670
people access to the to those internal

258
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,530
services through that firewall and<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

259
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">that model didn't really work out did it</font>

260
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:43,880
I mean there's lots of issues we had a

261
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,219
lot of security<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerns so if one</font>

262
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,230
firewall wasn't enough then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer</font>

263
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:51,290
is really simple it must be to firewalls

264
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:53,180
must be our answer right so we created

265
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,800
this concept called the DMZ and we

266
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">created this hop into our internal</font>

267
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,800
network and life was all going to be

268
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:02,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">good now of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course we still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had these</font>

269
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,240
trusted users with this high

270
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:06,040
for connectivity incited the data center

271
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,100
still accessing and bringing in

272
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:12,459
vulnerabilities this model<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't work</font>

273
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:14,529
right well if two firewalls didn't work

274
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:17,560
what do you think our answer is going to

275
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:19,149
be oh yeah let's add another firewall so

276
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:24,189
we made we created this idea of a

277
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:26,769
secured internal says system and and and

278
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,329
introduced yet another firewall still

279
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,310
the same problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> occurs we have hyper</font>

280
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:32,199
connectivity between these trusted users

281
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,849
in the data center that'll leads to

282
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:37,269
account credential leakage which

283
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:39,639
eventually leads to using the you know

284
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:41,529
accounts that you valid accounts to go

285
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:44,440
log into these secured internal systems

286
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:46,300
and and again the compromise occurs and

287
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,279
you know they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> this ties in with what</font>

288
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,370
Chris was talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> today and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

289
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:54,490
you know it's it's so easy to break into

290
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:58,329
these networks and so hard for detection

291
00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:00,610
guys to detect it because we built it in

292
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:04,060
a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is going to make their job</font>

293
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:07,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">really difficult so it's easier for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

294
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:09,160
attacker and harder for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the defenders so</font>

295
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,170
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think at this point we can kind of</font>

296
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree I mean it's a sad reality but I</font>

297
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:16,360
went<font color="#CCCCCC"> gee everything I was taught about</font>

298
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:19,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">network security really it doesn't work</font>

299
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,370
right so what it is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said let's wipe</font>

300
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,730
the slate clean and let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

301
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:26,529
with a brand new data center<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if I</font>

302
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:30,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">could wipe the slate clean how would I</font>

303
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:31,449
build that data center so I would start

304
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,000
with the data center being the only

305
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:36,939
trusted place because for the most part

306
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,470
that's working for businesses from you

307
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,470
know our pen testers they don't even

308
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:44,800
didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> they they rarely get to the</font>

309
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:47,019
data center<font color="#E5E5E5"> never mind get in it they</font>

310
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,390
report<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to us at about seventy-five</font>

311
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:52,600
percent of IT people don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually know</font>

312
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:54,130
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data center is so then they</font>

313
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,069
went it's really hard to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data</font>

314
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,870
center so with the starting with the

315
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:01,839
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> center being a trusted location is</font>

316
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:04,000
a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good place to start then what</font>

317
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:08,079
we want to do is break the data center

318
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,449
up into I I don't want to say zones I

319
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,319
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say loosely coupled services so</font>

320
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:13,569
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to break them up into</font>

321
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:15,949
services and we're going to categorize

322
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:18,079
the services but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment them</font>

323
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,480
based on those categories but just have

324
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,400
them and this this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really there to</font>

325
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,740
help the detection guys to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

326
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,750
categorize traffic now every

327
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,540
segmentation model and I looked at a

328
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,240
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and and you know I looked</font>

329
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,920
at data classification I looked at

330
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,050
compliance zoning and all of that had

331
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,300
had really horrible firewall rule sets

332
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:40,189
when I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> breaking down my services</font>

333
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,530
it got much simpler but there was always

334
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:45,410
one group who just blew everything up

335
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:48,589
and that was IT because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> T does need</font>

336
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:50,990
this hyper-connectivity so what I

337
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:52,280
realized is<font color="#E5E5E5"> IT needs to come inside the</font>

338
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,080
data center it needs to have a

339
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,280
virtualized environment side of the data

340
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">center and it needs to be treated</font>

341
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,949
differently so in this model you give IT

342
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,199
unfettered access into that data center

343
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:05,300
let them get their job done but provide

344
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,420
them with a secure area that means

345
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:11,120
limited at first they jump in so they

346
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,069
have to so it's a very thin you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

347
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,210
they have a word<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that the eyes gate</font>

348
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:19,520
right so a nice gate in a very thin

349
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:22,790
access in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then once you're in there</font>

350
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:25,910
you have limited access internet no

351
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:28,010
email no removable media so you give

352
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,949
them a safe place to work if you can

353
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">squeeze it in two factor authentication</font>

354
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,040
then you know who they are right but

355
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,670
give them unfettered access into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

356
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:41,780
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> center then put a firewall on that</font>

357
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:45,829
and then take all the users and put them

358
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:48,170
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outside so now instead of trying</font>

359
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:50,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fight a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> war on two sides one on the</font>

360
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,400
internet and one on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internal users</font>

361
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:54,140
you fight a war on one side didn't work

362
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Germans won't work probably</font>

363
00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:00,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't work for us right so put all all</font>

364
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:02,060
the mod on the outside and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then let them</font>

365
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,460
access all their internet content

366
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,650
outside of your network so now you're

367
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,410
keeping all that bad traffic outside of

368
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:11,240
your network and keeping only<font color="#E5E5E5"> that which</font>

369
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:15,110
is needed for business inside your

370
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:19,070
network and the beauty of this when I

371
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:22,760
looked at this model is ice went I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

372
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:24,380
gave the business BYOD and there's

373
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,939
evolutionary steps i'm not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

374
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,010
into them but there's evolutionary step

375
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,080
so you can do to get towards is so if

376
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,370
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested let me</font>

377
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,370
you don't let me know when we can we can

378
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:36,520
have a side conversation so then when

379
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:39,550
they when the users actually decide to

380
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,199
actually do some work they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

381
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,760
come into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data center but they're</font>

382
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,920
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come in in a consistent way</font>

383
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,950
that they're coming through secured

384
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:51,130
gateway services and and that creates a

385
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:54,700
safe environment so when we look at that

386
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:57,790
model that's a whole lot easier than our

387
00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:02,380
previous model and it works the security

388
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:05,680
actually works so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to now dive</font>

389
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,030
down into I three different<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas inside</font>

390
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,469
the data center<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going to dive down</font>

391
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,600
into those areas and show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> how I</font>

392
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:13,270
build those so I use an approach called

393
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,560
service orientated segmentation which I

394
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:19,930
love the acronym SOS<font color="#CCCCCC"> are called for help</font>

395
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:23,920
so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to break your data center</font>

396
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:26,260
up into service into service we call

397
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,209
them bubbles service bubbles and create

398
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,760
a security context around those bubbles

399
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:34,030
so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would take mail gateway</font>

400
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:36,910
and wrap that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bubble you I would</font>

401
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:39,010
take something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Citrix and bind the</font>

402
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,050
netscaler and the Zen app and the

403
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:44,050
xendesktop<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything and put that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

404
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:45,430
a bubble and then when you're doing this

405
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:47,170
what you do is you create a single

406
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:49,569
firewall rule that says I have this

407
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,920
service and anyone can access the

408
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:54,970
service as long as you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on the</font>

409
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,890
proper ports<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now you do the</font>

410
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:59,560
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing for internet data services</font>

411
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:01,600
like for<font color="#E5E5E5"> API gateway and whatnot so I'm</font>

412
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">building this with these very simple</font>

413
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,990
firewall rule set now that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

414
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything can talk to me as long as you</font>

415
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:10,839
talk to me on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> port's that your</font>

416
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,180
intended to talk to me on<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I repeat</font>

417
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:17,859
the same exercise for the applications

418
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:20,110
and then for the backend services so you

419
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:23,919
just keep repeating that service or that

420
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:25,479
process then what you do is put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

421
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,089
firewall in place and put users on the

422
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">outside the firewall so yours still</font>

423
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,540
maintaining that perimeter security

424
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:33,459
around the data center but inside the

425
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,170
data center what you basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> have as a</font>

426
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,390
whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> little firewalls one in</font>

427
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:39,610
front of each service and what you've

428
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,710
done now is you've created little

429
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,189
secured services within the data center

430
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,070
they

431
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:47,560
you can now tell the business if you

432
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,689
need to connect components go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

433
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,399
connect them because you've got them

434
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,500
loosely coupled inside your data center

435
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,200
so if all of a sudden you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

436
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">ERP send emails that's fine why because</font>

437
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,890
you set up an email service with

438
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,990
security around that email service

439
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:04,060
that's appropriate for sending emails so

440
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,860
let the connectivity happen so now all

441
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:09,159
the sudden we're giving the agility to

442
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,780
business for them to be able to to put

443
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:16,390
components together and develop

444
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:18,310
solutions and then I t when the IT comes

445
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:21,190
in they come in through that that

446
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:22,990
component through the regular access

447
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,420
just like any other user would come in

448
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:28,000
they would jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to the IT admin</font>

449
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,980
area but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then use their tools</font>

450
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,800
and have that unfettered access into the

451
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:39,100
data center so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of breaking it</font>

452
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:41,860
down from a component level<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so like</font>

453
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:45,070
I told you when we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

454
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:47,169
at the network segmentation I originally

455
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,810
started looking at using big iron I was

456
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:52,360
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put a and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically like an</font>

457
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:53,980
internet provider grade firewall in the

458
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">Senate that data center</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then create</font>

459
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,630
these security bubbles around it it was

460
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:00,850
very costly and what i realize is that

461
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,710
was that was really good to do the

462
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:05,320
segmentation but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to add any</font>

463
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:08,830
other services<font color="#E5E5E5"> than to be able to route</font>

464
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:11,679
traffic to other security devices in

465
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:13,060
that model was problematic so we started

466
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at software-defined networking</font>

467
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,460
and virtual network and security and

468
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,020
that solves a whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems</font>

469
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,640
i'm not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go deep down into it</font>

470
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,910
grab me if you if you want afterwards

471
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,140
and i can i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into more detail but</font>

472
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:30,490
i will give you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of a</font>

473
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:33,610
breakdown<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it so basically if you look</font>

474
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,930
at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a firewall in this model</font>

475
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,340
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have this bubble approach have</font>

476
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:38,500
a firewall in the center<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all these</font>

477
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,300
security bubbles when we do virtualize

478
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,910
network and security what we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

479
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:47,320
we're taking a model and we're basically

480
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:51,040
in printing it on a host so a hypervisor

481
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,480
host and then because the host has the

482
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,490
virtual networking and security

483
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,370
components inside of it to be able to

484
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,950
and

485
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,750
force those policies so then I can take

486
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,480
that same model and I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just keep</font>

487
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,610
stamping it out on every host so every

488
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,000
host intrinsically knows the policies

489
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:09,979
that it needs to apply and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the the</font>

490
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">real magic of it is the overlay</font>

491
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,540
networking which really ties also those

492
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,290
hosts together and makes it look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

493
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:20,180
one solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and that's kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

494
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:22,430
32nd<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that and then you just add a</font>

495
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:24,860
perimeter firewall and and your and your

496
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:26,630
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the solution that's kind of</font>

497
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,219
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the quick two-minute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on it</font>

498
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:32,390
like I said grab me if you want more

499
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:34,670
details<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that so let's take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at</font>

500
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:37,190
applying a solution now there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

501
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:38,960
things I want to cover off before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go</font>

502
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:42,559
into the demo just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to give you some</font>

503
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,970
understanding just a little sketch I

504
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,850
made up just to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies</font>

505
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:49,250
understand where the boundaries are

506
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:53,120
between your cloud services whether it

507
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:55,490
be on Prem I as SAS pass and and where

508
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,280
your responsibility its lay and and

509
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,120
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you look at cloud services</font>

510
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,800
you're always going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be responsible</font>

511
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">for governance you're always going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

512
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsible for policies so I'm coming</font>

513
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,510
in from the top there and I'm not going

514
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,730
to go through this whole slide just the

515
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:10,129
parts that are relevant I'm so policy is

516
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:12,440
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important and the idea is you want</font>

517
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,720
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have policy engine you want to have</font>

518
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,020
something that allows you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to express the</font>

519
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,340
policies that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to apply the</font>

520
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,929
security policies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're on plan</font>

521
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be security policies they</font>

522
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:24,260
could be storage policies network

523
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,879
policies whatever policy right you

524
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,400
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to be able to express these</font>

525
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,620
policies so you want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

526
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">express them but you're going to need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

527
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:35,750
separate that policy in the control

528
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:38,270
point so because as we move into more

529
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,550
hybrid cloud solution where we're having

530
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">to distribute that security policy too</font>

531
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,700
many different types of technologies

532
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,920
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need that ability to be</font>

533
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,840
able to take the policy and translate it

534
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,960
down and have it applied as a set of

535
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,220
controls so in today's president when I

536
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,550
do the demo you're going to see i'll

537
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,410
highlight to you when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with</font>

538
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:59,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">things at the policy level and when I'm</font>

539
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:03,920
dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them down at the control</font>

540
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:06,290
level the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools that I'm going to use</font>

541
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:09,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">our all VMware tools</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're going</font>

542
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:11,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see today but I please don't</font>

543
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a vendor pitch by any means</font>

544
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,370
although the vmware guy is in the room

545
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:24,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">so i have to be a little careful about</font>

546
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:27,100
how I say that you can wave<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jan but the</font>

547
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,959
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all VMware products but the</font>

548
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're just because it's what I owned</font>

549
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,960
and what I had available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

550
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:36,129
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this this exercise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and but</font>

551
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,870
there are other tools out there like

552
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:40,330
OpenStack has this kind of stuff even

553
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:42,610
cisco has policy enforcement engines and

554
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:45,490
distribution that so so don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

555
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:47,439
that's the only two so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big tool that</font>

556
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be taking you through today</font>

557
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,680
is service<font color="#E5E5E5"> composer and service composer</font>

558
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,870
is going to be the policy enforcement

559
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">point and a couple things to understand</font>

560
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,530
about service composer is that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

561
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,689
hierarchical in nature so you'll see

562
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:00,460
that as we go through the presentation

563
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:02,740
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create different levels and</font>

564
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,290
apply policy at different levels<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

565
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:08,350
second is is that it allows me to look

566
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:11,440
at the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> center in multiple different</font>

567
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:14,050
what we call views so I'm not

568
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,640
implementing it on in this demo but it

569
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:18,010
allows me to take a look at the data

570
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,670
center from a compliance perspective and

571
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:25,180
take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the data center from a</font>

572
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:30,100
operational perspective as well any

573
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:31,750
questions before I start the demo<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

574
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:36,790
good they're all just saying shut up

575
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:42,790
Richard so we can see the devil I am

576
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:48,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do a live demo I've sacrificed</font>

577
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:48,870
the appropriate gifts for the gods

578
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:56,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so the first part of this demo that</font>

579
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:59,910
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to run is creating a</font>

580
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:03,479
software-defined Network environment for

581
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:06,120
us to be able operate in and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

582
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,400
shows you know the power of virtualized

583
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,649
network and security because if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> came</font>

584
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,930
to you and said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know hey I've got a</font>

585
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:16,260
brand new firewall administrator and I

586
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:19,260
need an environment for this guy to to

587
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:21,570
go into and and you know practice

588
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:23,550
creating rules and practice setting

589
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:25,110
setting up policy think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

590
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:27,300
incredible amount of effort that would

591
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,979
be you'd have to go pull out you know

592
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,260
the spare firewall and you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

593
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:34,110
hook up a switch and go down into the

594
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:36,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">lab and wire everything up for him and</font>

595
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:38,820
then you know give<font color="#CCCCCC"> them a console and of</font>

596
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,540
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> things wouldn't work and it would</font>

597
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:44,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">be frustrating for the guy in so imagine</font>

598
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:46,620
if you could do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so what I what I've</font>

599
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,929
got here is this is there's some

600
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:52,530
connectors by the way there's a there's

601
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:54,330
a web<font color="#CCCCCC"> frontend for all this that's</font>

602
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:55,560
really pretty and everything but I

603
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought you guys would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a</font>

604
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:01,710
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit farther under the hood so so</font>

605
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:03,900
we went down to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower layer level so</font>

606
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,970
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see here that I've got some</font>

607
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,740
connectors that and that's what's going

608
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:10,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">to call the api's to do the work and</font>

609
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,030
then underneath that you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

610
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,200
giving a name to my software-defined

611
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:16,080
data center that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

612
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">building and I broken it down to start</font>

613
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,290
off with in just two areas

614
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,330
infrastructure for infrastructure

615
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:23,490
administrator and provider for provider

616
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,960
administration just showing that i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

617
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:29,070
can have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different layers in</font>

618
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:34,680
there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to kick that off pray</font>

619
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:36,389
to the gods so now it's running through

620
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:40,050
this script and it's calling a bunch of

621
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:42,150
api's to to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work done so now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

622
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:44,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> switch over so that was the</font>

623
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,750
automation and orchestration component

624
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:51,120
now I'm switching over to the policy

625
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:52,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">engine and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I now have a</font>

626
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,020
whole software-defined data center

627
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:56,910
environment in there so if I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there</font>

628
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can see I have my infrastructure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

629
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:03,600
provider administration you can see that

630
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have some base set of policies in</font>

631
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,928
there

632
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,168
that allow the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the administration to</font>

633
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:13,500
occur so I've now created an environment

634
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:15,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">and did that literally within seconds so</font>

635
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,159
i could give this now to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that security</font>

636
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:24,029
administrator and say go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> play</font>

637
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:26,610
in there so now let's add some more

638
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:30,289
stuff to that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cloud is not a</font>

639
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:30,289
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have some tenants</font>

640
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:39,720
so here I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just I've got the same</font>

641
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,549
connectors I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to select the</font>

642
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:48,389
provider that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put that tenant</font>

643
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:52,620
service under will call this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chris in</font>

644
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:55,559
honor of our our keynote today so he'll

645
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:57,239
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> our first tenant so and then I'm</font>

646
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:58,678
giving some environments to the tenant

647
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,850
so I'm saying I'm going to give you a

648
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:01,559
prep area i'm going to give you an

649
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:07,439
administration area i'm going to give

650
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:09,299
you production staging and then within

651
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,340
each of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas i'm going to give</font>

652
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:12,450
them or within each of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

653
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,610
environments<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to give them some</font>

654
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:16,889
areas so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow them to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

655
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:19,830
a gateway services application services

656
00:27:16,889 --> 00:27:22,459
and back-end just like I showed you so

657
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,460
we'll submit that

658
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,170
so you can see it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through and</font>

659
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,939
creating the environments and the

660
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:44,420
appropriate areas on the environments

661
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:46,640
and now it's completed so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

662
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:52,580
a service composer which is our policy

663
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:57,380
engine now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go inside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that provider</font>

664
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:59,540
area we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see that we now have</font>

665
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,929
a tenant called Chris under that

666
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:06,170
provider area Chris now has a broad

667
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:08,240
environment and he has gateway services

668
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:16,160
application services appropriate

669
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:18,110
policies are put on there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the</font>

670
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,990
last step i'm going to show you well

671
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:23,449
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> allows that but first the last</font>

672
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:25,610
last building step is let's add<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

673
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:27,350
service within there and this is really

674
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:29,570
where it comes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that simplicity</font>

675
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:31,159
if you thought about<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you think about</font>

676
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,659
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of us are maintaining our</font>

677
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,630
firewalls today you know we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

678
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:38,270
source it's it's you know this IP to

679
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:40,880
this IP on this port and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> incredible</font>

680
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:43,160
amount of complexity that it takes to

681
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,300
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to inject that rule into</font>

682
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,429
the real set because you're making

683
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:49,780
decisions like does this ride on this

684
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:52,520
common rule do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a new rule</font>

685
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,780
what is the ordering you know is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

686
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,000
going to affect the ordering am I

687
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:58,100
shadowing a rule that kind of those kind

688
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,790
of things come into play when we do that

689
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:04,280
really overly granule firewall rules

690
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:06,379
once we simplify things and break this

691
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,450
down into services all sudden we can

692
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:10,250
inject a rule into this real set very

693
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:14,660
easily and I'll demonstrate that right

694
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:20,530
now so i got<font color="#E5E5E5"> those connectors i'm going</font>

695
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:20,530
to put this into my provider and

696
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:34,200
yeah I think that's right well that's

697
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:34,199
not populating for some reason

698
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,270
oh there sorry I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just didn't pick the</font>

699
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:45,980
right time so I've got my Chris tenant

700
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:53,418
and it's in a production environment

701
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:55,970
will create a gateway service so we'll

702
00:29:53,419 --> 00:30:01,010
call the service email and it'll be

703
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:07,010
emails provided on port 25 so that's

704
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:10,780
going to kick off some API calls I want

705
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:10,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get back to hear I'll do a refresh</font>

706
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:15,979
and now we can see when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go into the</font>

707
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:19,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gateway services I now have an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email</font>

708
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:21,710
service and when I look at that boom

709
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:25,250
it's got the email policy already

710
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:28,250
applied to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so you see by simplifying</font>

711
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:31,100
how we do the segmentation we now<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

712
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:38,419
the ability to be able to do do things

713
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:40,280
programmatically so the last any any

714
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:44,900
questions before I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh actually no</font>

715
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:48,200
sorry there was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> last thing I wanna</font>

716
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:51,980
trade hey so I did all of that at the

717
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,960
policy level everyone's cool on that so

718
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:56,660
I told you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to separate that</font>

719
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,640
policy and the control level<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now</font>

720
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,679
because this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all VMware this all</font>

721
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,130
happens with<font color="#E5E5E5"> site inside an appliance</font>

722
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:06,919
called nsx manager but we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

723
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:09,440
integrating palo alto into this equation

724
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:11,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">as well so and there's nothing that</font>

725
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,770
stops us from pulling all this

726
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:14,480
information that's that we now have

727
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:17,720
stored in this policy engine out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

728
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,980
using that to call<font color="#E5E5E5"> palo alto</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> api's</font>

729
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things work out</font>

730
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:26,059
calling Palo Alto<font color="#E5E5E5"> is AP is to be able to</font>

731
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:27,290
again program<font color="#E5E5E5"> that policy into another</font>

732
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:29,510
different firewall there would be

733
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:33,020
nothing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stops you from calling</font>

734
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:34,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">Amazon's api's and whoever's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AP as you</font>

735
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,590
want once you have that policy to find

736
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,010
and it's reasonably simple you can you

737
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:43,220
can express that policy in other places

738
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:46,429
so this now you're actually looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

739
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:48,620
the firewall rule set so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

740
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:50,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">actual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> firewall rule set that would get</font>

741
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:53,189
pushed down to the individual

742
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:56,520
hosts within the virtualized environment

743
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:59,910
and this would be applying that policy

744
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:01,559
so these are the three policies that

745
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:02,970
we've we've applied in this

746
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:08,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">demonstration the rest is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

747
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:10,670
that's there from my lab so cool any

748
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,670
questions

749
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:27,020
yeah that's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good one and</font>

750
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:29,570
because we have a this<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brilliant</font>

751
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:31,490
enterprise architect and what was what

752
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:33,590
was really cool was he came to my desk

753
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:35,120
one time and he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that exact same</font>

754
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:37,250
question so how did you figure that out

755
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,610
and I said to<font color="#E5E5E5"> him I go why are you</font>

756
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:42,740
interested was the first thing like

757
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're the enterprise architect and he</font>

758
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:48,710
goes I looked over your bubble diagram

759
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:50,840
and he goes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not perfect but that's</font>

760
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:54,110
the best representation of services that

761
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:57,350
we have in our company and and I went

762
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:59,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">ooh I must be on to something and so he</font>

763
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:03,290
asked me he was how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell and I</font>

764
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:05,450
went you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of hard the best</font>

765
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:08,180
explanation for him is I I told them I

766
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,830
said I let the network tell me because

767
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:12,320
when I take a look at things from a

768
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:14,840
network perspective what I tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font>

769
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:18,379
for is if I have a group of servers and

770
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:21,770
I send a single request in and it

771
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:24,440
bounces around with a bunt and hits a

772
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:26,900
bunch of servers and then has a little

773
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,210
transaction come out that's usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

774
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:31,820
I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service so a good example of</font>

775
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:34,640
that is our check-in service it was like

776
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:37,159
it was so concise it was obvious when we

777
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,390
when we took it we group the servers

778
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,160
then we looked at the network traffic

779
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:42,830
and it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious there was like an</font>

780
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:46,340
8443 call in it bounced around like

781
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:50,060
crazy it did one call 443 call out to

782
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:52,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sabre to to update saber</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who is the</font>

783
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:55,490
reservation<font color="#E5E5E5"> engine and then came back</font>

784
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:57,860
and then gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> one 1 packet back out to</font>

785
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:00,560
the user and that's what told us<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

786
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:03,260
that's a service so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> let the network</font>

787
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:05,899
tell us what the services and and like I

788
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:10,629
said that the creepy part was that the

789
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:10,629
enterprise architect went you're right

790
00:34:13,799 --> 00:34:18,690
yeah now you get into this argument and

791
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:25,899
it's it's an interesting one because

792
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:28,720
people will go on is it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in you</font>

793
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:32,288
get into these discussions about is it

794
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:35,109
perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and it's not perfect but</font>

795
00:34:32,289 --> 00:34:36,909
the problem is you know I say humans

796
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:40,598
were great at identifying risk we just

797
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:44,019
suck at evaluating it and and we tend to

798
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:46,929
accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that that today are very</font>

799
00:34:44,018 --> 00:34:50,469
insecure and very risky<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because</font>

800
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:52,149
we've lived with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them for so long so you</font>

801
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:53,980
know I I had one person come and say

802
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:57,460
well aren't you over generalizing the

803
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:59,440
risk and I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I said we have 2500</font>

804
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:01,420
servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> our environment of which thirty</font>

805
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,940
percent are behind firewalls so that

806
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:06,460
gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you 1700 servers we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3000</font>

807
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:08,950
desktops those 3,000 desktops have

808
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:12,130
unfettered access to those seven 1700

809
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:14,649
servers I go let's make a random guess

810
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:17,289
that there's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten ports per entity</font>

811
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:20,109
that are open I said go<font color="#CCCCCC"> home and do the</font>

812
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:22,569
math on<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4700 end points with 10</font>

813
00:35:20,109 --> 00:35:24,880
different ports open and give me back

814
00:35:22,569 --> 00:35:27,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">the combinations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and permutations of</font>

815
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,410
connectivity and she looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at me and</font>

816
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:33,190
she goes I'm going to have to put my

817
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:35,319
calculator in scientific mode I read

818
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:36,940
you're absolutely right but when we look

819
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:39,160
at this from a service perspective what

820
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,589
we do is we say if we break these are

821
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,868
data center<font color="#CCCCCC"> up into services we're not</font>

822
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:45,099
finished<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exercise but the number</font>

823
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:47,799
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of sticking around is</font>

824
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:49,599
about a hundred services on<font color="#CCCCCC"> average the</font>

825
00:35:47,799 --> 00:35:52,240
services have about two to three ports

826
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:55,450
open so when I said then I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> to her</font>

827
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,669
go home take a hundred services to<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

828
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:59,519
reports / now figure out what the

829
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:02,400
combinations<font color="#CCCCCC"> and permutations are and</font>

830
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:05,470
she goes it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a lot smaller</font>

831
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's exactly it so we need to be</font>

832
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:10,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">care you need to be careful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when you do</font>

833
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:14,650
this not to scare yourself out of making

834
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:16,930
significant progress so there there is

835
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:19,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">that element of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's a very</font>

836
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:22,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">long-winded answer but there are times</font>

837
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:25,390
when risk does take precedence and

838
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,950
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> compliance is where it really</font>

839
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:28,540
nabbed us so

840
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,279
do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this concept I don't teach it in</font>

841
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:32,920
this but we have this concept of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sub</font>

842
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,900
bubble and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to take it</font>

843
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">offline later I can I can tell you more</font>

844
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:39,160
about a sub level it's a way to further

845
00:36:37,420 --> 00:37:14,560
breakdown the bubble but maintain the

846
00:36:39,160 --> 00:37:16,690
service aspect of it note we just say

847
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:21,490
that that's a security bubble and we

848
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:23,740
accept<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because if you if you you</font>

849
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:27,160
don't want to try and drive too far into

850
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:28,720
that bubble<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want it the</font>

851
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,980
easiest way I have to explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font>

852
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,430
people when I don't have a lot of time

853
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:35,619
is I say that the DMZ works but we've

854
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:37,270
overused the DMZ we put so many services

855
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:39,490
in there there's no lateral shift within

856
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:40,810
DM Z's that creates problems I go

857
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what you're doing is you're</font>

858
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:45,910
taking your data<font color="#E5E5E5"> center and you're</font>

859
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:47,290
giving every service its own DMZ so in

860
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,609
some respects you don't want to worry

861
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:50,470
too<font color="#CCCCCC"> much about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it you want to put the</font>

862
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:52,509
security around that and your detection

863
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:56,740
mechanism around it and let<font color="#E5E5E5"> that entity</font>

864
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:59,200
exists now that said what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do</font>

865
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,490
is after you've done it all then what

866
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,609
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is go through bubble to</font>

867
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:06,009
bubble and say is what I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in place</font>

868
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:07,930
sufficient for that service and if it

869
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:10,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't then you want to drive down to</font>

870
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:13,290
either sub bubble<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks you want to</font>

871
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:15,940
either drive down to sub bubble or or

872
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:18,040
put other protection mechanisms in place

873
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:20,560
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one thing I always give us a</font>

874
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:22,060
caution is you know as security

875
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,650
practitioners we try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

876
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,200
firewall be the hammer that hits

877
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:28,329
everything and it doesn't have to be

878
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,310
we've got other methods and if you've

879
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:32,170
got a good segmentation strategy to come

880
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:35,740
from then you can easily layer on these

881
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:37,870
other these other technologies did that

882
00:38:35,740 --> 00:39:05,770
answer your question

883
00:38:37,870 --> 00:39:07,540
oh yes ah yes how I always you separate

884
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:11,290
it out into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a separate bubble and how I</font>

885
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:13,300
always how I explain this to architects

886
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:15,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this is I go think</font>

887
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,890
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like gravitational forces so</font>

888
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:20,680
tightly coupled components suck things

889
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:23,290
into a bubble reusable components pull

890
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,839
them back out so that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> philosophy</font>

891
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:27,370
that I use so if you see a reusable

892
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,230
component that many things are using

893
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:30,910
that's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> something you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

894
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">pull out of that bubble but if it's a</font>

895
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,990
tightly couple even if it's tightly

896
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:36,430
coupled you still want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull it out</font>

897
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:38,259
but if it's tightly coupled and not

898
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:43,830
reusable then it belongs inside that

899
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:43,830
bubble<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good good</font>

900
00:39:53,509 --> 00:40:02,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh the story I hope I didn't say no</font>

901
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:06,759
access highly limited access the

902
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:06,759
internet we do recognize patching yeah

903
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:28,459
yeah there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think they go no trust</font>

904
00:40:23,529 --> 00:40:30,619
yeah yeah yeah and there's there's

905
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:32,779
there's also elements of<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero trust in</font>

906
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:34,759
there and actually I had the opportunity

907
00:40:32,779 --> 00:40:36,709
to sit down with<font color="#E5E5E5"> John kinder</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vlog and</font>

908
00:40:34,759 --> 00:40:39,079
talk to him they<font color="#CCCCCC"> there a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Gartner or</font>

909
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:41,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">Forester actually wrote a white paper on</font>

910
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:43,130
us you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> look it up yeah there's</font>

911
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:44,689
very there's very strong similarities to

912
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:47,119
those and I think those guys are totally

913
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:48,529
right yeah yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're</font>

914
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:53,659
definitely on the right track and I

915
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:56,239
liked Google's approach although<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see</font>

916
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:59,630
it so much somewhat is an interim step

917
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:02,389
in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have this concept of</font>

918
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:04,489
elevated access dependent on devices and

919
00:41:02,389 --> 00:41:08,779
I think what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

920
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:11,989
end is every device is untrusted that's

921
00:41:08,779 --> 00:41:13,880
just too much utopia right now so I like

922
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:16,579
what they've done to analyze the

923
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,889
connectivity and say can we elevate this

924
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:21,469
person's access because they're the

925
00:41:18,889 --> 00:41:24,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">vector they're coming in from is not</font>

926
00:41:21,469 --> 00:41:27,819
threat representative so I do like both

927
00:41:24,529 --> 00:41:27,819
those models yeah

928
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:03,950
yes it's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a two-and-a-half-year</font>

929
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:08,420
journey nine months<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it was technology</font>

930
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:11,720
the rest was people and it really breaks

931
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:13,520
down into two different things one is

932
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,080
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first step is you got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font>

933
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,610
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get them to understand</font>

934
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you need to separate policy and</font>

935
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:23,330
control that's extremely important in in

936
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:26,030
the exercise the second one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

937
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:28,520
to convince them that what they're doing

938
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:31,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">today for network security isn't working</font>

939
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:34,280
and those are two very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard tasks once</font>

940
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:36,080
you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> past that then you kind of got</font>

941
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,080
to put them on the ledge and really

942
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:41,720
scare them and then talk them off and

943
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:44,180
then once you get past that they

944
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,100
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopt it quite easily and and</font>

945
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:47,930
once they especially once they see the

946
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:50,600
firewall how simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is to administer</font>

947
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:53,899
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have a list of service rules</font>

948
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:57,339
and you go oh this service has a new

949
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,340
port just add<font color="#E5E5E5"> that poured in</font>

950
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:13,390
well that will be serviced composer in

951
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:15,610
the end right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> manual</font>

952
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:17,230
syncing with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Palo Alto just because</font>

953
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:20,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">we haven't built the interface yet but</font>

954
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:22,030
once that's in place service composer

955
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:26,820
would be the place so they'll literally

956
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:26,820
just go to here to define all policy

957
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:06,640
yeah and the one of the places you

958
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:10,060
really have to talk the security people

959
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:12,370
off the off the ledge is when you say

960
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:14,140
we're going to collapse<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DMZ we're</font>

961
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:15,910
actually going to pull the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DMZ in back</font>

962
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,799
into data center and we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

963
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:21,250
create like all these separate diem

964
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:23,260
seize the beauty of that is if you look

965
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:24,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">at a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that a complexity a lot of</font>

966
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:27,490
the complexity of multiple firewalls

967
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:28,509
goes away once you do that because now

968
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:31,180
you're just saying well I have this

969
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:32,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">environment and and I need it's properly</font>

970
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:34,600
segmented and it's consistently

971
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:36,940
segmented it doesn't matter whether it's

972
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:39,670
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DMZ or an internal service so that</font>

973
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:42,010
simplifies that one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

974
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:43,480
helps in that discussion is once you

975
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:45,850
start taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security practitioners</font>

976
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,470
and saying okay let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about how</font>

977
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:50,020
you're going to implement this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon</font>

978
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:52,299
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon is not going to give you</font>

979
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,220
separate servers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DMZ with a</font>

980
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:56,590
separate physical firewall and all that

981
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:59,140
no you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create virtual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DM Z's</font>

982
00:44:56,590 --> 00:45:00,220
in their infrastructure so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

983
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,509
you're trying to do is get them to

984
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:04,149
realize you can do that same thing on

985
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:10,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">prem or off prem did that answer your</font>

986
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:11,800
question yeah good okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can show you</font>

987
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">one more thing hopefully I can squeeze</font>

988
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:21,370
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in before I get kicked off the stage</font>

989
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:23,350
here and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is uh this this one last</font>

990
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:25,029
trip that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run is actually</font>

991
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:29,020
going to clean everything up that we've

992
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:31,450
done and if there's any advice that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

993
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:34,360
give to the to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people pushing DevOps</font>

994
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:36,700
is operations gets really scared<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

995
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:38,380
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell them that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to create</font>

996
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:40,359
scripts that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build stuff</font>

997
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:41,560
because what they're worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

998
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,570
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build all the stuff and</font>

999
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:45,970
it's never going to go away why because

1000
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:48,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is their world nothing ever goes</font>

1001
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:51,069
away it lives and it's a pain in the ass

1002
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:53,140
forever right so whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you write a</font>

1003
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:55,330
script to build something always write a

1004
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:57,129
script to destroy<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and that way you</font>

1005
