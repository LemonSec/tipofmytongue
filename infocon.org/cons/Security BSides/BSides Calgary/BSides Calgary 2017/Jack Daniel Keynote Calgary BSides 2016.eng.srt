58
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,300
little bit about history and hackers and

stuff I have a day job I work<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

stuff like this a lot of what I do for

62
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,470
besides is because they support me in

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,570
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's interesting that the</font>

64
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:59,109
vulnerability management vendors have

65
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:01,690
traditionally supported b-sides the all

66
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,930
the big names in our space tend to be

67
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:07,930
engaged with b-sides and so the other

68
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,880
folks<font color="#CCCCCC"> that do what the sales teams i</font>

work with do at other companies are all

70
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:17,590
part of this community and the dude who

74
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,340
much credit but moving on<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm very happy</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">i was here last fall and I thought hey I</font>

76
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,380
kind of like Calgary I'd never been here

77
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:34,120
before it's it's got kind of a subtle

78
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,560
and sometimes not so subtle weirdness

79
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,360
but you're all just cool with it it's

80
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,690
not like Austin where everybody like

81
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,700
we're weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I know just calm down</font>

with me and for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> record I do remember</font>

246
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:14,149
well you know how these things start one

247
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,939
guy tells another guy's son and then he

248
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:19,310
tells two friends and they tell two

249
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:24,589
friends and they tell their friends and

250
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:25,910
so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so and so so that's what it</font>

251
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:28,970
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it did it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a word of</font>

252
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:30,920
mouth you know you it took off the first

253
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,930
year there were five events as a recall

254
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,229

Austin Denver and then back to Vegas

256
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:40,040
what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it take to make this happen</font>

257
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:42,380
like the event we're sitting it now it

258
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,149
takes organizers the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that like</font>

259
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,309
struggle to make this happen so we're

260
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:47,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna do it simply right when it's good</font>

261
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:49,490
some people to nod bring it it pretty

262
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple our first time out well we're</font>

00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:02,000
takes people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show up and speak it</font>

267
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:04,279
takes sponsors but it can't happen

268
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,110
without that the cost can't be as low as

269
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,180
it is without that or free for sometimes

270
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:11,540

the first company to put down any money

283
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,640
at all and we spent more than we could

284
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:52,849
justify but they saw the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it</font>

285
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,439
and nobody had heard of a star oh and i

286
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,690
think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the few years of b-sides</font>

287
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,029
before they were acquired by<font color="#CCCCCC"> sophos got</font>

288
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,770
a star<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh more publicity at least in the</font>

289
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:02,689
US<font color="#E5E5E5"> market than they had ever done with</font>

290
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:07,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything they've done so like oh these</font>

291
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:09,110

292
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,550
about the three C's of b-sides and I had

293
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,080
at a fourth C because once I realized

294
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,890
what the first three season at the

295
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:18,470
fourth one came content community and

296
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:20,330
conversation are what<font color="#E5E5E5"> b-sides are about</font>

297
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:23,510
content community and conversation

298
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:27,050
connecting people with good content and

299
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:28,630
having meaningful conversations well it

300
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:33,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">turns out if you do those three things</font>

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:36,860
it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a positive impact on career from</font>

302
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,910
people who want to join the industry the

people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just coming out of</font>

305
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,790
from school to those of us that might

337
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,850
it's a classic case of software

338
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:01,470
Stockholm Syndrome if you're not

339
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:04,079
familiar with that you start to identify

<font color="#E5E5E5">with your captors in this case it's</font>

341
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,310
pbworks because we have all these years

customer you know what software

344
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:20,870
Stockholm Syndrome is so anyway there's

345
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:23,519
a page of what besides means to me I

346
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,680
won't read them but there's just I don't

347
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,620
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're 60 or 80 things on there</font>

348
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,949
and words like local and content and

349
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:34,380
family and career and approachable and

350

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,319
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more community I had to</font>

go there a community so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

355
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:51,630
about the infosec community we like to

356
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,589
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the hacker community there's</font>

357
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:58,170
really a lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> communities I</font>

358
00:16:54,589 --> 00:17:00,269
actually like the sociologist term of

359
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,949
tribes because tribes and nations kind

360
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,839
of works better because their hacker

367
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,470
I see and one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that besides</font>

368
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,500
can help with is I see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

369
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:26,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">different splits so there's one when you</font>

370
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:31,640
meet somebody in an event what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

371
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:34,340
I'm a hacker or I work in infosec or I'm

372
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,720
an infosec professional and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

373
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,500
those of us who straddled two divided

374
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:42,320
right so I'm in China or you know

375
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:46,760
Chinese smoking jacket and top hat in my

376
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:49,370
in my foolish beard and I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fit</font>

377
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,960
there and then I kind of stand out but

378
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,699
thankfully<font color="#CCCCCC"> their folks like with diffie</font>

379
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,510
and others who make me not look quite as

380
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,919
weird on the other side and it's a

381
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,370
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> awkward when our friends start to</font>

382
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,419
battle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that happens occasionally I</font>

383
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,649
mean we could sliced up way too many

384
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:06,169
ways a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a hobby</font>

they may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in technology or may not but</font>

386
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:11,090
they love to act stuff and it's fun

387
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:12,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's cool some people just consider</font>

388
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,240
themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> professional some people</font>

389
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,250

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,370
they're red team or blue team another

391
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:21,530
division i didn't put in here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

392
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:24,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">but you're defending a major corporation</font>

393
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:25,820
or a small company and then there's you

394
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,889
know us horrible vendor pimps right

395
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,720
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then even amongst our us we</font>

396
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,760
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fight over all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do</font>

397
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,290
services you're just pushing boxes are

398
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,120
you just pushing out really come on and

399
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,620
then it is academia they don't

400
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,000
understand the real world we don't

401
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,860
understand them even though they have

402
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,750
some amazing ideas and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't and</font>

403
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,219
then there's government and military and

404
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,750
if you don't deal with them you tend to

405
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:50,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">lump those two together and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font>

406
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:53,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">really bad idea and then we stratify</font>

407
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,070
even in their trench warriors these are

408
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,520
people actually do unlike

409
00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:00,110
management

410
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,610
various strata of management executives

00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:05,629
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> Outsiders with a lot of</font>

414
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:13,610
jack it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did go there but thankfully</font>

415
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,419
there are more people with<font color="#E5E5E5"> impostor</font>

416
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:19,100
syndrome than the other but we're best

417
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:20,480
when we bridge these divides and that's

418
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:24,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes I want to talk about for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:27,890
minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what b-sides can help do so</font>

420
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:29,809
let's let's talk about hackers a little

421
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:33,309
over 30 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hacker manifesto</font>

422
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:35,889
came out and frack and two I wrote it

423
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:38,658
really resonated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of people I</font>

424
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:43,250
will say this it was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very</font>

425
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:44,659
well written I can't yeah I get what he

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,200
was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say but it wasn't very</font>

427
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:50,510
eloquent but at the end there was one of

428
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,860
the last paragraph or<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost like yes</font>

429
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,408
I'm a criminal my crime is that of

430
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:56,299
curiosity my crime is that of judging

431
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:58,549
people by what they say and think not

432
00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:00,470
what they look like my crime is that of

433
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:04,100
outsmarting you something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will</font>

434
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:07,100
never forgive me<font color="#CCCCCC"> for what parts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

435
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:10,070
except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the criminal stuff i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldnt</font>

436
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:12,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">try what people did decades ago now it</font>

437
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,178
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be bad for you especially if you</font>

438
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be somewhere where they'll</font>

439
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,970
extradite you to the US because

440
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,289
apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have no sense of humor and</font>

441
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,419
we're really frustrated that we can't

442
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:22,100
get like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Ukrainians and North</font>

443
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,659
Koreans and therefore we just slammed

444
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:27,230
people that she get a slap on the wrist

445
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:30,830
in jail for decades but<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of that you</font>

446
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:33,409
know judging people online I hate the

447
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,539
phrase duoc<font color="#CCCCCC"> recei but you know some sort</font>

448
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:38,350
of merit based thing and it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

449
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:40,669
to be brilliance it can be participation

450
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:45,590
that kind of leads into thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am a</font>

451
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:48,200
hacker not this<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind there is a ton of</font>

452
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:50,779
really crappy clipart about hackers out

453
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,870
there on the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have found what</font>

454
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:58,820
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be the most accurate stock</font>

455
00:20:53,870 --> 00:21:02,229
photo of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hacker on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet just</font>

456
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,230
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish this and ok</font>

457
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:11,830
what does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I think it's</font>

458
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,870
something I they're all sorts of

459
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:16,270
definitions I can argue<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitions but</font>

460
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:19,750
I've got some<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas one of the key ideas</font>

461
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:21,250
to me about what hacker means it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

462
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,250
criminal it's not the mainstream

463
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:26,110
definition it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's curiosity you know</font>

464
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:30,100
a childlike sense of wonder and

465
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:32,830
curiosity ooh what's that what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do</font>

466
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,100
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it don't do that with it uh-huh</font>

467
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:37,899
what happens if I do that with it right

468
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:45,668
sometimes it's childish<font color="#CCCCCC"> too but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

469
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:50,049
whole nother talk testing limits we push

470
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:51,940
push things to the edge sometimes

471
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:53,470
because it's fun to break let's be

472
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,540
honest right let's be honest sometimes

473
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,480
it's fun to break stuff but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

474
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:01,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">just breaking stuff it's how it breaks</font>

475
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,970
why it breaks what it took to do that

476
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:07,960
what the post break situation is how do

477
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:12,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">I make it stronger how to prevent or</font>

478
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:16,570
delay breaking sort of a cycle of break

479
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:18,640
fix improved repeat right and part of

480
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">that cycle in the earlier days of the</font>

481
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,679
hacker world when everybody was on BBS's

482
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:26,590
are met up at the food court at the mall

483
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:35,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">or wherever people met and def</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> con at</font>

484
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:35,250
some cons was this learn share repeat

485
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,960
these sides are an<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity there are</font>

486
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">other events too but we're to be side so</font>

487
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,520
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about visa these sides</font>

488
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:48,549
are an opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this learn</font>

489
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,929
share and repeat now my background is

490
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:51,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">automotive so this kind of reminds me of</font>

491
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:54,340
the hot-rodders because we would drive

492
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,780
we push our cars until it broke and then

493
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,379
we would fix them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and try to figure out</font>

494
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:01,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to keep that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from breaking again and</font>

495
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:03,790
then we do it again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

496
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,830
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> second or third time we'd be like</font>

497
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh time to upgrade the brakes because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

498
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:09,790
keep running<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the road now that I</font>

499
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,679
have more power but it's the same cycle

500
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:14,080
but you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom line is the</font>

501
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,669
world's a puzzle to us we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

502
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,439
understand it we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play with it we</font>

503
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:19,809
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know where we fit into it and</font>

504
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,620
we're one of the pieces we play with so

505
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:27,690
that's awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that quickly clicker</font>

506
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:31,178
happy but here's one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our challenges</font>

507
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:33,250
I'm doing this fun stuff oh oh my

508
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:38,050
goodness somebody's gonna pay me to do

509
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:40,809
this I got a job doing what I love this

510
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:42,790
is not just a job I have a career this

511
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:49,510
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome I have made a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> career out of</font>

512
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:52,330
my hobby but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means I've gotta</font>

513
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:56,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">write reports means i got TPS reports</font>

514
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:58,270
that means i gotta explain why doing

515
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:02,429
this to that machine is problematic<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

516
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,429
have to explain why this exposes us

517
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,120
there are some of the early hacker

518
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:13,990
community sees just the spot in some of

519
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:17,070
the loft crew that became at stake and

520
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:19,900
have scattered around some rivera code

521
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:22,809
it's a hobby holy crap we can make money

522
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,610
out of our hobby oh it's like a real job

523
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:28,450
oh my goodness we've made a career out

524
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:30,610
of it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that fun anymore but</font>

525
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,780
there's still a spark of fun we've grown

526
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,550
you don't we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to grow</font>

527
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:37,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">the company so we need to find people</font>

528
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:46,149
who had that spark that curiosity hire

529
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:47,230
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and drive it out of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to man but</font>

530
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,580
money is part of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I mean</font>

531
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:52,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are dropping OD at Def</font>

532
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:54,399
Con right and for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> four businesses I</font>

533
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:55,870
spend time talking to people that are

534
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to defend their environments bug</font>

535
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:03,668
bounties are cool but bounties are a

536
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:04,960
great evolution of not just not suing

537
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:07,540
people when they find<font color="#E5E5E5"> something wrong</font>

538
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your stuff but actually encouraging</font>

539
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,350
people to do it in a controlled and dare

540
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:13,480
I say responsible way although I hate

541
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:15,370
the word responsible responsible is

542
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,500
usually a word that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> used against</font>

543
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:22,800
people who find vulnerabilities

544
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:25,500
responsible disclosure and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

545

any<font color="#E5E5E5"> leet haxor when it comes to break</font>

546
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,870
and stuff but all you have to do is pay

547
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,180
attention on the web to find

548
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:33,570
vulnerabilities and I'm not saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> boat</font>

549
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:36,060
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> or anything else you just do but</font>

550
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:37,470
the money is made it different so what

551
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,080
do we do remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> what got us started</font>

552
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:42,690
that's why we're here explore learn

553
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,370
share teach do things that are rewarding

554
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,810
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things we found is hey take</font>

555
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,669
on a project remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used to love</font>

556
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,530
to play with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so everybody's playing</font>

557
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:50,730
with drones now that's cool play with

558
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:52,110
drones do cool stuff with drones

559
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,790
Raspberry Pi has been around for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

years people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing more and more you</font>

know home automation stuff you're

562
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,670
certainly not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy the garbage</font>

of garbage that was in there you know

that's where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could learn right I could</font>

go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to these user groups I could go to</font>

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,740
make it happen and I learned and then I

650
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,580
shared and I helped and it's like I

651
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,389
don't know anything about blacksmithing

652
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,489
I know what

653
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:52,189
room is I know which end I hold I'll

up welcome in the forges of some of the

00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:08,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I discovered was it was part of the</font>

659
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:10,190
path wasn't my motivation I wasn't

660
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:12,379
networking with people to make

661
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">connections to end up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a really</font>

662
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:16,099
awesome job but it happened and that

663
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:18,619
leads me to one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my favorite people to</font>

664
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:20,708
talk about if you've ever seen me speak

665
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:27,668
before I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about this dude</font>

666
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:31,129
Newton look at here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's awesome</font>

667
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:37,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">so come I'm growing it's good on top of</font>

668
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:40,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">my head now yeah Isaac Newton is</font>

669
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:42,859
famously quoted as saying if I've seen

670
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,079
further it is only by standing on the

671
00:30:42,859 --> 00:30:47,478
shoulders of giants that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

672
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:50,629
an original quote of his somebody that

673
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:52,999
he's whose shoulders he stood on told

674
00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:57,199
him that when he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> crediting one of</font>

675
00:30:52,999 --> 00:31:01,159
his mentors or educators but let's think

676
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:05,599
about it this guy changed the way we see

677
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:07,070
the world around us forever if I've done

678
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,658
anything it's because other people got a

679
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,658
head start and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just took it from there</font>

680
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:17,478
that's the kind of attitude builds a

681
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:19,279
community right and let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and</font>

682
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:21,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">be idealistic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jack one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

683
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:25,399
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will occasionally say about that</font>

684
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:28,969
is the critical thing is not being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

685
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:31,820
giant the critical<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is offering a</font>

686
00:31:28,969 --> 00:31:35,209
shoulder for others when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you offer your</font>

687
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:37,249
shoulder to others that's part of what

688
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:42,320
makes you a giant not the other way

689
00:31:37,249 --> 00:31:46,119
around so how we doing man<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going way</font>

690
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:51,499
fast good thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I can tell stories</font>

691
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:55,639
this dude also said this there<font color="#E5E5E5"> tons of</font>

692
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:59,139
quotes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a smart dude how we</font>

693
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:59,139
doing do

694
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:06,930
so I'd note about Newton so we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

695
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:09,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">process as a raised species whatever of</font>

696
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:13,470
trying to disprove Newtonian physics to

697
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:16,980
move beyond Newtonian physics right who

698
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:20,000
hopes that Newtonian physics hold at our

699
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:22,530
level more than anyone else in the world

700
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,180
the people trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to disprove it because</font>

701
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:25,950
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know about you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but I hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

702
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:28,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sheer force of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nuts-and-bolts</font>

703
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:30,570
actually works if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sitting on top of</font>

704
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:32,370
that stupid Large Hadron Collider I want

705
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:34,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">that stuff to stay in there I hope</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> U's</font>

706
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:46,820
right it can go weird under there so

707
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:46,820
anyway we have some weird hobbies Newton

708
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:51,540
besides the the borrowed one my favorite

709
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:54,240
quote of Newton's is this I do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

710
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:56,399
what I may appear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the world but to</font>

711
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,310
myself I seem to have been only like a

712
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,510
boy playing on the seashore and

713
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:03,990
diverting myself and now and then

714
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:07,500
finding in a smoother pedal pebble or a

715
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:09,720
prettier shell than ordinary whilst the

716
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:14,880
great ocean of truth lay undiscovered

717
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:16,620
before me so playing with drones if you

718
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,300
think that's cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is cool somebody</font>

719
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,949
else is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool Newton</font>

720
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,960
thought he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing with pebbles so</font>

721
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,250
you know find your pebbles that's one of

722
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,970
the things that this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of community</font>

723
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:29,220
can help you do and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrap</font>

724
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:31,110
up really early but here's a new thought

725
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,490
of head recently so if you do these

726
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:35,219
things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you become part of a</font>

727
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:36,990
community and you share what you know

728
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:40,830
you end up in front of a room full of

729
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:45,620
people maybe figuratively maybe

730
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:53,370
literally and in this case literally the

731
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:55,530
spotlight lands on you always carry a

732
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:57,750
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual mirror in your head so</font>

733
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:59,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can reflect some of that light back</font>

734
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,080
on the people that helped you get there

735
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:04,140
and some of the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are coming</font>

736
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">up behind you that could use some credit</font>

737
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,769
for things that they don't know

738
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,129
there are too many people in the

739
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:14,369
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Treadway they may</font>

740
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:16,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">not have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the personality they may not be</font>

741
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:17,820
old enough to not care what people think

742
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:20,429
and they may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be comfortable making</font>

743
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,839
an ass out of themselves so they may sit

744
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:24,060
quietly but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out there</font>

745
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,710
and that's advanced an age thing the

746
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:28,379
older I get the less I care what people

747
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:31,020
think on<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> levels and on other levels</font>

748
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:32,759
it's completely the other way around but

749
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,739
so I share that spotlight and there are

750
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,690
too many year I mean obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I'm</font>

751
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:39,618
going to take the easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> way out I'll</font>

752
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:43,560
point to Chris again thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you brother</font>

753

754
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:54,389
with the broader community the 303

755
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:56,069

00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:24,810
audience here no too early my beard

799
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:26,520
leagues its own life it has its own

800
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:35,670
Twitter account which i<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't actually</font>

801
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:37,790
control that's that's true so I so need

802
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,990
the little faint little game we play

803
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:43,410
older or younger than Jack's beard

804
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:46,109
December of 1979's last time I shaved I

805
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:48,930
only did that because I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a rental</font>

806
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:50,990
and the stove pilot kept going out and

807
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:53,700
one day I through the stove door open

808
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:55,109
and it lit from and the only way I could

809
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,370
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the smell of burnt hair out of my</font>

810
00:37:55,110 --> 00:38:00,090
face is that so otherwise it would have

811
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:01,770
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 16 months older and so it just</font>

812
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:04,410
leads its life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know it feeds</font>

813
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:06,870
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> of whatever mrs. my mouth when I try</font>

814
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:09,720
to eat and drink and<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you can tell I</font>

815
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:11,759
miss a lot because it's well fed and the

816
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,890
one thing is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what what the</font>

817
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,930
regional equivalent or maybe if they're

818
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:17,040
here tractor supply or general tractor

819
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:20,370
or wherever you get your equestrian

820
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:24,410
supplies go into the equestrian section

821
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:27,029
and they have cowboy magic shampoo

822
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:29,940
cowboy magic conditioner and then they

823
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:34,080
have cowboy magic detangler and the

824
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:37,230
detangler is magical it's just magical

825
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:39,960
makes sign and glow and detangle and

826
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:41,310
it's just it's and it makes people

827
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,960
fondle your beard when you're walking

828
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:46,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">around in Vegas which is really weird</font>

829
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,540
but the you know it's I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am I've been</font>

830
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:51,480
married<font color="#E5E5E5"> over 36 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I am a very</font>

831
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,830
faithful husband my beard objects<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

832
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,430
that at times when we're in Vegas

833
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,430
together but

834
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:16,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">here we go again a the Mohawk would be</font>

835
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:17,869
kind of sad at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yeah when</font>

836
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,259
it gets bad enough I will do the

837
00:39:17,869 --> 00:39:27,260
comb-over I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't look worse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

838
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:41,539
that thing on Trump's head all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right any</font>

839
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:45,440
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sir so what's the</font>

840
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:48,410
same and what's different<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of the</font>

841
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,510
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that as an</font>

842
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:52,399
organizer I see a lot is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the de role of</font>

843
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:56,210
sponsors and the engagement level of

844
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:59,390
sponsors Germans don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like sponsors in</font>

845
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:01,670
their face<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so they have a very</font>

846
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:03,680
subtle role and unfortunately means the

847
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,579
sponsors aren't is involved unless they

848
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,950
have people at are really part of

849
00:40:04,579 --> 00:40:11,569
community other places in Asia for

850
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,980
example sponsors need to be a very

851

853
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:19,759
huge sweeping generalizations as far as

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community some places have a more</font>

855
00:40:19,759 --> 00:40:24,259
cohesive sense of community when we move

856
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:27,980
when we have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> event there other places</font>

857
00:40:24,259 --> 00:40:31,460
don't have a sense of community<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

858

00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:37,609
night we're all going to get together

863
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,859
places where it is made a profound

864
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,180
difference and it depends on one of the

865
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:46,009
things one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a void</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

866
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,598
are places where the b-sides are you

867
00:40:46,009 --> 00:40:49,730
know they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but they have a</font>

868
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,410
healthy community and it's just another

869
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:54,529
piece of it other places where there

870
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:56,808
isn't a strong sense of community it

871
00:40:54,529 --> 00:41:00,030
brings people<font color="#E5E5E5"> out where they wouldn't</font>

872
00:40:56,809 --> 00:41:03,090
normally get the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of unfiltered and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">an honest conversation a couple of</font>

00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:09,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that come to mind are warsaw and</font>

875
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:13,950
algiers college students put those on

876
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:15,000
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it was great they did</font>

877
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,919
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a couple of years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and graduated</font>

878
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,360
and went into consulting practice and

879
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,820
brought more college students in and so

880
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:23,330
now the you know the local security

881
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:27,450
community has this pipeline from

882
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:29,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">university to the industry based on the</font>

883
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:32,730
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've built Michigan was</font>

884
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:33,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">ripe for a catalyst Doug song got up and</font>

885
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:35,850
says how come we're I'll have it the

886
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,560
first b-sides Detroit why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all in</font>

887
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:39,690
this room together we don't know each

888
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">other like I know you you know him but</font>

889
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:44,040
why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> why don't we know each other</font>

890
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:46,260
and at night they set an IRC channel

891
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:49,710
they started connecting and the whole

892
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:52,080
Michigan security my sec thing that was

893
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:54,300
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sparks that catalyzed that</font>

894
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:57,569
and so it depends on whether there's a

895
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,520
big sense of community and they tend to

896
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:00,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">reflect the local community the one in</font>

897
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,460
Austin tends to be a little weird

898
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:04,980
although now they've grown to where they

899
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:07,920
have to be more structured the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

902
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:18,540
unlimited alcohol flowing and live music

903
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:21,390
because it's austin right<font color="#E5E5E5"> san francisco</font>

910
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:41,370
work well it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> because people connect</font>

and share you know that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

was know that yes yep so one of the

913
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,330
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't get as much credit</font>

914
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,680
as she deserves and I should have

915

<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned earlier so thank you for that</font>

916
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,399
because it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remind me to say</font>

917
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:07,200
Michelle<font color="#CCCCCC"> clinger is the person who stays</font>

918
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,270
on top of events around the world she

919
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">talks to most of the new organizers</font>

920
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:13,038
coaches them I pick up the slack on a

921
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:15,049
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those depending</font>

922
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:20,390
where we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> since they are global time</font>

923
00:43:15,049 --> 00:43:21,650
zones and whatever also who they are but

924
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:24,259
she picks up most<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that the other</font>

925
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:29,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing that Michelle and I do is we deal</font>

926
00:43:24,259 --> 00:43:36,109
with events that have opportunities for

927
00:43:29,299 --> 00:43:40,219
improvement overly commercial events for

928
00:43:36,109 --> 00:43:41,749
the sponsors or vendors is a danger and

929
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:44,479
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is based on community</font>

930
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:47,839
sensibilities and we will you know have

931
00:43:44,479 --> 00:43:51,618
a conversation about it I won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> name uni</font>

932
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:55,130
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one last fall that people</font>

933
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:57,499
thought was overly commercialized in

934
00:43:55,130 --> 00:44:00,769
defense of them what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> is they</font>

935
00:43:57,499 --> 00:44:04,160
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up short on sponsorship so the guy</font>

936
00:44:00,769 --> 00:44:07,910
who was<font color="#CCCCCC"> lead organizer convinced his</font>

937
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,868
company to fill in all the holes and so

938
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:13,788
that company was overly well represented

939
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:16,039
and so it was legitimate complaint they

940
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:18,259
had a rational reason and he was the

941
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:19,609
organizer was as frustrated by that once

942
00:44:18,259 --> 00:44:25,939
we got in a conversation with him as

943
00:44:19,609 --> 00:44:28,719
others yeah and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into the</font>

944
00:44:25,939 --> 00:44:32,629
really ugly stuff which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the session</font>

945
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:35,479
when b-sides grow you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people change</font>

946
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:37,159
jobs in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this industry we move people do</font>

947
00:44:35,479 --> 00:44:38,479
things you know ridiculous<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

948
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:43,009
get married<font color="#CCCCCC"> and have kids and get</font>

949
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:44,598
divorced and have pets and buy

950
00:44:43,009 --> 00:44:46,819
motorcycles and decide they're on the

951
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:48,709
wrong side of the continent or you know

952
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:51,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">heaven forbid buy a boat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and decide that</font>

953
00:44:48,709 --> 00:44:55,489
it's moored in the wrong ocean whatever

954
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:57,499
and if there isn't some thought into how

955
00:44:55,489 --> 00:45:00,199
you take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> b-sides and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this applies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

956
00:44:57,499 --> 00:45:02,598
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if there isn't some</font>

957
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:04,699
thought into<font color="#E5E5E5"> succession there isn't some</font>

958
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:07,909
thought into how your kids<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to</font>

959
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:11,390
inherit your house it gets ugly and

960
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:13,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually the worst event problems we've</font>

961
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:16,939
added then and people trying to take

962
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:19,849
over try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand off and when we get</font>

963
00:45:16,939 --> 00:45:21,140
conflicts over you know territorial

964
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:24,559
conflicts

965
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:25,759
usually in a secession case in Michelle

966
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:27,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I and sometimes some of the others</font>

967
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,559
on the board get involved and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

968
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:32,509
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> my role and I try to be</font>

969
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:35,269
conciliatory and I try to be calm and

970
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:37,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">use the perspective of being you know</font>

having been a dad for 35 years and doing

these things and having some perspective

973
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:44,059
on life and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will admit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are times</font>

00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:45,410
when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to grab people by the</font>

977
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:52,819
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do that so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the and</font>

978
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:56,328
it's thankfully rare but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things do</font>

979
00:45:52,819 --> 00:46:04,450
happen I mean we're talking about 251

980
00:45:56,329 --> 00:46:04,450
events around the world I you went there

981
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:10,609
yes oh yes oh for those that don't know

982
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:13,848
originally there were three<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us who</font>

983
00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:16,220
sort of were floating around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the core of</font>

984
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:20,269
the b-sides thing once we realized it

985
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:24,640
wasn't just one event and it was it was

986
00:46:20,269 --> 00:46:28,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chris and myself and Mike Don and we all</font>

have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> views of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world and</font>

988
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:31,729
the cool thing about that was when we

989
00:46:30,529 --> 00:46:33,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">agreed it was cool because if you</font>

990
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:35,059
convinced the three of us assholes that

991
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:39,019
you were on the right path quick okay

992
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:40,670
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and I and Chris it's like if</font>

993
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:42,319
you think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's okay</font>

994
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:45,559
and he thinks it's okay it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably ok</font>

995
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:47,900
but don't people go in different

996
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:53,240
directions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we had some</font>

997
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:55,759
frustrations and it they were legitimate

998
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:58,910
frustrations over how we handle finance

999
00:46:55,759 --> 00:47:01,490
/ how we handled promotion and it is why

1000
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:03,740
besides global is a small organization

1001
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:05,288
<font color="#E5E5E5">now instead of a large</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> organization</font>

1002
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:08,598
which runs events besides global

1003
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:11,809
basically does mentorship and and brand

1004
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:13,369
management including recently doing

1005
00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:15,980
trademark<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's what we do because</font>

1006
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:17,569
the decision was<font color="#CCCCCC"> made by uh by some of</font>

1007
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:20,750
us directly and by the community<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

1008
00:47:17,569 --> 00:47:23,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">large we don't want the global org to</font>

1009
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:25,910
run Vegas and San Francisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> and be part</font>

1010
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,439
of run in Austin and whatever because

1011
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:29,450
then we're competing with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1012
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,480
parent body and so what happens is

1013
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:34,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">b-side San Francisco if they run surplus</font>

1014
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,080
little money rolls over

1015
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:39,720
pay the hosting bills and accountant

1016
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:42,720
bills for<font color="#E5E5E5"> b-sides global so we had we</font>

1017
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:45,750
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one and that took a lot and we</font>

1018
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:49,140
were all unhappy with each other at some

1019
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:51,300
level and some of us knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font>

1020
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,770
unhappy but agree it completely

1021
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:56,040
understood why the other one felt the

1022
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:59,250
way they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did and some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of us are still</font>

1023
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:06,900
friends and some are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not but that's life</font>

1024
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:08,130
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know worry they all worked great</font>

1025
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,600
great and they're a couple of events

1026
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:10,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that spun off because I didn't want you</font>

1027
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,600
know they they thought the name was

1028
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:13,800
going to melt down and so there's some

1029
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,660
events that I think are great events

1030
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,550
cactus con just coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up really soon in</font>
