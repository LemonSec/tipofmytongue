00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,650
talk about the elevator hacking and I've

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,310
seen this talk a couple times myself

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:33,079
it's very entertaining very

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:46,040

elevator consultant and way more

24
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:15,320
responsible and knowledgeable in this

<font color="#E5E5E5">field than I ever could have been if I</font>

hadn't met him<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm really grateful</font>

27
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,969
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he reached out to me he saw me</font>

28
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:22,100
giving a talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about big buildings once</font>

29
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:24,259
hotels<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the like and I mentioned a</font>

30
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,669
little bit about elevators and do just

31
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:27,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">got in touch he was like man you have no</font>

32
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea this industry does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it take security</font>

33
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:32,810
seriously at all so we started to have a

34
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:35,809
good time with it speaking of not taking

35
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,210
things seriously hackers sometimes don't

36
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">take things seriously now elevators are</font>

37
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,469
generally safe elevators actually are

38
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,880
not responsible for injuries all that

39
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,740
often when they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> their minor there</font>

40
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,439
you know trip and fall of something miss

41
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,030
levels at a landing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times in a</font>

42
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,908
given year that people are injured by

43
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,259
elevators grievously they're usually

44
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:57,439
proper elevator techs who are working on

45
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:59,420
them at the time so that said there are

46
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,798
numerous failure modes that can occur

47
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,170
with elevators that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will involve</font>

48
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,670
grievous bodily harm if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> screw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

49
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,829
with elevators because you think this

50
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,530
was a funny talk or cool or like I can

51
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:11,150
totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that I am not responsible if</font>

52
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">you like you know trap your leg between</font>

53
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,890
the door sill and a landing sale or

54
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like that alright downer stuff</font>

55
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,850
aside most of you are not that stupid

56
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,970
most of you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just mischievous</font>

57
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:25,579
it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> break or damage or foul</font>

58
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,230
up an<font color="#CCCCCC"> elevator by messing around with it</font>

59
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,240
in ways you shouldn't be now just

60
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,709
because you're smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough to not rip</font>

61
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:41,450
an arm off it doesn't mean you're not

62
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:43,220
facing like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> felony criminal something</font>

63
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,980
as simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> as that if you don't know what</font>

64
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:49,730
you're doing can cause tens of thousands

65
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,590
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in damage this person wound</font>

66
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,780
up with a felony charge just for trying

67
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:58,160
to you know helicopter himself on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

68
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,690
and snapping the entire like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Saturday if</font>

69
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,130
you don't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing you</font>

70
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,359
probably shouldn't be doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it unless</font>

71
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,730
it's in a controlled and safe

72
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,500
environment so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are we are security</font>

73
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,060
professionals or at least Howard is I

74
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,640
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of tag along and</font>

75
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,260
axially as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you follow that rule</font>

76
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,630
just you know don't be a jackwagon

77
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,030
you're probably fine with this and most

78
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">other kinds of hacking right so really</font>

79
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,600
quick we're not going to break down the

80
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">every possible type of elevator system</font>

81
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,840
that's out there if you saw the very

82
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,250
first time<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this at the</font>

83
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,780
hope conference in New York how many

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">people get to hackers on planet earth</font>

86
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,660
all right you should come it's coming up

87
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,850
this summer it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good time it's</font>

88
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,470
an interesting time it's where we first

89
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal like a two-hour long talk and we</font>

90
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,770
got weighed in the nitty-gritty of every

91
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,540
elevator system i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give you</font>

92
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,310
just some basics so you understand what

93
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,890
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about here there are</font>

94
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,960
essentially two types of elevator

95
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,640
propulsion systems there's overhead

96
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,080
traction where you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine room</font>

97
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,910
up on the penthouse way above the

98
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,950
elevator using cables to hoist and

99
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,630
there's beneath threat there's beneath

100
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,310
pressure from a piston from a hydraulic

101
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,260
system usually the motor room will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

102
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">the basement on a lot of those those</font>

103
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,950
fundamentally are your two methods of

104
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:06,380
driving and elevator around a building

105
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,940
and you notice there's a penthouse motor

106
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,950
room or like a basement motor room the

107
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:12,140
motor itself the power of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> elevator</font>

108
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,209
is not like in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cab there's an</font>

109
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,479
external machine Oh machine driving this

110
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:20,000
the cab itself is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just floating</font>

111
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,040
along in the hoistway on some guide

112
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,020
rails and some rollers just letting

113
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,700
itself be centered and aligned as

114
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,950
another machine somewhere else in the

115
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">building drives it up and down now how</font>

116
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,729
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you interacting with the elevator</font>

117
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:33,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">well industry terminology you need to</font>

118
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,149
know is fixtures there are all kinds of

119
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:36,709
fixtures there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> travelling lanterns</font>

120
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,629
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> hall lanterns there's of course</font>

121
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,789
the car operating panel which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

122
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:42,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">you input all of your cab calls there's</font>

123
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:44,359
the you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hall buttons there's</font>

124
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:46,399
all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixtures most of which are</font>

125
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:48,829
just push buttons also<font color="#E5E5E5"> incorporating</font>

126
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,899
some key switches talk about them that

127
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:53,659
is how you send<font color="#E5E5E5"> commands</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the motor</font>

128
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:55,459
room in the motor room obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> we said</font>

129
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:57,739
earlier we got some big winding hoist

130
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:59,689
motors up here you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have pumps in a</font>

131
00:04:57,739 --> 00:05:02,179
hydraulic room not as sexy but in either

132
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:04,309
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are interacting with you are</font>

133
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:05,899
sending commands to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> controller the</font>

134
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:08,089
controller is the brains of the system

135
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:10,339
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what takes all the input logic</font>

136
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:12,379
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> you as well as from a number of</font>

137
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:14,149
other sensors puts it all together and

138
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:16,539
makes decisions about how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive that</font>

139
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:18,619
elevator up and down in the hoistway

140
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:19,699
what other positions you know what other

141
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:21,529
sensors can you have while there's

142
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:23,479
positioning sensors right the elevator

143
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:25,099
needs to know where it is these are

144
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:26,568
roller switches known as limit switches

145
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:28,279
so as the elevator is getting close to

trip these switches<font color="#CCCCCC"> their simple dry</font>

148
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:34,009

149
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:35,688
input saying okay we're hitting slow

152
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:41,029
you notice there's a fourth one there

153
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:42,679
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh god you completely shot</font>

154
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:44,929
past the final landing you're on the

155
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:46,399
final limit stop motor now like that's

156
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:48,409
an error condition that you can you know

157
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,779
have happen in an elevator the elevator

158
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:52,938
itself has what's known as a selector

159
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:55,610
when you are traveling up and down the

160
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:58,639
hoistway this device on the car itself

161
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,679
is taking input usually from a magnetic

162
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,569
style tape there are older magnetic

163
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:05,239
veins there's newer ones that use QR

164

code which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> dumb but in general the</font>

165
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:09,409

where it is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hoistway and we'll</font>

167
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:13,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about what happens if that input</font>

very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very wrong there are other machines</font>

170
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:19,429
other devices up in the motor room that

171
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:21,679
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the governors and the braking</font>

systems here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see an old-time gut ball</font>

00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:25,818
governor we see a rope gripper

174
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:27,469
unintended movement elevators are really

175
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,599
good at arresting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that movement upward</font>

176
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:32,539
or downward travel so elevators

177
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:34,849
generally keep you very safe if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

178
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:37,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes super wrong there's even the buffer</font>

00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:38,869
down in the pit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that giant spring</font>

00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">that normally the elevator shouldn't</font>

contact that but it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> rated to to</font>

withstand the

fully at full<font color="#E5E5E5"> travel speed so if you</font>

192
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:06,030
weird if the elevators on automatic mode

193
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:08,669
elevators are exceedingly safe now there

194

are<font color="#CCCCCC"> other modes of service maybe you've</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">been in a building somebody just tweeted</font>

196
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,979
at us the other day they said hey why is

197
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,030
this elevator SE non stop am I you know

198
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,200
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> had they tweeted a photo well</font>

199
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,599
that's something called attendant mode

200
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,150
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> different levels of permission</font>

201
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,430
you can get in an elevators cab if you

202
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,020
know how to unlock certain modes mostly

203
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,750
it involves just flipping switches key

204
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,760
switches or manual switches so attendant

205
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,680
service if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have someone in an</font>

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,430
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide boy this elevator is</font>

208
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,469
full of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> we probably shouldn't be</font>

209
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,420
collecting more calls further up this

this photo similar function that's going

214
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,130
to zoom past any floor landings that

215
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,630
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> registered calls it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

hey this elevator is really crowded

221
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,330
let's get down to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lobby hey check it</font>

222
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,680
out a switch let's flip it I mean yeah

223
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,330
this is what happens on<font color="#CCCCCC"> attendant</font>

224
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,490
service mode it's also what happens if

225
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:11,310
you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> special key some buildings</font>

226
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,350
are designed to not need an attendant in

227
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,270
the cab but to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> Big Shot people this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">mostly in a convenience way we'll talk</font>

about elevator systems you're totally

registering all kind of inputs with the

we're overweight somebody get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out fat</font>

287
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,180
ass like I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really heavy and</font>

288
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,000
like that was usually my fault in

289
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,520
elevators right elevators know how heavy

290
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,170
they are you can use that input to your

291
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,420
advantage in the controller if the load

292
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,610
sensor says boy this elevator is really

293
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,079
full and I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to collect more of</font>

294
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,270
these Hall calls that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> registered on</font>

295
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,310
eight other floors I should probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

296
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:31,350
do that I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go wherever it's</font>

297
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,790
going usually the lobby<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get everyone</font>

298
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,380
the hell out so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to be</font>

299
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">that elevator that platforms are like</font>

300
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,439
every floor and the door is<font color="#CCCCCC"> open and</font>

301
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,660
you're standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> there with a bunch of</font>

302
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,370
other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry like</font>

303
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,770
you can enable this kind of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

304
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,050
your building moving around faster you

305
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">can enable anti nuisance modes where if</font>

306
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,920
somebody presses all the buttons too

307
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,720
quickly or if it detects no passenger

308
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,520
has broken the beam on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the door</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sensor</font>

309
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,230
so that like boy why did we just get

310
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,390
eighth floor calls when no one got on

311
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,520
the elevator you can totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that</font>

312
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,660
sorry to prevention

313
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,699
to get people keep going<font color="#CCCCCC"> around a</font>

314
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,170
building brands das this is an anti

315
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,850
nuisance elevator where we just tried

316
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,650
that's amazing press all the buttons and

317
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,990
the elevator was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> lull nope and it</font>

318
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:13,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just dump the calls all out 23 and</font>

319
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:15,420
boom out I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

320
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,950
tells you where you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going a</font>

321
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,240
little fast by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we you</font>

322
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,920
know we waited for some people to get in

323
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,880
so I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're bearing with me on this</font>

324
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,370
stuff I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the good stuff</font>

325
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,200
later I said the selector tells you

326
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,180
where tells the elevator where it is in

327
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,700
its travel there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something called a</font>

328
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,410
correction run again this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

329
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,700
a security implementation but it's

330
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">really interesting if you've never</font>

331
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,530
experienced this if the elevator gets

332
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,599
mixed up on its inputs if the motor says

333
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,339
all right I've wound this far and my

334
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,830
motor generator my encoder says I've

335
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,600
gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> this far but the selector says no</font>

336
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,670
I've actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone three floors if the</font>

337
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,250
elevator<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of panics this is well why</font>

338
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:53,459
is this not matching up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the elevator can</font>

339
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,870
sometimes run at slow speed usually

340
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,090
inspection speed so it's like one

341
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,470
quarter normal speed and it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> park all</font>

342
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:01,050
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way at the bottom it'll travel the</font>

343
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:03,300
whole hoistway until it basically re

344
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,400
learns the hoistway and then it says

345
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I'm satisfied my inputs are</font>

346
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,850
matching again and all of a sudden poof

347
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,530
it just works normally and if you've

348
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,970
ever been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in an elevator that suddenly</font>

349
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,439
didn't go where you wanted it and then

350
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,760
when really<font color="#E5E5E5"> slowly like what has</font>

351
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,770
happened you start freaking out if

352
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,720
you're claustrophobic it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably just</font>

353
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,010
a correction run you should report that

354
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,990
to the building management if that

355
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,970
happens there's something went wrong but

356
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:27,570
the elevator tried to self-soothe and

357
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:29,040
there you go what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like these kind</font>

358
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,930
of buttons<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh what's halfway in between</font>

359
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,839
floors or something what's well no

360
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:36,030
there's all kind of odd quirks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

361
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,650
elevator industry if you add floors if

362
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,689
you have rear doors if a split-level

363
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:42,060
building is platforming at half floors

364
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,340
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of strange stuff you'll</font>

365
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,979
see especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the badges on the car</font>

366
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,960
operating panel totally tweet photos it

367
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,940
like me or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Howard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Payne we love that</font>

368
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,500
stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will usually how it'll</font>

369
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,540
explain it instantly he's like oh yeah

370
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,400
it's totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dover impulse system you</font>

371
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,599
can see it was modernized in 2007

372
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,800
because the nature<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

spew on<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter and your end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the person</font>

377
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,440
replies like wow how'd you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

378
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,569
was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> blurry photo totally the kind of</font>

379
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,910
stuff we love<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about we talked</font>

380
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,059
about peak mode obviously why is your

381
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,399
elevator

382
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:17,439
forming and parking itself at like the

383
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,449
top floor if it's the morning when

384
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:21,159
everyone's trying to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> up you can set</font>

385
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:22,718
the floors where the elevator<font color="#E5E5E5"> will idle</font>

386
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:25,629
and wait for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> at different times</font>

387
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:27,549
of the day stuff that's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

388
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:28,809
interesting not so much up here you

389
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:31,299
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of earthquakes up here</font>

390
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:33,939
right there are modes in an elevator

391
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:35,799
where it will detect<font color="#E5E5E5"> seismic unrest it</font>

392
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:38,049
will detect<font color="#E5E5E5"> if a building is swaying or</font>

393
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:40,179
shaking or vibrating maybe up<font color="#CCCCCC"> here you'd</font>

394
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:42,129
set it off with like blasting and stuff

395
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:43,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you do to extract minerals but if</font>

396
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:45,909
the elevator can detect problem

397
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:47,618
conditions again elevators are really

398
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,819
good at keeping you<font color="#E5E5E5"> alive they will go</font>

399
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:51,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the lobby they'll sit there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

400
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:52,779
their doors<font color="#E5E5E5"> open and they'll wait what</font>

401
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:54,639
if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different kind of unrest</font>

402
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:56,379
though because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a lot of irate</font>

403
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,499
hockey fans<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes what if you have</font>

404
00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:01,209
civil unrest there are error modes and

405
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:03,369
emergency modes that elevators can have

406
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:05,529
to not go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lobby there's literally</font>

407
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:07,299
a mode called riot mode and it's enabled

408
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:09,309
in some big like museums and other

409
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:11,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">places of culture where they want to</font>

410
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:13,269
protect much of the resource<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

411
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:15,309
whatever's in the building during unrest

412
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,979
outside in the streets the elevator will

413
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:20,439
literally run at normal operation<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

414
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:22,359
a building on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the upper floors will not</font>

415
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:24,159
platform at the lobby will not open its

doors for the lobby it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like let</font>

417
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,239
people storming in from the lobby get

418
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,859
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> building it's kind of neat</font>

419
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:31,269
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> rely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> however this is the</font>

420
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:33,489
first of our many points about don't

421
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:38,319
rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your elevator exclusively as a</font>

422
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:41,169
security protocol because there are

423
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:42,789
certain overrides in elevator systems

424
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:44,439
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are certain special modes not in</font>

there are interesting security blockages

466
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:07,360
that some buildings try to use for

00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:20,830
to lock the elevators I don't know if

474
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,630
you can override your elevator if it's

475
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,550
in baby theft mode if somebody has let's

495

strongly recommend you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look into if</font>

you're checking your security in your

own building independent service it is

498
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:13,089
far and away one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most common</font>

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,520
special modes it's built into most

00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:17,349
elevators even if you don't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> a key</font>

501
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,199
switch or a toggle switch it might be

00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:22,270
there behind a hidden panel independent

503
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:23,800
service here we see just manual toggle

504
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,199
switches for independent service it

505
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically gives you local admin rights</font>

511
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,190
building most of the time I've flipped

00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,290
independent service on an elevator

513
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:44,930
sure it has thrown those out the other

514
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:47,570
fun thing it also ignores all the hall

515
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:49,640
demand so if I'm in an elevator and I

516
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,679
flip<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to independent not only can I</font>

517
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,990
usually go to any floor even ones I

518
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,660
wasn't supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to but it'll sit there</font>

519
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:58,880
with its door shut until I<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell it open</font>

520
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:02,000
the doors I've hidden in elevators for

521
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,500
hours in like jobs where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of you</font>

522
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,470
know saunter our way in during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font>

523
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,240
nobody notices nobody's checking badges

524
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:10,190
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just taken an elevator turned it to</font>

525
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,530
independent<font color="#CCCCCC"> sat there for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four hours</font>

526
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,450
like texting<font color="#CCCCCC"> my friends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and catching up</font>

527
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,340
on Twitter waiting till the team outside

528
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,290
is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey looks like everyone's gone</font>

529
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,639
home for the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> deve so I'll Drive the</font>

530
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,020
elevator down to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lobby i'll just</font>

531
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,610
walk open the door and let everyone in

532
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,080
and it's the perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> hiding place</font>

533
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,179
because you know if you have a building

534
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,970
and the bank<font color="#E5E5E5"> of elevators is like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 wide</font>

535
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:30,440
no one is ever like going to lunch and

536
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,900
be like oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanna get some timber</font>

537
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> man hey have you noticed</font>

538
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:37,300
elevator<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 hasn't been responding all</font>

539
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,379
day suspicious like nobody says that

540
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,270
nobody's you get on the first elevator

541
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,010
that gets there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm like snickering</font>

542
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,090
away just some one time I rolled a chair

543
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,860
into the elevator to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have somewhere to</font>

544
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:48,199
sit there's like oh it's jaron gonna

545
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:50,270
take it downstairs and yeah like it's a

546
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,030
perfect hidey hole that most buildings

547
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:54,590
have and you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not realize that what</font>

548
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:56,210
is more powerful than independent

549
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,120
service though because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say it it</font>

550
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:01,880
varies how the commands are stacked up

551
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,620
maybe a certain floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> cutout is still</font>

552
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,480
enabled even if you flip independent

553
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,120
because it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually not usually</font>

554
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,800
independent throws all that out

555
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,850
guaranteed to almost always throw out

556
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:15,740
all your security is fire service mode

557
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:18,919
fire service mode emergency responder

558
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,860
mode is by code part of almost every

559
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:24,170
elevator at least here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> North America</font>

560
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:26,120
by code you might have someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who says</font>

561
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,500
I demand that floor seven is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

562
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,929
center<font color="#CCCCCC"> and no one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you need a badge and</font>

you this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that the boss can have all</font>

564
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,870
the demands he or she wants in the

565
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,669
elevator tech can try to program the

566
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,199
elevator all the way you want all that

567

somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this goes for old and new</font>

570
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,910
systems so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> even see elevators</font>

571
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,250
that they'll get retrofit they'll get

572
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,900
modernized it's called and all of a

573
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,420
sudden if you like look to the side view

574
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,130
here you can see this elevator on this

575
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,330
side didn't used to have all the same

576
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,130
fire controls

577
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:57,290
now they've got an extra panel that was

578
00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:00,800
put in to come up to compliance this is

579
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:02,960
code compliance stuff the idea that in

580
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,820
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> emergency if the elevator thinks the</font>

581
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,830
building has a fire condition a smoker

582
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:09,290
heat condition which you can totally

583
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,610
fake either by exploiting what's called

584
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,920
the back net we won't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get into</font>

585
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">that or by manually throwing an elevator</font>

586
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">into fire service mode which you can do</font>

587
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,270
and usually it does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> result in alarms</font>

588
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:22,280
going off you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely gain the</font>

589
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:25,280
powers that an emergency responder would

590
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,440
have in an emergency situation which

591
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,800
means no security stops for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all</font>

592
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,410
floors accessible go where you want by

593
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,000
the way there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one more powerful mode</font>

594
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,740
than fire service mode it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

595
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,840
crazy like who could<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibly be more</font>

596
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,490
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a thin like a fire crew</font>

597
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:44,090
and emergency responder crew any any

598
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:46,130
ideas yeah yeah the elevator text of

599
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,780
cells there's elevator technician

600
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,640
service mode there is it's called

601
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,950
hoistway mode<font color="#E5E5E5"> also sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font>

602
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,140
inspection service mode and it is

603
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly that it is for getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

hoistway and moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> around in the</font>

00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,170
hoistway to either inspect things

00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,720
service things adjust things you name it

607
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:05,120
if you are in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoistway if you are</font>

608
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,850
running on inspection service running an

609
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,389
inspection speed is slow but it throws

610
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:13,370
everything out the window every possible

611
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:15,020

613
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,520
ever heard of outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe some</font>

614
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,250
crazy spooky federal buildings other

615
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,480
than that like everything is yours to do

616
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,120
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want with if you're in the</font>

617
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,700
hoistway hoist ways are effing dangerous

618
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,889
you and i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking to like all of you</font>

619
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,650
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't belong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the hoistway</font>

620
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,970
you can find little<font color="#E5E5E5"> panels and access</font>

621
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,430
shoots and things if you do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

622
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:40,790
urban exploring<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do not recommend you</font>

623
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:43,010
ever go near this stuff now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> said if</font>

624
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:45,200
someone does there are run controls in

625
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,780
the hoistway there on the car top you're

626
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that later you should not</font>

627
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">be screwing around with this if you</font>

628
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:53,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know the industry because this</font>

629
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:56,840
industry again like if you're not from

630
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,909
this industry these<font color="#E5E5E5"> key switch right</font>

631
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,010
here this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> motor generator shut</font>

632
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,600
down key switch that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you need to</font>

633
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:05,240
take one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the motors just out of</font>

634
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,939
service if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to turn it off how</font>

635
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,740
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you turn shutdown</font>

636
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:12,010
mode on in this elevator will you turn

637
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,690
shut down to on like that's the kind of

638
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,610
thinking that you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and if</font>

639
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,140
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bizarre as industry on</font>

640
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:18,969
some of its controls if you don't know

641
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,310
how things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are working you shouldn't be</font>

642
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,840
messing around with them let me instead

643
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,300
show you us messing around with them and

644
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,740
then you can take this knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

645
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,970
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> various</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds of elevator</font>

646
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,560
securities<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have been implemented</font>

647
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,540
trying to prevent people from moving

648
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,480
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> a building they can usually all</font>

649
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,670
be subverted so disabling your ability

650
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,050
to just call an elevator is common it's

651
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">common in a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of schools and other</font>

652
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,440
environments where like the teachers can

653
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,780
use the elevator but the kids can't I

654
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,580
see it in airports a lot of the time so

655
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,940
either there's just no hall call buttons

656
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:50,409
or they're disabled by a switch now you

657
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,030
might have like a maybe even in a hotel

658
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,220
where like this was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little holiday and</font>

659
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:56,020
I stayed at it looks like that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

660
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,820
button but it's not this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a light</font>

661
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,340
an indicator light the only way to get

662
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:02,770
the elevator<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to throw my key card for</font>

663
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,379
my room into it it latches a call the

664
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:07,360
elevator arrives now you notice there

665
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,550
was another key switch right near that

666
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,060
button that wasn't a button right what

667
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:15,280
key switch was it it was red yeah that's

668
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,990
the fire control switch you can manually

669
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,639
throw the elevator that exact elevator

670
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,490
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> fire service mode and it would</font>

671
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,680
platform right away<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you to here is a</font>

672
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:25,870
little pin pad based system again the

673
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,010
floor call won't be registered the hall

674
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,020
call won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be registered unless you have</font>

675
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:31,300
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin this is in an airport what is</font>

676
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,830
right below it a regular key switch that

677
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,830
either turns on or turns off that

678
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:38,169
functionality you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have seen key</font>

679
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:40,449
switches in the cab these are called

680
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:42,340
floor cutouts so the idea of floor three

681
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,940
floor for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can manually toggle them</font>

682
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:47,679
on or off these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not series circuit</font>

683
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,930
like you're breaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the circuit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

684
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,520
operates that push button remember if a

685
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,320
fire responder gets in the elevator they

686
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,030
don't have time to figure out which

687
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,669
floors are unlocked and locked and like

688
00:23:55,030 --> 00:24:00,040
mess with 18 keys this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all logic</font>

689
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:01,990
gates and just because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the logic gate is</font>

690
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,760
closed by one switch the button still

691
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:06,430
works the controller is either ignoring

692
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,920
it or allowing it based on what you are

693
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:10,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what's special</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mode you're in</font>

694
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,370
independent mode usually throws all

695
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,820
these out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the window fire service mode</font>

696
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:17,530
always throws all these out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the window</font>

697
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,570
the most typical elevator restriction

698
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:20,440
you'll usually see involves key card

699
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,960
systems right

700
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,250
so like big hotels posh hotels where you

701
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,720
can't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to sir I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the hotel</font>

702
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,400
i'm staying at Jack you and I are Thea

703
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,650
where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fairfield and we need our</font>

704
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,200
little khabar<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFID key to get up to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

705
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:34,000
our floors there's absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font>

706
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:37,540
around that if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> elevator is running</font>

707
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,750
in special modes of operation think of

708
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,950
physically securing your elevator as

709
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:46,240
literally<font color="#CCCCCC"> something you would have to do</font>

710
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:48,100
like this like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

711
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,840
corrections environment and this is the

712
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">only thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would consider a very</font>

713
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,030
secured elevator the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of caging off</font>

714
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,740
the elevator why am I like that's a

715
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,030
goofy-looking photo and it's a photo in

716
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,710
our slide deck because Howard was there

717
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,810
investigating an accident somebody

718
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:03,490
actually stepped off the elevator and I

719
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:05,110
think the hoistway<font color="#CCCCCC"> door is closed like</font>

720
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:06,340
and then they were pinned in like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

721
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">one foot space and they couldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

722
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,889
anywhere because they forgot<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

723
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,060
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what the hell</font>

724
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,800
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were doing they were maybe they</font>

725
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,360
were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to escape but anyway you can</font>

726
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,760
sue anybody in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> freaking country so</font>

727
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,469
there they were taking photos of this

728
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,000
but why am I saying this is like

729
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,970
securing your elevator well think of

730
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,970
your elevators as just a giant open

731
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:27,280
stairway in your building and not

732
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:28,420
lockable and what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> about to see in</font>

733
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,720
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next few slides should hopefully</font>

734
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,460
reinforce that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of my elevator</font>

735
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,900
is providing these security is something

736
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,030
that you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to wipe out of your</font>

737
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:39,040
brain and while you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to make</font>

738
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,320
like a cage around your elevator<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

739
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,820
stairwell analogy is valid and if you

740
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,970
want a really secure environment like

741
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:48,070
vestibule<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ling off the elevator landing</font>

742
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:49,570
area the elevator lobby landing like

743
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:53,139
that's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> best course of action for</font>

744
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:54,520
really secure floors so how can we

745
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,740
subvert just about everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just</font>

746
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,870
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about their well when there's no</font>

747
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:01,740
Hulk all buttons this is a funny little

748
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,739
video from a school

749
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,169
we see what happened there let's watch

750
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,169
the video

751
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:19,590
what the hell person<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody see what</font>

752
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:20,910
they did shout it out yeah they stuck an

753
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:23,040
envelope or a paper through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> door</font>

754
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:24,300
they tripped the door<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensor the door</font>

755
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,830
sensor<font color="#E5E5E5"> which will not work all the time</font>

756
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,990
right but the elevator happened to be

757
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">platform dat that floor and they just</font>

758
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,660
tripped the door<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensor into popping</font>

759
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,860
open because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like oh so there's an</font>

760
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,470
obstruction in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> doorway let me open</font>

761
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:37,350
my doors that completely works in a lot

762
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">of environments is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me recommending</font>

763
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:41,790
that you just stick stuff randomly

764
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:44,130
through closed hoistway doors no no you

765
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:47,820
misinterpreted me sir no no don't do

766
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:49,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the key</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cards that the key cards</font>

767
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,330
are super common in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of buildings</font>

768
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:53,639
right so key card systems allowing you

769
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:56,730
access never discount the possibility

770
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,380
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there might be a little locked</font>

771
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,880
panel and let's see here we've got it i

772
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,560
can write<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can register a call to</font>

773
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,210
senators<font color="#CCCCCC"> shovin but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think the top</font>

774
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:06,060
floor in this building<font color="#E5E5E5"> for more locked</font>

775
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,740
out so let's try like let's say 33 yeah

776
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,060
can't get up there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need that's a badge</font>

777
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,490
reader right there but what's below the

778
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:13,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">barrier well there's a little panel and</font>

779
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:15,900
literally a switch that says card reader

780
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:18,209
off

781
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,040
yay good moon card reader no longer

782
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:21,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessary and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can even flip the</font>

783
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,060
switch back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and reenable that load</font>

784
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,620
already latched the<font color="#E5E5E5"> call you can tell</font>

785
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,690
this is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Otis Elevator it's actually</font>

786
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:30,060
noticed series<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven elevator is it all</font>

787
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:32,540
be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> p.m. 30 key that's on that lok pal</font>

788
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:36,360
why do I know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stuff well</font>

789
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:39,840
because most elevators in default keying

790
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,669
on all of their fixtures they come from

791
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> factory you need a certain way</font>

792
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:46,110
that's name brands off brands third

793
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,970
market<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brandt their party market brands</font>

794
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,979
like an aftermarket brands if you've

795
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,150
never checked this stuff out and a lot

796
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,820
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the industry don't even</font>

797
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:56,220
realize that completely possible that

798
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,540
you might have default keys for your

799
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,830
building it's like it's not changing

800
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">your passwords on router that you</font>

801
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,639
installed in your building so yeah we're

802
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:04,830
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know riding all the way up to</font>

803
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,580
the top for getting some free whatever

804
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:11,220
snacks or liquor was at this crazy bar

805
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:14,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">something so yeah like literally card</font>

806
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,470
reader<font color="#CCCCCC"> on/off totally exists as a thing</font>

807
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:18,450
in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of card reader based elevators</font>

808
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,920
here it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in another elevator this is</font>

809
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,410
in Las Vegas<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what you think</font>

810
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,660
security is a serious thing here's more

811
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:26,130
toggle switches<font color="#E5E5E5"> in other elevators these</font>

812
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,380
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> switches which are sometimes</font>

813
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:30,810
behind locked panels sometimes behind

814
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,030
hidden panels if you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them</font>

815
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:35,520
there are a lot of ways of triggering

816
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:37,320
other modes of operation interestingly

817
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,180
enough and you'll start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see this in</font>

818
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,429
some of the pictures people in the

819
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:43,560
elevator industry often don't realize

820
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:45,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">that these keys are repeating themselves</font>

821
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,730
you'll sometimes even see like Howard

822
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,590
calls this elevator graffiti when

823
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:52,410
elevator text will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like oh the run</font>

824
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:54,600
stop is<font color="#CCCCCC"> khone one and the independent is</font>

825
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:56,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">khone for it looks like fire service</font>

826
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,669
mode phase<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and two is that's an</font>

827
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,020
innovations key switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> cx-5 15 so people</font>

828
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:03,540
are like scratching down notes to

829
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,520
themselves which keys work<font color="#E5E5E5"> where well</font>

830
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:07,170
Howard when he's worked in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this industry</font>

831
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,790
for year after year after year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

832
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:11,520
way his brain is kind of funny like some

833
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:14,639
of ours<font color="#CCCCCC"> is he just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started logging all</font>

834
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:17,580
these keys and then collecting all these

835
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,960
keys and now like Murdock monkeys

836
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,370
holding a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know one of our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key</font>

837
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,470
sets up here not<font color="#E5E5E5"> nearly as big as</font>

838
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:24,840
Howard's<font color="#CCCCCC"> right but we have the default</font>

839
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:26,790
keys for basically every brand of

840
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,560
fixture and elevator system that exists

841
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,799
out there there's not there's like a lot

842
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,960
of names this industry there's not

843
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:33,668
at many names and if you're on it like a

844
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,860
pen test job like me or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh</font>

845
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:37,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">novella for any of our team we will send</font>

846
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,639
photos to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Howard like we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> debt we're</font>

847
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,869
texting and we're like dude tell me what

848
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:42,399
this is he's like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it is</font>

849
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:43,658
it's a slightly concave button it has

850
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,518
the indicator on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's a</font>

851
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:46,720
Schindler like I didn't know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font>

852
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:49,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">like yes you did you should listen to me</font>

853
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,679
more so yeah like we there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

854
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:53,169
fixtures right but you can start

855
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:56,169
identifying them recognizing them and

moving around the building more

885
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:55,749
efficiently every one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those has to be</font>

888
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,619
destination dispatch elevator has a

889
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,908
hidden panel with all of the floor call

890
00:31:02,619 --> 00:31:05,379
floor buttons there<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can</font>

even locked out sometimes if you pop

893
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,989
that panel you can just start<font color="#CCCCCC"> ret like I</font>

894
00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:12,639
can go to 42 right there just it just

895
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:15,549
latches a call like it's a conventional

896
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:17,498
elevator controller but forget about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

897
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:19,480
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> cutting-edge stuff this is an</font>

898
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:22,299
industry that's still really in the past

899
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:25,149
with most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> its controls so for example</font>

900
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:27,429
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all screenshots of elevator</font>

901
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:30,580
controller software does this look like

902
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:32,950
super ultra modern to you it looks just

903
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:34,749
modern enough to be throwing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on like</font>

904
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,220
an XP box on the network so you can

905
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:38,619
remote control it that's about it

906
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,999
they're running in dosbox environments

907
00:31:38,619 --> 00:31:41,889
they're running in really old windows

908
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:43,810
environments there this is the nature of

909
00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:45,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry though the idea</font>

910
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,530
oh wow we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could totally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put a</font>

911
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:49,270
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet chip on our controller</font>

912
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,470
board and I we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that thing hooked</font>

913
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,750
up to the network do some remote

914
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:55,060
management remote monitoring sounds

915
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:57,310
great remember this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an industry</font>

916
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:59,620
that focuses on security security to the

917
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:01,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">elevator industry means you not dying it</font>

918
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:05,050
doesn't mean you not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the wrong</font>

919
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,310
floor so like here we go you know put in

920
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,720
your password right let's look at the

921
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:09,580
let's go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look at the lift net</font>

922
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,130
user manual for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the default passwords</font>

923
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:14,080
right this is every lift net install

924
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:16,840
unless you use the default administrator

925
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,540
controls to change the default user

926
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,610
passwords and hopefully like change your

927
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:24,310
administrator creds to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you think the</font>

928
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:27,520
average elevator texts are doing that no

929
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:29,620
they're really not MCE another huge

930
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,940
supplier of elevator parts this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is MCE</font>

931
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,199
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> jen and this is one of their</font>

932
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,690
controller systems this is in their

933
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,850
manual they say hey if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have an MC e</font>

934
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:39,310
system you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> your remote support be</font>

935
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:41,649
sure to create a user on your router and

936
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:43,450
for remote access call it MCE support

937
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:45,250
and be sure to set the password to MC e

938
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:47,320
support while you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> at it go ahead and</font>

939
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:49,720
set the router password to MC e support

940
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,550
just set everything to MC e support so

941
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,660
that we can always<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in you know</font>

942
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:54,430
whenever we need to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your</font>

943
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,200
elevator for like that's in the manual

944
00:32:54,430 --> 00:33:00,280
that's what they're telling customers to

945
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:02,050
do yeah you get that from vendors all

946
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,330
the time right how about from like your

947
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:06,220
government like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the government itself</font>

948
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:08,020
them the regulatory bodies the elevator

949
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:11,170
industry in working with the government

950
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:14,080
developed something called the fe ok one

951
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:16,960
the fe<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok one was designed to be like</font>

952
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,970
the supreme<font color="#E5E5E5"> godfather fire key because</font>

953
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,100
again every brand a fixture kind of had

954
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:23,620
their own fire keys you know Otis<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

955
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,570
UTF and innovation was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the x5 15 and on</font>

956
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:27,729
down the line so they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's too</font>

957
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:29,470
many keys as if there's like a big

958
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:30,820
problem with this like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you show</font>

959
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:32,500
up at the job site you get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

960
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,820
if a fire truck is driving<font color="#E5E5E5"> around town</font>

961
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,110
and there's this building that building

962
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other building they want one key</font>

963
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:40,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok I get it feo k 1 and if it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

964
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:42,550
be this powerful key shall only be

965
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:45,280
possessed it says in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the code my</font>

966
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:47,230
elevator personnel responders etc no one

967
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,970
else should have this key so like any

968
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,550
good government operation in bureaucracy

969
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:53,290
they put the direct bidding code in the

970
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:55,210
freaking code when they put like that's

971
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:57,539
in the published code document been

972
00:33:55,210 --> 00:34:00,210
there since 2007

973
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:02,309
yes up here you use the fe<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay one on a</font>

974
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,899
ton of your systems if you see a tubular

975
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:05,220
key in an elevator like you got some

976
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:07,859
elevators in this country right there's

977
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,990
some big ones it's probably feo que one

978
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:11,069
if you're not sure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

percent chance it all the ones that I've

981
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:19,710
allegedly heard somebody test totally

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're feo que one but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just bear in mind</font>

983
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:24,449
it's again it's all naked on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the inside</font>

984
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:26,280
to right so the car panel you're just

985
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:28,980
you know you're just clicking dry

986
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,139
contacts together if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> interact</font>

987
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:33,449
with the rear side of that panel which

988
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:35,010
no one should ever do including whoever

989
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:37,379
this person which is totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> not me in</font>

this video should ever do<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're</font>

994
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:46,799
you shouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> touching but let's say</font>

995
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a situation like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this where the</font>

push those two contacts together now

1008
00:35:10,589 --> 00:35:15,210
independent service mode is enabled now

1009
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,669
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead and register and latch</font>

1010
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:18,839
a call on two floor 12 and because

1012
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:22,099
manually like drive the door shut or

1013
00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:24,710
open and whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do</font>

1014
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:27,809
completely janky and hokey right

1015
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:29,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely valid on a pen test you want</font>

1016
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:31,680
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere you don't want to be in</font>

1017
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,270
a building why look for stairwells that

1018
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,040
are unlocked or weird back like I've

1019
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,210
seen up the fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> exits somebody once</font>

1020
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,680
said to me I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like yeah I'm gonna</font>

1021
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:39,510
look for the elevators the first thing I

1022
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,700
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for because half the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

1023
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:43,829
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take me where I want to go</font>

1024
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,919
and I don't even<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use my legs all</font>

1025
00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:48,450
that much so there we are now we're just

1026
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know reconnecting everything back up</font>

1027
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:53,279
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely what we do is pen</font>

1028
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,500
testers and buildings inside of a target

1029
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,750
facility if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can find an elevator I can</font>

1030
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,369
usually leverage that elevator how do we

1031
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,900
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it most of the time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's way cleaner</font>

1032
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:03,180
than that ugly video most of the time

1033
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,920
it's you know key switches if we give

1034
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,450
the keys which most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the time we can</font>

1035
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,700
find the keys correctly because they're

1036
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:11,098
not change their default keys we can do

1037
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:13,589
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this here is an example tar</font>

1038
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:15,749
yep where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use fire service the front</font>

1039
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:17,549
of the building had a security lobby it

1040
00:36:15,749 --> 00:36:19,649
had a guard it had you know please sign

1041
00:36:17,549 --> 00:36:21,180
in are you on the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we thought we</font>

1042
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,680
might be able to bluff by them if you

1043
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,078
ever seen a good social engineering talk

1044
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,279
like good stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> right we said all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

1045
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,660
well they seem to be we're looking at

1046
00:36:26,279 --> 00:36:28,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">him through the lobby like glass for</font>

1047
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,729
like yeah they're looking pretty tight

1048
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:31,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">in there I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if we can just</font>

1049
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:34,319
breeze our way in let's walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> around the</font>

1050
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:35,640
building a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit around the back of</font>

1051
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:37,109
the building though there was an

1052
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,180
entrance it was on the parking<font color="#E5E5E5"> deck</font>

1053
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:40,859
which already they thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> no one could</font>

1054
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,019
get to because you needed a badge for

1055
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:45,720
the company to get the gate arm to like

1056
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:47,368
let you up the ramp yeah we walked up

1057
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,390
the ramp completely blew the clients

1058
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:52,559
mind they're like how did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get to</font>

1059
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:55,618
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> backdoor I was like I I have legs I</font>

1060
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:57,839
went up the ramp I walked up the ramp so

1061
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:59,279
from the back parking deck we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1062
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,009
the back door<font color="#E5E5E5"> which you'll see was like</font>

1063
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:03,539
locked but it wasn't like locked and

1064
00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:05,400
then there was an elevator and this

1065
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:07,440
elevator we could call it at the lobby

1066
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,619
but we couldn't go anywhere because we

1067
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,089
needed a badge or not and as you'll see

1068
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:14,670
we shot a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of footage and the</font>

1069
00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:16,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">client was so effing stunned that they</font>

1070
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:18,420
pulled security camera footage they said

1071
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,979
you didn't there's I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can't</font>

1073
00:37:19,979 --> 00:37:23,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the building a different way pull</font>

1074
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,960
that footage they'll order the client

1075
00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:26,999
thought we were lying here's here's some

1076
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,110
footage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us so we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the back</font>

1077
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:30,209

1080
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:41,130
now we can call you and now things are

1081
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,540
going to happen very quickly with

1082
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:48,350
multiple sets of communities that are

1083
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:51,270
kind of out of spec on day one place too

1084
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:53,009
now that elevator jewel is Rick this

1085
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:56,160

1088
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,529
whatever floor we want to go to

1089
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:09,390

1090
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,510
doors open<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hop out on whatever</font>

1091
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,859

1092
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,590
building is such that once you were

up here yes so Renner does point out

1234
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:34,240
that because the standard never

1235
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:36,589
specified clockwise or counterclockwise

1236
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,870
people have sometimes mate like some

1237
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:40,370
injury switches have made them wrong so

1238
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:41,960
technically it's supposed to be cut

1239
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:43,609
clockwise that is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard for all</font>

tubular keys if you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

1243
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:51,140
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them but the idea that you can</font>

1244
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:53,089
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this key for very little money</font>

1245
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:55,339
and do everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking about</font>

1246
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:58,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">very easily that's kind of creepy in my</font>

1247
00:43:55,340 --> 00:44:00,380
mind way creepier especially when<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mom</font>

1248
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:03,170
so this presentation is that hoistway

1249
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:05,150
stuff though right we had another job<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1250
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:07,370
had a medical<font color="#CCCCCC"> facility where we could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1251
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,990
on a low floor we were like on two or

1252
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:10,490
three and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to get up to the</font>

1253
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:12,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">fourth floor which had this radiation</font>

1254
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:14,240
lab and all the drug storage and stuff

1255
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,680
and we said well we can't seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move</font>

1256
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,299
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the building easily and it was an</font>

1257
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,830
older elevator it hadn't been<font color="#E5E5E5"> modernized</font>

1258
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,480
with fire you know fire mode that we

1259
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:22,640
could access which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not always</font>

1260
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,980
required in some parts of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US we</font>

1261
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:28,480
could use the hoistway though how did we

1262
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,480
use the hoistway well we did this

1263
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,890
completely out of spec this is not how

1264
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:37,109
you're supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do us we let the cab</font>

1265
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:39,480
kind of drip drop down let it rafal

1266
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:40,980
itself to the lobby checking this is

1267
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,710
with a drop key this is what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get</font>

1268
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,940
in that other little black box you saw

1269
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:47,309
look the elevators<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop down a little</font>

1270
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,410
bit to the almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the next floor pop</font>

1271
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:52,589
the hoistway door we should stop to the

1272
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:55,348
worse the older we can then get on the

1273
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:57,690
car top and I said car top has run

1274
00:44:55,349 --> 00:45:00,270
controls right so here's all of us

1275
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:04,460
getting in on one floor and we're going

1276
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:04,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just ride the car top up the hoistway</font>

1277
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:10,589
which you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not supposed to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

1278
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,420
pop open when you're like in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hall</font>

1279
00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:14,578

took<font color="#E5E5E5"> three are like this is my spare</font>

1338
00:47:55,790 --> 00:48:00,480
there was an elevator accident that was

1339
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:02,430
investigated by Howard and his team and

1340
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,590
what you're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is a clip from a</font>

1341
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:06,029
video like you'll see when an elevator

1342
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,170
was jumpered incorrectly when the

1343
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:09,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">safeties were not interlocked</font>

1344
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:11,640
incorrectly the elevator was running

1345
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:14,879
without the door being fully closed yet

1346
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:17,430
and this ultimately whoop that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ain't no</font>

1347
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,780
good and that caused a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> grievous</font>

1348
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:22,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">injury thank God it was in a hospital</font>

phone freak hackers there's phones in a

1359
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:45,450
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of elevators usually by code these</font>

1360
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,500
phones have regular phone lines pulled

1361
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:48,509
through the motor room through the

1362
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:51,000
traveling cable into the elevator car if

1363
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:53,849
you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that phone line there's a</font>

lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do like we always travel</font>

1367
00:48:56,310 --> 00:49:00,299
big little little handset like the the

1368
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,560
tiny this little like tiny it's like

1369
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,180
it's a phone that fits in the palm of

1370
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,070
your hand keep one of these around

the building if you call the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone</font>

1375
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:14,040
itself like if you can figure out the

1376
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:15,349
elevator phone number which maybe it's

1377
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:17,580
just written inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the panel like this</font>

1378
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:19,230
you can the phones are usually

1379
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:21,240
configured to automatically pick up

1380
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:23,640
silently on one ring then you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1381
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,839
the call with the elevator now

1382
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,240
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do with this information</font>

1383
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:29,190
well you could be mischievous and be

1384
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,080
like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching you I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the elevator I</font>

1385
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:32,700

1386
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:36,029
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think they're crazy I guess</font>

1387
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:37,649
that's fun in its own right or you could

1388
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:41,130
just call up an elevator<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not say</font>

1389
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:43,950
anything at all<font color="#CCCCCC"> just listen people use</font>

1390
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:45,030
elevators like refuge secluded spaces

1391
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:47,339
where they have very private

1392
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:48,840
conversations and in very big cities

1393
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:51,470
when government officials are in town

1394
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:53,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">for like you know g8 summits and stuff</font>

1395
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:55,859
you are not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be too surprised I</font>

1396
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:57,930
bet if I tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the phone company</font>

1397
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:59,340
has specialists come in and they're like

1401
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:08,040
what's happened trace that call like

1402
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:09,629
there are people who will try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to listen</font>

1403

to elevator calls and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

1404
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:13,830
elevator phones there are sometimes just

1405
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:15,450
intercoms in the elevator again usually

1406
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:17,580
based around the machine room in the

1407
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:18,990
machine room to turn that elevator in a

1408

movement or for having private

1412

conversations really quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> just on the</font>

00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:43,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">their maintenance like this is a this is</font>

1420
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,960
a maintenance control program this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

1421
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:47,610
MCP just<font color="#E5E5E5"> freaking blank and it's not</font>

1422
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this is a default one that came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

1423
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:51,600
like this was an accident site and

1424
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,190
Howard and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guys showed up like wow</font>

1425
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,600
you guys even<font color="#E5E5E5"> fake it you didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fill</font>

1426
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:56,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything out at all you just you had no</font>

1427
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,770
maintenance for years okay that sounds

1428
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,990
good guys they're all kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weird</font>

1429
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:02,430
hacks in the industry they once looked

1430
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:03,810
at these circuit breakers for one

1431
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:05,040
elevator<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was you know having some</font>

1432
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:08,580
problems they flipped open the panel

1433
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:10,740
those aren't fuses those are just busbar

1434
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:12,180
they're just there's bar connected like

1435
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,890
yeah we kept blowin fuses we don't know

1436
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:15,450
what to do so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like that was your</font>

1437
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:17,790
solution like yeah well kept running

1438
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:19,859
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff that</font>

1439
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:21,570
elevator<font color="#CCCCCC"> texts will sometimes do to get</font>

1440
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:23,880
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the elevators down everyone</font>

1441
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:25,650
is hopping mad everyone's saying fix it

1442
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,780
now fix it fix it fix it fix it you get

1443
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:29,730
tired<font color="#E5E5E5"> of going out there elevator text</font>

1444
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:32,550
will do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this look at the</font>

1445
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:36,750
second fuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the left see anything</font>

1446
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:38,460
odd about it is a little bit

1447
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:41,940
here a little bit of wire wrapped around

1448
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:44,250
that fuse it's taking just enough of the

1449
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:46,230
resistance load off that fuse to prevent

1450
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:49,680
it from blowing and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally what</font>

1451
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:51,540
they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> old-style</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> relay logic systems</font>

1452
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,660
where there's contacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> clacking on and</font>

1453
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:57,690
off this is carbon dust blowing all over

1454
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:59,580
the inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a you know controller box</font>

1455
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:01,290
which is conductive because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1456
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:03,000
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want inside among all your contacts</font>

1457
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:05,670
right that's just great conditions<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1458
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,920
they were on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one job and they were like</font>

1459
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:09,900
why are<font color="#CCCCCC"> there so many oil pads and like</font>

1460
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,150
bags of oil dry in the corner of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1461
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:14,190
hydraulic motor room so they looked at

1462
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:16,020
the tank they popped open the controller

1463
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:18,960
you know the pump system there was like

1464
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:21,450
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dishpan oil pad saturated there's so</font>

1465
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,700
much oil spewing out of this thing the

1466
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:26,160
hydro fluid<font color="#E5E5E5"> was soaking the test tag</font>

1467
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:27,660
which was illegible and they're like how

1468
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,540
long has this been like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

1469
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:32,310
building owner was like mmm and yet it

1470
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,990
falls on to that building owner it falls

1471
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:36,630
on to plant ops and maintenance if

1472
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:38,370
there's an incident this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1473
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:39,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">that could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on and if most</font>

1474
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:41,700
people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have keys to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their own</font>

1475
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:43,680
motor room most of the time you can't

1476
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,910
easily get into your motor room that's

1477
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,220
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> your elevator you know</font>

contractor is doing stick<font color="#CCCCCC"> your head in</font>

1479
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:50,520
there once in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while ask what's going</font>

1480

on find out if<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's any kind of</font>

conflicts of interest or collusion going

1482
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:57,330
on there are situations where inspection

1483
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:58,830
says this needs to be replaced but does

1484
00:52:57,330 --> 00:53:01,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">it need to be replaced like this is a</font>

test tag this was an inspection on an

1486
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:07,350
otis elevator system and you can see the

<font color="#E5E5E5">inspection was done by otis like unless</font>

was on where they kept tree roping the

cables tens of thousands<font color="#CCCCCC"> of dollars</font>

1493
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:22,080
they're getting pretty tired cables

1494
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:23,730
going bad we got to restring it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Howard</font>

1495
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,310
crawled into a maintenance space found

00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:35,910
is the kind of I'm not saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

common elevator<font color="#CCCCCC"> industry's no more</font>

interest in your elevator systems this

1506
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:47,090
can happen in the

1507
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,950
motor generator like ripped off the one

1508
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,450
of its you know install plates that was

1509
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:02,109
a final acceptance test for final

1510
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:03,279
readiness it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not ready but more than</font>

that like you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1512
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,660
main stick right security<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and follow</font>

1513
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,040
your building procedures badge people in

1514
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,970
and out we've breezed into buildings

1515
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">just say oh we're here for your</font>

1516
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:13,569
semiannual<font color="#E5E5E5"> were the elevator folk you</font>

1517
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:15,490
know people<font color="#CCCCCC"> just oh yeah I guess so you</font>

1518
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:19,180
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> the keys or something like oh thank</font>

1519
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:21,459
you yes if your security guard is an

1520
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:23,200
elevator you need to fire that security

1521
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:25,420
guard it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not doing what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

doing and when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> say oh what's the</font>

1523
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:29,740
worst that can happen like this is an

1524
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:31,540
elevator security system this is you

1525
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:33,310
need a badge and it's a biometric and

1526
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:36,480
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gets three factor</font>

1527
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:39,369
authentication why this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in an airport</font>

1528
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,800
but what does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is fire</font>

1529
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:44,200
service mode and that jewel is lit this

1530
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:46,089
is us<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to drive an elevator from the</font>

1533
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:52,720
airport now you can do that on just a

1534
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:55,810
test and simulate what could happen or

1535
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:58,029
somebody can<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy a four dollar feo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> que</font>

from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the output</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of open areas own very</font>

1538
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:04,240
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the more you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know about</font>

elevators and elevator controls and

1540
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,359
elevator key boxes you're going to start

1541
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,800
seeing them places that you maybe

1542
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:10,930
weren't noticing them before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope and</font>

1543
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,130
start thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about them and start</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking what this means for your</font>
