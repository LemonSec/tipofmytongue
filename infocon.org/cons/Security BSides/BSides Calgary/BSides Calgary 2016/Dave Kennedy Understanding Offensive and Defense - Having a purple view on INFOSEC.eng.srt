1
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:09,210
and something would blow up on the set

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,530
to a kitten David go okay what is that

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,289
okay hang on doesn't it

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:16,750
okay do another git pull and we had two

5
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:19,210
patches for the set toolkit while he's

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:22,720
teaching the class and you're watching

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:26,680
this guy type and you go on this is just

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,380
surreal but without further this is Dave

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,570
Kennedy and he was telling me yeah I

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,949
wrote some more code on the plane in so

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,789
this could be another one of the hosts

12
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:37,320

17
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,370
Jackie Chris hang every pointing Jack

00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:54,280
and Chris over there hey hey hey try to

19
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,800
sneak in back there I want to say this

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,000
is my first time in Calgary and and what

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,349
I expected is you know I don't know if

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,329
you know the custom wars that are going

23
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,800
on between the United States and Canada

24
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:04,449
but normally when you go in you get like

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,640
frisked then it's a vice-versa for you

26
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:08,200
folks so came in here and everybody was

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,329
super nice and friendly wearing cowboy

28
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,469
hats and was the exact opposite of what

29
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:13,419
I thought it was going to be so it's

30
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:14,399
pretty amazing but I want to thank you

31
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,600
everybody I flew in this morning

32
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:18,159
literally flew in from Cleveland is

33
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,538
about a five-hour trip and then I as

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,039
soon as I get done speaking here I'm

35
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:22,359
flying all the way back to Cleveland

36
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,819
Ohio so a really quick trip

37
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:26,829
unfortunately just a quick intro to

38
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:29,799
myself I'm one of the founders of Derby

39

to be a noon eastern time but we'll see

50
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:52,568
how that goes

51
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:58,538
whatever whatever that is Eastern Time

52
00:01:52,569 --> 00:02:01,029
I'm from engineer toolkit and I run two

53
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:03,669
companies trusted second binary defense

54
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:05,709
which you know is really relevant to

55
00:02:03,669 --> 00:02:07,270
this talk right here because when I

56
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,340
first got into the industry I was all

57
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,530
about breaking stuff and breaking stuff

58
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,300
was my entire life and that was you know

59
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,890
what I knew and that's all I knew and

60
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,660
you know getting out of the military

61
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,929
where all I did was break stuff and

62
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,390
getting

63
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,969
into consulting doing the same thing of

64
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,078
breaking stuff you know I went from that

65
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:25,959
to actually running an organization

66
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:27,849
running a fortune 1000 company where you

67
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:29,590
know I had a team of about 55 people or

68
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:31,869
so and trying to run the security

69
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,930
program and now is on defense and what I

70
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,639
realized was I had no idea what defense

71
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,079
really meant I had no idea really what

72
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,370
offense really meant or really what my

73
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:41,590
purpose was I was just a consultant

74
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,540
going and blow things up and then I

75
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,639
would go and leave a good example of

76
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,548
that is I remember hiring Chris from La

77
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:50,739
res to come in and break into the

78
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:52,329
Diebold at the time and it totally

79
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:53,349
destroyed us and they went and got

80
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:55,810
access to everything that we needed

81
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:57,760
access to they broken physically got

82
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,049
into all of our physical access and so

83
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,399
it was a good eye opener for me I was

84
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:01,750
actually funny I think the reason why I

85
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,340
started trusted sack and they're

86
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,359
actually the main reason why interests

87
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,819
are trusts I kinda think many people

88
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:08,169
know this is that Chris broke in and

89
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:11,560
found an Excel document that had

90
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:13,180
everyone's salaries and so of course

91
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,139
Chris looks up my salary is like dude

92
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,099
you should go and sell your only think

93
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:19,269
you can make a lot more money so so I

94
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:23,879
quit like I'm two months later

95
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:25,780
afterwards oh that's good sorry sorry

96
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,530
thank you Chris thank you for that

97
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,239
appreciate that

98
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,449
but you know when I left when I left

99
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,310
evil my goal was to start a company and

100
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:34,750
Trust the stack that understands not

101
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,040
only offense and defense but also

102
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,720
eventually get to the point to where I'm

103
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,189
at binary defense which is both on the

104
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,889
defense as well as trust it's like the

105
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:46,000
offense so trusted SEC is a consulting

106
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:47,530
company on the offense and BDS is a MSSP

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
type company on the defense you know

108
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,049
looking at what's actually happening out

109
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,400
there in those different types of

110
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:53,019
techniques so I get a lot of different

111
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,629
perspectives and I get to see a lot of

112
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:57,189
things that happen out there and this is

113
00:03:55,629 --> 00:04:00,129
why this talk is so important on the

114
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:01,870
offensive defense and so what I'm gonna

115
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:04,149
do is is start a little bit with just a

116
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,129
broad statement that if you look at

117
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,019
what's happening today and what we're

118
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:09,548
experiencing in this industry is we're

119
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:11,530
experiencing a very accelerated growth

120
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,819
we have a lot of folks coming into this

121
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,560
industry because it is a very hot

122
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,790
industry we have technology all over the

123
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,370
place we have new startups we have

124
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,719
programmers that are you know BC funds

125
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,789
that are they're throwing money at this

126
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,289
industry to try to make it into

127
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:24,789
something that they want it to be and

128
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:26,740
it's really interesting to see because

129
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:28,840
we still continue to see breeches and

130
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,520
most organizations don't

131
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,750
take the time to look at what those

132
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,460
breaches are how they're actually

133
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,990
happening and why they're actually

134
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,130
happening and it's interesting cuz it's

135
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,270
the same stuff that I've been talking

136
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,139
about and that Chris has been talking

137
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,909
about that everybody has an issue he's

138
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,050
been talking about for ten years it's

139
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,430
the same techniques it's the same

140
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,930
methods is the same way that we're

141
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,550
breaking into all these organizations

142
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,380
but yet we're still failing at how we

143
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,780
actually go and combat these types of

144
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,520
threats and so my talk today is looking

145
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,380
at both what we do for an offensive

146
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,698
perspective but really where we need to

147
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,290
move from a defense side and

148
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,270
understanding one another because it's

149
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,800
no longer and we're no longer in an

150
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,299
industry where you could just do defense

151
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,070
we're no longer an industry where you

152
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,320
can just do offense we have to do both

153
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,580
we have to understand what methods there

154
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,680
are out that these attackers are

155
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,599
leveraging and how to ultimately defend

156
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,490
against those I find that when I sit

157
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,530
with somebody that is on the defense I

158
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,330
learned so much more I learn new ways of

159
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,219
breaking into stuff I get better by

160
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,020
learning defense same thing for offense

161
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,250
if I have some folks sitting with me

162
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,810
that are actually on the defense looking

163
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,979
or I'm doing like oh that's how you do

164
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,750
that that's what that means when I'm

165
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:27,639
over here in doing this or if I'm

166
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,380
sitting with the developer during a red

167
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,360
team exercise or a purple team exercise

168
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:35,620
you know they learn from those type of

169
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,860
of endeavors and so what this not

170
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,210
letting it through what this what this

171
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,380
talk is really about is looking at that

172
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,510
but what I want to first start off with

173
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,190
is is when we look at the industry I

174
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,139
remember when I first started I started

175
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,550
off with you know hey what's this risk

176
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,169
crap and what's likelihood and

177
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,030
probability and impact and all these

178
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:53,229
other things that make up this I just

179
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,539
like to break into stuff and smash

180
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:57,219
things and what I realized from a

181
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:59,530
defensive perspective is that you have

182
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,880
to understand what your highest

183
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,020
likelihood and what your highest impact

184
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,310
what your highest risk is going to be

185
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,620
within your organization and that's

186
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,820
extremely important because you know we

187
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,169
have a million risks within

188
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,490
organizations that we have to defend

189
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:11,440
against on a daily basis we have

190
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,510
millions of vulnerabilities I mean a

191
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,250
thing called ions ask-an-expert where

192
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,389
you get phone calls with folks that are

193
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,800
asking questions and the biggest

194
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:19,870
question is how do I know if my vulnera

195
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,340
management program is working you know

196
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,599
we have five million vulnerabilities

197
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,799
there criticals and highs and their

198
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:25,450
mediums and lows and I don't know how to

199
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,340
prioritize those I don't know which ones

200
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,719
are most important to me and that's a

201
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,190
great question how do you know if your

202
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,450
program is effective when you have five

203
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,710
million risks that are out there are

204
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,719
vulnerabilities that can equate to a

205
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,030
risk and that's a great question because

206
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,740
on the offense we look at things that we

207
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,869
can actively go after during a very

208
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,040
specific period of time on the defense

209
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,350
we have this whole world

210
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,640
to deal with called business we have

211
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,110
people they were to deal with we have

212
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,159
fires there to put out and we have

213
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,410
things that we have to do on a regular

214
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,030
basis that take us away from being more

215
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,580
proactive and even understanding what

216
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,080
offense means and so we did a survey

217
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,909
based on a number of breach instance we

218
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,680
have this is from our IR Incident

219
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,990
Response Teams and Trust is like a

220
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,430
binary defense and looking at the

221
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,350
analysis of those different types of

222
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,480
breaches 82% came from endpoint

223
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,000
compromises originally which is no shock

224
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,470
to anybody out here right 82% a large

225
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,800
percentage our highest probability in

226
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:16,330
the highest risk came from the endpoints

227
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,950
14% came from perimeter compromises so

228
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,020
the traditional methods of attacking

229
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:21,789
through web applications most of time

230
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,859
they become CMS's but most of tender

231
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,300
their CMS's like WordPress or you know

232
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,910
those types of things that our initial

233
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,440
entry vectors into an organization four

234
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,300
percent were mostly password we users

235
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,500
from other sites site gets compromised

236
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,120
their third party gets compromised in

237
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,470
that pastures the same on the other

238
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,720
organization that was typically out

239
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,570
there so we can see here that our two

240
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,890
highest probability areas of attack are

241
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,960
gonna be our employees which are number

242
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,820
one and that's why you know I have a

243
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,049
friend that pinged me today and he's

244
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,550
like hey do you ever think that you're

245
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:53,740
gonna be out of a job because of how

246
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:55,080
secure Windows 10 is funny story about

247
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,030
Windows 10 okay

248
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,820
when Windows 10 came out and I go

249
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:04,030
through these phases as a tester right

250
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:06,520
you know I look at like when Server 2008

251
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,530
came out and you know they they you know

252
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,700
increased our tepees version and you

253
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,809
know used encryption they spent a lot on

254
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,610
security and I started getting a little

255
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,810
nervous like hey they starting to figure

256
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,280
out how we're doing things and they're

257
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,050
gonna start actually stopping us and

258
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,090
what I realized is is that every

259
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,670
iteration it gets you know

260
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:23,219
instrumentally more complex about how

261
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,270
they're actually doing things in it

262
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,890
increases more and more attack exposures

263
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,020
that out there so what was funny with

264
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,969
Windows 10 this is a great story when I

265
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,169
when Windows 10 first got released

266
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,270
you know touting that they had spent

267
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,098
like 1 billion dollars on security and

268
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,390
all of these other things right and so

269
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,680
I'm like oh well maybe they're stopping

270
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,689
things like set there are things like

271
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,829
that you know or Metasploit or you know

272
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,110
other things that I would typically do

273
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,700
so I go and I download a copy of Windows

274
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,740
10 you know fully patched it up see

275
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,990
what's going on and I go when I launch

276
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,370
set and I go and I launched the Java

277
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,690
applet attack and there go there comes

278
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,340
my shell and everything works just as

279
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,800
expected I didn't make any changes or

280
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,910
anything

281
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,620
like well maybe they're stopping other

282
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,569
things like hey maybe some sort of you

283
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,519
know PE inspection or dynamic analysis

284
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,709
of executables nothing like that at all

285
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,060
so you know what I look at that and I

286
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,050
say you know when you look at the

287
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,399
different securities that are happening

288
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,540
well there might be some good security

289
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:11,000
things that are happening in some of

290
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,500
these these software's the humans are

291
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,180
always going to be our largest and

292
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,399
biggest weakness that we can't fix

293
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,050
because it's very much cultural and so

294
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,269
I'll talk to him about that I want to

295
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:22,519
show you a video that I did on CNN a

296
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:25,160
little bit ago where we did a live hack

297
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,120
on on a company that allowed us to do it

298
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,459
so we got permission from one of our

299
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,529
customers to do a social engineering

300
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:32,779
event for them and it worked out really

301
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:35,870
well but a funny story about this

302
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:37,130
specific case when you when you do

303
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,450
social engineering and guess an

304
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,339
individual especially over the phone

305
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,930
there's some things that you can do and

306
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:43,339
some things that you can't do to get

307
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,260
them to do what you want to you like for

308
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:47,060
example in this case I called the help

309
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,470
desk and if you go to the help desk you

310
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,029
say hey I need you I need you to reset

311
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,019
you know Bob's password well they're

312
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:53,540
gonna challenge you for a specific

313
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:54,740
question right but if I just say hey I

314
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,390
can't get to this website this website

315
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,350
is not working good good chance you're

316
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,819
not going to get challenged or

317
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,110
questioned about your employee ID or who

318
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,860
you are or anything like this there's

319
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,570
certain things that you can do in the

320
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,570
confines of that but a funny story about

321
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:11,360
this one the the producer wanted me to

322
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:12,649
actually hack into her her bosses her

323
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,180
boss that was travelling basically

324
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:15,589
Internationa the time and so the boss

325
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,939
was in France and so I did a little bit

326
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:19,220
of reconnaissance on him just ahead of

327
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,360
time and saw they was in Paris and I

328
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,370
spoofed my phone number

329
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,260
coming from chase fraud services saying

330
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,279
hey you know just you know and I called

331
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,350
him up and I you know it's call him Bob

332
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,850
and I said hey Bob I just want to see

333
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,380
you know we're seeing some some weird

334
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,360
activity are you currently traveling in

335
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,740
Paris right now and what happens when

336
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,149
you when you already know something

337
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,010
about somebody is they have a little

338
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:38,449
sense of comfort right they're like hey

339
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,980
you know this is normal this is okay

340
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:42,349
this is you know who this person says

341
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,399
they are and he's like yep I'm traveling

342
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,020
a pair of something's fine like okay

343
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,100
that's great can you uh you know confirm

344
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,630
a couple things for me first you know

345
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,670
when are you coming back from Paris and

346
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,949
Bob's like oh I'm coming back you know

347
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,180
the you know the this Friday or whatever

348
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:54,469
I'm see you know you don't to worry

349
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,670
about any fraudulent transactions like

350
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,199
okay that's great well I just need to go

351
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,959
over a couple of transactions for you

352
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:02,719
really quick he's like okay which ones

353
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:04,760
are they and so in this specific type of

354
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,709
technique there's a few type of things

355
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,060
that you can do one is is the person is

356
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:09,560
not exactly sure whether

357
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,969
your chaste fraud services or not or

358
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,109
they might be a little cautious about

359
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,220
giving you things like their social

360
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,960
security number which is what she wanted

361
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,830
me to get from him right and so if I

362
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,150
want to get after his social security

363
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:19,430
number I have to really make him

364
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,630
uncomfortable or without a shadow of a

365
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,650
doubt prove Who I am because it's

366
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,510
personal to you and I don't even know

367
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,470
this turnout but people like when

368
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,360
they're giving up company information

369
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:29,660
have no problems giving up company

370
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,010
information at all but as soon as you

371
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,990
start talking about sin as personal so

372
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,010
then they get pissed right like Social

373
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,200
Security numbers or something that they

374
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,340
don't need and the reason I was able to

375
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,830
find out that there were cases if you

376
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,480
actually go to you do some research on

377
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,700
Turner their main corporate Cardoz is

378
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,820
chase so I was able to figure out you

379
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,740
know at least Li ba some of that initial

380
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,730
identification there but so when I when

381
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,230
I made the call to Bob and I started

382
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,220
saying this I'm like hey Bob I need you

383
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,600
to verify a couple these things and I

384
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,740
could tell he's in a public area there's

385
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,820
a lot of chatter going around and can

386
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,960
tell that Bob started in getting and

387
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,100
started to get a little bit annoyed that

388
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,320
he just wants to get this over with

389
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,430
right and so if I ask him for a social

390
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,140
now while he's being in North there's a

391
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,550
good chance and I won't get it so I

392
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,199
basically kind of knocked him off the

393
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,370
center a little bit I said well yes did

394
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,350
you spend five hundred seventy dollars

395
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,480
and I said I named a horrible dungeon

396
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,010
porn adult store you know in this area

397
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,680
and I started naming off some horrible

398
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:17,090
sites right and it caused them to get

399
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,140
really uneasy no no no no I didn't I

400
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,490
didn't purchase me and I'm like okay

401
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,780
well Bob that's fine you know it looks

402
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,430
like your card got compromised where I'm

403
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,839
traveling I'm like can you do me a favor

404
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,189
can you in order for me to get rid of

405
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,230
these I need you to repeat the names of

406
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,370
these stores in the amounts so that I

407
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,390
can remove them off your card so he's

408
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,950
saying all these horrible names in

409
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,949
public and he's totally uncomfortable

410
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,630
and so then I'm like okay well hey Bob

411
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:40,010
can you can you just give me I need to

412
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,330
close a couple things out here can you

413
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,290
give me your full social so I can close

414
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,060
this on your account he's like yeah

415
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,469
here's my social Spitz Adamic hey what's

416
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,760
your date of birth and then we started

417
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,100
laughing and then you know it was all

418
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,569
good on that but this interviews is part

419
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,770
of this and what we ended up doing in

420
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:58,040
the for the live solution denier event

421
00:12:51,770 --> 00:13:00,110
for Bob when I say the word hacker

422
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,510
some creepy dude in a basement well

423
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,460
that's a misconception what if I told

424
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:06,050
you there's a class of hackers who don't

425
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,090
just have

426
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,770
they have more social intelligence than

427
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,930
anyone you'll ever meet

428
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:14,120
David Kennedy is one of them he's what's

429
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:16,010
known as a social engineer a people

430
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,350
hacker his craft is to dupe you into

431
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:22,520
doing things and sharing information you

432
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:25,070
probably should some use it for illegal

433
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,689
activity and David's case companies Pam

434
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,880
to find out if employees are leaving the

435

company vulnerable pianist team show us

436

how it's done step one

437
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,190
spoof his number so it looks like he's

438
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,420
calling from inside the company and then

439
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:41,120
call tech support

440
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:42,829

452
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,820
given David full access to his computer

453
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,630

459
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:31,760
able to take take over this this guy's

460
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,599
computer within I would say like under 2

461
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,430
men under 2 minutes

462
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,990
yeah under t that was a fun one that's

463
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,099
how stupid easy it is right just got to

464
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,900
think like you know hey I'm in a

465
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,120
situation I'm a buying and don't do

466
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,579
things that come off nervous one of our

467
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,080
guys Larry whenever he does social

468
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,340
engineering like we don't let him

469
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,200
usually do social injuring much anymore

470
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,810
because his face gets beet red and you

471
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,640
can't lie and he comes on the phone gets

472
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,619
all nervous right and that's gonna cause

473
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,210
some flags but if you sound legitimate

474
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,520
and you're not doing anything crazy

475
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,570
that's gonna cause somebody to trigger

476
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,340
an alarm you're usually pretty fine

477
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,450
especially over the phone most people

478
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,310
don't expect you to be counting them

479
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,380
over the phone so usually it works

480
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:11,270
really well i'ma show you the attack

481
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,820
vector that I used in this specific one

482
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,620
and actually as I was on the airplane

483
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:17,960
flying here I found that Symantec the

484
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,680
Symantec and defender are getting a

485
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,620
little bit better

486
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:25,790
at PowerShell injection detection and so

487
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,930
the older version of set got snagged the

488
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,880
PowerShell injection technique got

489
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:30,020
snagged and so I started debugging on

490
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,710
the airplane while is here trying to

491
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,319
figure out what they're actually

492
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:36,740
flagging on there literally looking at

493
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,480
static variable names inside of the

494
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,240
Power Cell injection so all I did was

495
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,890
rewrite us so that their dynamic

496
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,160
variable names and it works just fine

497
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:48,310
so it's so stupid we're we're at today

498
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,110
right it's like hey we're gonna write a

499
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:54,050
signature off of a variable name and

500
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,430
that's malicious right whatever

501
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,479
so anyways once I figure that out took

502
00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:09,670
about three minutes to recode and so

503
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:11,990
I'll show you right now I don't remember

504
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,490
so this is the latest version I've said

505
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,290
this is seven now one but I'll put I'll

506
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,810
push an increment up it'll be like 7.1.1

507
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,610
or something like that but with this

508
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,069
latest version what's interesting is is

509
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,480
kind of how all the attacks have evolved

510
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:26,029
especially for social engineering java

511
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,459
was my you know area of choice because

512
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:30,410
everybody had it and in java stills okay

513
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:33,439
I still use job every so often I usually

514
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,699
fall back I'm either on Java or or some

515
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,130
other something else but was funny is uh

516
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,170
one of our guys at the office Justin was

517
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,240
like hey he's like I think we should

518
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:44,060
start using HTA's I'm like seriously

519
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,339
HTA's that's like 1995 you know cool

520
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,199
right and there's a he actually found a

521
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:51,290
book that he had and it was a book that

522
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,459
was like cool hacks from like 1999 or

523
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,079
something like that was like a big thick

524
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:55,880
book that was like rainbow-colored and

525
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,500
you need to open it up and it said

526
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,470
something like hey malicious h J's can

527
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,610
be used for compromising systems so I

528
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,160
started making fun of Justin a little

529
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:06,349
bit and we go on a social engineering

530
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,000
effort and we use the h GS as an attack

531
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:09,050
vector we had a fall backup Java applet

532
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,630
something there's no is is ever gonna

533
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,829
work we had like a 94% success ratio

534
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,420
with that right you know I was like

535
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,550
insane like we sent the three people two

536
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,600
of them you know snagged it so you know

537
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,109
it was something that was that was

538
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,688
really awesome

539
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:22,399
so my main method now for doing these or

540
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:23,569
HDA files because in most cases they

541
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,699
don't get snagged by most stuff out

542
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:27,379
there their dynamic in nature and

543
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:29,270
they're not as noisy as something like a

544
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,679
Java applet that you traditionally have

545
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,760
out there and especially if you do

546
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:33,200
things like signing them and think

547
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,790
like that it works out really well um

548
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,530
has a nice prompt it doesn't it looks

549
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,300
like is actually being signed by the

550
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:40,399
Microsoft Corporation so it's fantastic

551
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,740
so I use that now it's kind of my main

552
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,540
method for leveraging in this new

553
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,070
version by the way has a holy if you've

554
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,629
done a lot of Microsoft sequel

555
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,730
exploitation um has a whole new

556
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,080
different module for MS sequel

557
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:54,140
exploitation and actually use Matthew

558
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,720
grabbers method for let me go back a

559
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,890
second so if it doesn't happen if you go

560
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,820
to a system that doesn't have PowerShell

561
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,470
and some folks are actually getting

562
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,090
somewhat decent a blocking PowerShell

563
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,370
there's a number of ways of getting

564
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:07,820
files onto a system and executing them a

565
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:10,100
really cool way is if you take a PE file

566
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,750
executable and you basics D for encode

567
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,639
it and then you give it the begin

568
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,870
certificate put that base64 in between

569
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,460
and then you put end certificate and

570
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,959
then you use cert util it'll actually

571
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,110
convert that to a binary for you next to

572
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,980
Keita which is fantastic so so there's a

573
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,030
lot of different ways but that's been

574
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,830
rewritten into the latest version as

575
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,720
well but I'll gonna use the social

576
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,889
engineering attacks number two I'll do

577
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,840
the website attack factor number two

578
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,120
number two and then I'll use the HD

579
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:38,060
tackle method number eight and also

580
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:40,929
clone trust the sec is an example any my

581
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,929
IP address real quick

582
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,940
that's not what I wanted

583
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:02,990
almost got me how long sky Soyuz

584
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:05,210
Metasploit from a pelo but it doesn't

585
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,920
matter anything that's in this technique

586
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,410
by the way if you're not familiar with

587
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,760
what's gonna happen is it's gonna do

588
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:13,160
it's called PowerShell injection and

589
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,780
with PowerShell a lot of this is moving

590
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,130
off of traditional by our you know

591
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,720
viruses are moving off a traditional

592
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,760
executables although still like 90 some

593
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,290
percent of them are still executables

594
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,520
but what this is gonna do is again and

595
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,440
take Metasploit shellcode and directly

596
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,150
shove it into memory and execute without

597
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,710
touching disk and what's great about as

598
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,480
it circumvents execution restriction

599
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,590
policies because you can pass things

600
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,840
that are called the encoded command

601
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:36,050
parameters which is a talk I gave it

602
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,790
like DEFCON like 13 or 14 or something

603
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:40,220
like that I did a talk on PowerShell

604
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:42,889
when it originally came out and so

605
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,200
that's the old old shell from earlier

606
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:48,440
but um what I'll go and do is I'll go to

607
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,530
the website when I launch this is gonna

608
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,460
pick up an HT 8 now in edge and actually

609
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,550
I don't if you notice on that but

610
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,170
Windows 10 actually has both Internet

611
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,950
Explorer and edge on it as well which I

612
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,480
never knew about so if you actually

613
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,070
google or look for inner Explorer it's

614
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,430
in there as well but you can use edge or

615
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:07,570
Internet Explorer I don't use Microsoft

616
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:07,570
too much so I'm not exactly sure which

617
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:19,070
and what's this loads we go to the

618
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:21,980
website and it's gonna be a website that

619
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:23,330
I clone now what's interesting is the

620
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,060
way that I'll typically build these into

621
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:28,909
my attacks I think it's so slow didn't

622
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:30,040
load I put time delay in a real quick

623
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:33,230
there we go

624
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,550
so what's nice about this specific

625
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,130
attack I had a little bit of short time

626
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:38,060
Delaine here but as soon as it pops up

627
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,620
you could build these into your attacks

628
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,940
like hey we need to verify your computer

629
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,469
or we need to figure out what's going on

630
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,570
with your machine or anything you want

631
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:46,040
to notice here it's asking for internet

632
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:48,110
explorer security do you want the name

633
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,879
microsoft HTML application host

634
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:53,479
publisher microsoft windows do you want

635
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:58,510
to open this would you open that yeah

636
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,510
absolutely right i did twice

637
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,790
so as soon as he hit allow it goes in an

638
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,110
execute power shell on the back end and

639
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,790
it's not inside of a container so you

640
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:10,750
get full access to the machine once it

641
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:12,940
pops up so there it goes right there so

642
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,470
very easy method for compromise and

643
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,480
exploitation especially in the social

644
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,950
engineering side what's great is so

645
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,810
Windows Defender is actually getting a

646
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,210
little bit better Windows Defender with

647
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:24,790
Windows 10 they exposed a lot of

648
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,900
virtualization and sandboxing api's and

649
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,879
I think they're kind of going the route

650
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,250
of like micro micro virtualization and a

651
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,280
lot of their different ways that they

652
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,450
actually look at executables now in even

653
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,120
PowerShell as well and they're actually

654
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,710
exposing a lot of the power show ways of

655
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,149
identifying PowerShell injection as it's

656
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,920
happening so there are a lot of ways of

657
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,880
detecting these types of things so they

658
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,290
are getting a little bit better and more

659
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,030
creative on the ways that they're

660
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,440
actively looking for these but at the

661
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,180
same time you know every organization

662
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,700
that we go to typically stuffs

663
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,590
powershell open and everything else so

664
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,940
you will have that for quite a quite the

665
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:59,379
foreseeable future and so I'll push that

666
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,790
code up like I'm when I'm on the

667
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:06,430
airplane if they have Wi-Fi so if you

668
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:08,980
look at the this data I said from before

669
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:10,870
on the stats right 82% endpoint

670
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,550
compromises 14% perimeter compromises

671
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:14,080
our highest probability of getting

672
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,450
attacked or getting compromises through

673
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,639
our users right and in most cases that

674
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,050
is almost always our least area

675
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,520
visibility I mean we'll have like

676
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,169
something like semantics or McAfee on

677
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,820
there or something like that maybe it

678
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,880
goes into some sort of sin maybe a dozen

679
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,320
who knows but in most cases you know we

680
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,180
don't have the type of visibility need

681
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,280
to actually see what's happening on our

682
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,690
endpoints themselves and so if you look

683
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,160
at what we're actually spending our time

684
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,510
on or what we want to spend our time on

685
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,180
what we should be spending our time on

686
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:43,270
this is kind of a known entity this is a

687
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,770
study done by NY and they said you know

688
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,330
what the question was what threats or

689
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,970
challenges are the greatest concerns for

690
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:51,220
you and then the predominant number 157

691
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:53,230
percent of people said their number one

692
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,850
priority was sophisticated attacks

693
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,580
targeting at your organization okay

694
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:59,919
the second biggest one was phishing

695
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:02,139
social network exploits or other forms

696
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,730
of social engineering okay so where's

697
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,690
Hart we're concerned about targeted

698
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,040
attacks and we're concerned about

699
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,690
phishing or social engineering right

700
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,970
those are the two top concerns that we

701
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,610
have in this actual industry which is

702
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:14,120
interesting right

703
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:17,399
well we actually spend our time on

704
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,750
majority of it is security

705
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,030
vulnerabilities introduced by my own

706
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,020
application developments security

707
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:25,220
vulnerabilities introduced to the

708
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:27,300
purchase of off-the-shelf software and

709
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,440
phishing social network exploits or

710
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,210
other forms of social engineering

711
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,010
typically can monetize phishing schemes

712
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,420
that happen to hit your organization

713
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,790
like ransomware now and everything else

714
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:37,710
and so you look at this that our jobs

715
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,330
really deal with putting fires out on a

716
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,070
regular basis it's not necessarily

717
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:43,169
proactive security that we're typically

718
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,790
seeing out there it's really trying to

719
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,080
put out fires with an organization than

720
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:49,260
actually understanding what our risks

721
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,169
are now for me when we go into

722
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:54,090
organizations it's always like hey you

723
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,350
know Dave we don't understand what

724
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,730
you're doing it's like magic it's like

725
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,050
mystical that you can actually break in

726
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,370
these systems and understand and in most

727
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,919
cases it's usually like an exploit that

728
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:04,199
was like from like you know 2010 or even

729
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,700
older like Apache right Tomcat are still

730
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,370
out there JBoss all the things like that

731
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,380
we still find stupid things that really

732
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:12,479
should be patched or should be fixed in

733
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,070
early Kait in cases but the defense

734
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,410
doesn't really understand or know what

735
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:18,179
exactly is happening out there and so if

736
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,050
you look at that and that's a that's a

737
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:24,270
big issue we'll talk about that in a

738
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:27,060
second so in order for us to get better

739
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:28,710
as an industry it first starts with with

740
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,790
not focusing as much on the fires

741
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,250
although they're absolutely important

742
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:33,510
it's more so understanding that you have

743
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,380
to focus on the larger picture and

744
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,850
actually have a strategy around

745
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,840
understanding offense and defense to

746
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,669
actually build them and to show you a

747
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,350
little bit of our history of library

748
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,910
where we're at today and it's not all

749
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,889
all our fault and in fact we're doing a

750
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,660
lot of great things but the truth of the

751
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,760
matter is that we require a lot of work

752
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,080
right now and on most organizations to

753
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,970
get to where we'd need to be to even

754
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:55,649
handle what we're seeing today let alone

755
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:56,430
what's going to happen tomorrow you look

756
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:59,700
at some of the main methods of

757
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:01,410
exploitation executables by far 94

758
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,610
percentage of what we see typically out

759
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,500
there from infection rates are still

760
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:07,139
binary droppers that's slowly changing

761
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,130
the PowerShell bash now is being

762
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,020
integrated into Windows which is

763
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:12,330
fantastic I love that I love it I love

764
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,830
it love it honestly when I saw that

765
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,899
press release I did a happy dance and

766
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,820
then I celebrated with some bourbon so

767
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,470
it was fantastic

768
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:21,379
but that it's like they're handing us

769
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:25,130
new weapons for exploitation which is

770
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:26,419
it's great so understanding often today

771
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:28,759
is it could be a more important and I'd

772
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:30,350
like to reference the is anybody read

773
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:31,940
anybody read what the right up for the

774
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,559
hacking team or the guy that the hacking

775
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,570
team didn't write what was interesting

776
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:37,070
about that and I think I made a comment

777
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,539
Chris made a comment a few of us that

778
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,580
actually made the penetration testing

779
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:42,440
execution standard the guy literally

780
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,879
followed the penetration testing

781
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,740
execution standard to the team we need

782
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,029
destroyed hacking team like he went

783
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,470
through the reconnaissance in

784
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:50,690
intelligence gathering and threat

785
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:52,490
modeling and looking at what male areas

786
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:54,080
actually go after his vulnerability

787
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,580
analysis phase of actually finding a

788
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,559
flaw in the environment the exploitation

789
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,970
phase that one small hit he wasn't

790
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:00,980
running scanners anywhere to find things

791
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,360
you know he exfiltrated a day he moved

792
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,460
laterally in the environment to find

793
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,719
things this is how breaches happened

794
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:08,269
that's how they're happening today

795
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,950
how attackers get access is by going

796
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:11,299
into one system moving to others and

797
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,500
then moving from system system until

798
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:15,408
they get access to the data than you

799
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,389
need and I don't like to quote Verizon's

800
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:19,549
data breach report so much there's a lot

801
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:20,658
of ambiguity to a lot of it but one

802
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:23,029
thing that was really interesting that I

803
00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:25,039
found from that report is that if you

804
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:26,539
look at the time it took to actually

805
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,029
compromise an organization was usually

806
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:31,700
minutes the time to actually export raid

807
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:33,740
data was days so it took an attack or a

808
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,179
couple minutes to get in then it took an

809
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,740
attack or a couple days to find the type

810
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:38,240
of data they needed and then excellent

811
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,769
rate that out of the company so you

812
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,240
literally have days to figure this out

813
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:42,320
to actually find a breach before it

814
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,149
actually happens I mean you have to find

815
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,408
it the second it happens and to be

816
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:47,479
honest with you one machine becoming

817
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:48,769
compromised is relatively irrelevant to

818
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,389
your entire organization security

819
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:52,639
posture if you can catch it as it's

820
00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:54,139
happening it's but it's a very small

821
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:57,408
window of what we're actually seeing out

822
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:59,508
there and so if you look at foundational

823
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:00,950
principles of that that types of

824
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:01,519
techniques haven't changed from ten

825
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,600
years ago

826
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,500
it's the same method you know it's

827
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,299
what's interesting is the word

828
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,360
sophisticated in hackers the

829
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:10,100
sophisticated accurate hackers that term

830
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,559
is literally what we've been doing for

831
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,509
10 20 you know 30 years about

832
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,009
compromising an organization it just

833
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:18,350
means that you're targeted by somebody

834
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:19,759
that knows how to run an exploit or buy

835
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,899
an exploit kits or something like that

836
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:22,250
now you're sitting in a sophisticated

837
00:27:20,899 --> 00:27:24,469
room if you can code bash you're now a

838
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:29,330
sophisticated actor in this industry and

839
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:30,620
that's a big excuse for me the product

840
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:32,120
industry and this is just my personal

841
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,039
believe the product industry has set us

842
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,120
back 10 years and security because we

843
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:36,080
are now reliant

844
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,429
then I'm gonna show you a little bit of

845
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,070
history around where we came from an

846
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:42,020
InfoSec and this is my my opinion of

847
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:46,460
where we came from in this industry you

848
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:48,110
look at the 90s and you had basics hey

849
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,280
we need to architect our network cuz we

850
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,419
didn't have you know things like

851
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,220
firewalls and maybe they were just

852
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,570
starting to come out and you know hey we

853
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,010
need to do network segmentation we need

854
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,210
to split off these people you know sales

855
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,680
folks you know from a technology

856
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,820
perspective shouldn't you need to talk

857
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,870
to these folks and we shouldn't talk to

858
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:05,360
these folks and so we did a lot of

859
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:08,649
basics what the hell was that sound like

860
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,649
someone was ripping ones anyways better

861
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:13,160
so we had all these basic principles

862
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,470
that we built kind of what we thought

863
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:18,110
would be a good way of being able to

864
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:20,179
stop what we saw at that time but nobody

865
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:21,530
listened and so we tried at least slow

866
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:22,880
it down a little bit and say hey we need

867
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,139
to stop what you're doing here we need

868
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,970
to inspect what you're doing so that we

869
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,920
can make sure that it's secure and so

870
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,240
then InfoSec really became you know the

871
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,380
hey we're the ones that stopped the

872
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,170
organization from be able to implement

873
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:35,270
IT and so then we were just known as the

874
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,830
ones that cry wolf right or like hey

875
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:38,000
they're always saying it's gonna be bad

876
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:40,669
but we haven't seen it they're not

877
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,380
they're not bad and then we got PC on PC

878
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:44,240
I was like a god-sent for the security

879
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,160
industry because we're like hey don't

880
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,300
comply to PCI you're not gonna be able

881
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,440
to use credit cards and hackers gonna

882
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,210
break and steal your credit cards right

883
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,559
so again we were the folks that were

884
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,360
crying wolf right we're out there saying

885
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:56,000
hey PCI is what we have to adhere to we

886
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,699
have to do PCI PCI PCI well then the

887
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,500
awesome thing of target happened right

888
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:04,610
and see I did there yeah um but then it

889
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,960
was let's not be the next target we've

890
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,090
heard that play for the next you know a

891
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,360
few years and so again we're crying wolf

892
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:14,689
right and then one awesome magical thing

893
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,800
happened right well there's a whole

894
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,660
bunch of them a whole bunch of people

895
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,700
got nailed right and everybody started

896
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,260
freaking out everybody every business

897
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,610
because you know sorry it kind of

898
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,710
started with target a little bit the CEO

899
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:26,540
got let go and all these other folks and

900
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,800
you know all you know board of directors

901
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,690
now are getting super concerned with

902
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,580
cybersecurity and now cyber cyber cyber

903
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:33,440
cyber and also other stuff and China and

904
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:36,559
lost great stuff right and then the

905
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,690
InfoSec market went crazy people were

906
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,879
literally scared at what was going on in

907
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,980
this industry like what we have all of

908
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,270
these cyber weapons you know that can

909
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,970
literally take down our entire company

910
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:48,410
and shut us down

911
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,960
we have sophisticated attackers that

912
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:51,360
we're

913
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:55,470
in basements that can literally like

914
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:57,959
wipe us clean right and then we started

915
00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:00,030
getting things like words like apts and

916
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,940
sophisticated actors and hackers

917
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:04,620
everywhere and so it gave organizations

918
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:10,050
a way to say well we're not at fault

919
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:11,699
here because it was sophisticated when

920
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:15,080
literally they had like NetBIOS expose

921
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,590
on the internet right not our fault not

922
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,350
our fault

923
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:21,240
and then something awesome happened in

924
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:26,929
the security industry something amazing

925
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:29,370
right we got funding we got cash and

926
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:31,020
like hey I don't know what you need but

927
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,250
tell me what you need for money and I

928
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,410
will go and I will give it to you for

929
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:37,470
your for your budget right so our budget

930
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:38,790
just got skyrocketed now we had money to

931
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:40,310
go do everything that we've said that we

932
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:42,420
were gonna do in the past like hey

933
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:44,480
finally I can implement my security

934
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:46,620
program now because I have money right

935
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,820
finally I can go and I can do all the

936
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,989
stuff that I've been promising that I

937
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,090
can do and that I've been crying that I

938
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:54,660
that that we can't do because I didn't

939
00:30:51,090 --> 00:31:00,020
have money and we got our wish and then

940
00:30:54,660 --> 00:31:00,020
with all this money came the products

941
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:07,890
right you guys got money we got a

942
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:10,590
product they could fix this right and so

943
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:12,840
here you are at your desk overloaded

944
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:16,020
don't have enough people trying to find

945
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:18,899
people right okay I need I need a higher

946
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:22,170
I got 15 people I need to hire now and I

947
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:24,410
can't find talent but I got all this

948
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,410
cash

949
00:31:24,889 --> 00:31:32,120
and so now you have the product there

950
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,979
and what happened is is we we we spent

951
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,719
10 years as neglect and now we're

952
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,149
supposed to turn and protect the company

953
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,669
overnight and it does not happen you

954
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:44,340
can't fix years and years and years of

955
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:46,559
neglect in a day or a year or five years

956
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:48,480
it takes time and unfortunately it takes

957
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,749
time because it requires re-engineering

958
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,129
how your business does work and

959
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:55,139
fortunately or unfortunately the way

960
00:31:53,129 --> 00:31:57,029
that a business does work requires

961
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:58,850
technology and with technology comes a

962
00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:01,529
cost and that cost is security

963
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:04,340
interesting enough I've always been

964
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:06,330
against security reporting through IT

965
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,009
right it's always been the biggest

966
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:10,499
debate for us is that security needs a

967
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:12,659
bigger venue needs to report to the CFO

968
00:32:10,499 --> 00:32:14,070
or some risk oriented organization and I

969
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:17,240
agree with that in some companies that

970
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:19,678
works I just met with an organization

971
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,539
very big multi-billion dollar

972
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,940
organization where security reports

973
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:26,580
through IT but security controls 100

974
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:29,100
percent of the budget the entire IT

975
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:31,619
budget all budget goes through security

976
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,539
so if there's a new IT initiative and it

977
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:38,549
goes through security I have never seen

978
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:40,350
that before that is amazing so if you

979
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:42,809
have a new IT project one day it's got

980
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:44,009
to go through our process of security -

981
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:46,019
it's got to have enough funding to

982
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:47,399
incorporate security into it and three

983
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:49,669
we might or might not approve a based on

984
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:52,469
the risk that it has to the organization

985
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:54,570
that is amazing I almost dropped out of

986
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,100
my pants I dropped out of my seat there

987
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,658
am I very serious that's what happened a

988
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,678
good friend of mine I can't believe

989
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:03,960
pulled it off that was awesome on the

990
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:05,340
high pull it off but it's great so

991
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,470
they're around anywhere between five to

992
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:10,590
16 billion I'll put it in there in

993
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:12,899
manufacturing manufacturing of all the

994
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:16,350
industries out of all the industries are

995
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:18,600
the worst right yeah yeah not financial

996
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:20,789
financials usually under the risk you

997
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,668
know umbrella but anyways back to this

998
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:25,710
the technology era is born and what we

999
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:27,240
did is we tried to say ok well we don't

1000
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:29,879
have enough people we don't have enough

1001
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,470
stuff but we got all this cash so we're

1002
00:33:29,879 --> 00:33:32,639
gonna focus on implementing technology

1003
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:35,639
that can hopefully stop us and that's

1004
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:36,719
when you saw technology of a talent and

1005
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,629
what was interesting with that is that

1006
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,870
this industry now

1007
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:43,700
is all about negativity it's about how

1008
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:46,280
hackers are infiltrating organizations

1009
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:48,620
and stealing over money and without the

1010
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,790
technology to protect us there's no way

1011
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,070
for us to do we have artificial

1012
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:54,710
intelligence now that stops 99.9% of the

1013
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,990
hackers I almost crapped my pants when I

1014
00:33:54,710 --> 00:34:00,230
saw that at an airport that's what we're

1015
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:02,840
selling people you guys thought 99.9% of

1016
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:04,160
the hackers really I don't even know

1017
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:08,149
you'd notice your product is there when

1018
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:10,760
I'm hacking it I'm like oh you had this

1019
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:12,259
product oh yeah I was really hard to get

1020
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:17,060
her on I just used the same stuff that I

1021
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:18,290
use but it feels like we sucked because

1022
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,820
all of these vendors are telling us that

1023
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,159
we suck it feels like we suck because

1024
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:23,510
this whole whole product era is all

1025
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,940
about the negative if you don't buy our

1026
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,360
next generation product if you don't buy

1027
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:30,470
it

1028
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:32,750
it gets around it and so if you look at

1029
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:34,819
that as is kind of the key concepts of

1030
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:37,639
where we're at today the technology does

1031
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:39,409
not fix it in fact a good good analogy

1032
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:41,480
is we move to the next generation

1033
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:42,710
firewalls right and I love going into

1034
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,460
companies with next and firewalls

1035
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,720
because they're like hey we have a

1036
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,879
next-gen firewall and it's awesome it

1037
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,949
stops all these things right like what

1038
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:53,719
does it stop oh we don't know but it

1039
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:56,000
stops stuff right it's next-gen what I

1040
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:57,080
love is like hey we got all the I go

1041
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,920
back to the cache one because I can just

1042
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:03,500
keep going to cache all day long right

1043
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,820
so you have ten years of an a SA that's

1044
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,960
been sitting there are multiple ASAS

1045
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,900
that I'm senator and you have all of

1046
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,070
your people that are trained on ASAS but

1047
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,990
you have ten years of bad practices

1048
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:13,430
right like oh hey we have this firewall

1049
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:14,299
hole here and you know we love these

1050
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:16,160
ports out for this business

1051
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,090
justification and all other stuff and

1052
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:22,700
instead of doing the hard work which is

1053
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:23,990
reacting your network you buy a next-gen

1054
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,879
firewall because gonna give you this

1055
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:27,830
next generation capabilities right and

1056
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,560
so you have this appliance and then you

1057
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:33,230
take the Cisco importer tool and you

1058
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:36,380
import that into your Palo Alto and now

1059
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:37,610
you have next generation right doesn't

1060
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:41,300
doesn't work that way

1061
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:43,190
it does not work that way and so if you

1062
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:45,200
look at what we're facing now it's that

1063
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:47,150
we have a reliance off of technology

1064
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,549
versus the people and there's no way

1065
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:51,410
this industry will be successful when

1066
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,430
that is the case we will always figure

1067
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,600
out ways around the second

1068
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:56,210
we will always figure out ways around

1069
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,310
that but the people the tricky ones when

1070
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:59,960
I get busted in an organization doing a

1071
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,759
red team exercise it's the people that

1072
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,410
catch me they had something correct you

1073
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,660
know crazy you know that that I hadn't

1074
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:06,770
seen before that net that snags me in

1075
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,480
some way they didn't think about it and

1076
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:13,610
those that types of folks that you want

1077
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:15,260
in your team so I'm gonna show you a new

1078
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:17,090
version of unicorns is just released it

1079
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:28,690
but if you're interested you can go

1080
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:28,690
there my github site huh there we go

1081
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:43,009
zhenia play with unicorn before magic

1082
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:48,109
unicorn couple thank you thank you early

1083
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:49,760
adopter what's funny is uh I was in the

1084
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:51,260
middle is another good story class but I

1085
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,540
was in the middle of training at

1086
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,950
blackhat and I'm like you know you can't

1087
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,540
have you can't be called a hacker unless

1088
00:36:54,950 --> 00:37:01,009
you have a command-line tool that has

1089
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,940
ASCII art okay and it's just a rule like

1090
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,040
you're not a hacker until you do that

1091
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,660
right and so the one guy's like well

1092
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,520
that's not really a good tool because it

1093
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:09,410
doesn't have you know like red eyes like

1094
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,340
it'd be like it's an angry unicorn and

1095
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,140
so like right in the middle class I

1096
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:15,430
coded the red eyes and push the new get

1097
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:18,980
good request out so it has red eyes now

1098
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:21,680
real important real important but what

1099
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,790
unicorn does is is it's the PowerShell

1100
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,040
injection technique that talked about

1101
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:26,960
before and this latest version adds a

1102
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,250
lot of office keishon that was recently

1103
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,810
added to get around all the old ones out

1104
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:32,150
there what's great about this is it

1105
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:33,710
doesn't touch disk so you literally can

1106
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,210
copy and paste the command line argument

1107
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,770
that's PowerShell into an environment

1108
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:38,660
and it will execute code and compromise

1109
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:40,040
the machine what's nice about that is

1110
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,750
anywhere that you have remote command

1111
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,370
injection it works perfectly fine right

1112
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:44,840
so if you're going through like sequel

1113
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,160
injection and you find the XP command

1114
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,500
shell store procedure you can drop it

1115
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,670
into there and it works perfectly great

1116
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,230
so anywhere you have command injection

1117
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,340
you have to upload a binary you don't do

1118
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,560
any of that other stuff you can upload

1119
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:56,180
anything you want to into this

1120
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,799
it also supports creating the HTF files

1121
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,600
you saw earlier sort of create an HD a

1122
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,390
file for you one of the also the

1123
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:04,009
greatest ones to is it'll do macro

1124
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:06,470
injection as well so when you enable

1125
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:07,610
macros doesn't actually drop a VB

1126
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,720
scripts or anything like that in the

1127
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:11,210
machine it actually executes the

1128
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,589
PowerShell code as well and compromises

1129
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:14,330
the machine so it'll build the macro for

1130
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:20,990
you as well but let's go and use this

1131
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:24,080
real quick so I'm gonna specify the

1132
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:25,399
payload and my IP address again I can

1133
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:29,770
remember actually think I pasted it and

1134
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,770
I will see yep

1135
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:33,830
and we're going to generate the payload

1136
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:37,160
an IP address to connect back on and it

1137
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:39,650
automatically now what's nice about this

1138
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:46,029
is that it creates a RC file for you

1139
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:48,170
automatically and so what I can do is

1140
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:51,200
launch Metis play with a listener so

1141
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:54,610
just give it the RC file and reload for

1142
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,609
you and now I need to get my code

1143
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:13,180
let me get our command here you know you

1144
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:17,310
need to do again anywhere that you have

1145
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,310
remote Ropin ro ro command execution

1146
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:24,400
UAC spawn you can put that in anywhere

1147
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,960
right that's just a PowerShell command

1148
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,220
and it's base64-encoded it's kind of

1149
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:33,190
hard to see with the resolution can't

1150
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:37,060
believe they don't have and I can't but

1151
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:40,480
uh it just says PowerShell - hidden -

1152
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,870
windows - and coded I'm in do - NC for

1153
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,400
short

1154
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:45,790
now it's interesting as a lot of folks

1155
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,520
build things off of tools that are very

1156
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:50,170
predictable so like for example I know a

1157
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:53,350
lot of folks that that try to trigger on

1158
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,910
things like PowerShell Empire or you

1159
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:57,069
know corner things like that if you

1160
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:59,920
change these values around so instead of

1161
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:01,180
it being you know - W window - hidden

1162
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,610
you can switch those values around

1163
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,690
usually it escapes a lot of the evasion

1164
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,430
techniques out there just by switching

1165
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:09,370
those around a little bit which is

1166
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:10,690
pretty pretty silly but um you execute

1167
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:13,720
that it executes in the background and

1168
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:15,670
then you get your shell so we got

1169
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,720
ourself right there so again anywhere

1170
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,000
they hear remote command execution it

1171
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,959
works with all in the latest version

1172
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,510
compacts everything to a much smaller

1173
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:25,200
command-line argument so you can't fit

1174
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:29,200
the larger payloads like reverse HTTPS

1175
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,779
even with you know stage two I'll also

1176
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,230
fit in there as well so just ageless mr.

1177
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,670
Purcell

1178
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:37,530
so it works out really well on both

1179
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,530
fronts big fan

1180
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:49,770
and so talking about the term purple

1181
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:51,480
team it it's a term that really kind of

1182
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:53,340
has been around for a long time but a

1183
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,990
lot of folks are actually I think coming

1184
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,220
around to it now I think Chris is

1185
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:58,589
talking probably when the first people

1186
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,089
talked about it originally but the term

1187
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,710
purple team is something that works

1188
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:03,210
effectively on both sides and it's

1189
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:05,160
something that usually involves a third

1190
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,900
party coming in to do your traditional

1191
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,190
yearly pen tests and then after that you

1192
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,900
know you kind of get some results back

1193
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:12,060
from your team and it's back and forth

1194
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,920
going back and forth what we're seeing

1195
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,230
now is that the the evolution now of

1196
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,060
what we call purple team is more so

1197
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:21,000
either building it in-house to your

1198
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:22,680
organization or I'm having folks that

1199
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,820
work with you on an ongoing basis to

1200
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,960
actively go and do it and what's

1201
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,730
interesting about longer term

1202
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,920
engagements is you get better over time

1203
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:31,140
it can't just be an annual assessment

1204
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,180
that you do anymore that focuses on a

1205
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,410
specific short-term engagement going

1206
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,000
after things it has to be something

1207
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:37,410
that's ongoing that tests your defense

1208
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,150
that you get better at the get better at

1209
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:40,529
the detection capabilities because

1210
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:42,180
things are changing all the time ways

1211
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:43,050
that we do things all change all the

1212
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,460
time

1213
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:46,500
and those the types of things that you

1214
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,970
really need to focus on there I'll show

1215
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,250
you a couple ways on the defensive side

1216
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:51,600
that really make it difficult for us but

1217
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,680
those are gonna change in a month those

1218
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,750
are gonna change in two months those

1219
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:57,149
gonna change in six months is your team

1220
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:59,400
effectively testing those over a larger

1221
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:01,560
period of time to say well hey HTS are

1222
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,030
now in use for for ransomware and that's

1223
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,049
what we need to do to stop those I mean

1224
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:06,210
do you have those capabilities

1225
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:08,880
internally to understand those types of

1226
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:10,740
techniques and so if you look at

1227
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,990
penetration testing penetration testing

1228
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:15,600
has always been a point in time and it

1229
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:17,729
does provide value but it does not

1230
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,740
provide value when you're trying to get

1231
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:21,240
better at defenses a penetration test

1232
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,709
for us is like literally going in

1233
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,910
blowing up showing you how awesome we

1234
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,990
are at breaking into things and then

1235
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,279
kind of leaving that there right and

1236
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,779
then the team goes and fixes it and the

1237
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,190
next year you do the same thing and the

1238
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,480
blue team's like oh man these these

1239
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,890
folks are awesome they can break into

1240
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,440
anything that they want to that's not

1241
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:37,109
how it should be we have to focus more

1242
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,670
on the longer term type type of

1243
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:41,760
techniques we have so what are we go

1244
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:43,800
from here we're no longer in a position

1245
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,120
in this industry where defense cannot

1246
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,490
understand defense or offense can

1247
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,810
understand defense we have to be both so

1248
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:50,189
that means that when you're on the blue

1249
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:51,870
team and let's just say you're focused

1250
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,760
on formally management you need to

1251
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:55,319
understand exploitation techniques you

1252
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,120
need to understand how to actively go

1253
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,170
and attack things you

1254
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,490
keep up the things you need to go to

1255
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:00,020
DEFCON you need to go to black hey you

1256
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:03,919
need to go to hopefully do every kind of

1257
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:05,300
uh yay you need to understand what we're

1258
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,530
doing and we need to understand what

1259
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:10,010
you're doing you know you know what I

1260
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:11,750
love is going to a defensive talk I love

1261
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:13,250
going to defensive talks I'm like hey

1262
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,800
here's what we did in our environment

1263
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:17,630
that that made us a lot better at what

1264
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,070
we do I love hearing those talks I love

1265
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,510
understanding the rationale and a

1266
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:25,130
thought pattern behind doing things a

1267
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:26,600
good person to follow is Ben 10 he works

1268
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:30,080
for us a trusted sack

1269
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:31,819
Ben started off as an IT admin and he

1270
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,029
really took hold to defense but he did

1271
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:36,770
that by understanding offense first and

1272
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:38,180
so he's much better at defense than I am

1273
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:39,320
at defense but he understands the

1274
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,669
offense much better and he created

1275
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,100
what's called the posh tech framework

1276
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:44,660
it's a PowerShell way of being able to

1277
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,490
look for things intelligibly in your

1278
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,870
environment he's phenomenal at that

1279
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:49,279
but it's no law it should no longer be

1280
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:51,049
something mystical that we do is no

1281
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,250
longer something that hey we have this

1282
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:53,710
tool with this technique those are all

1283
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:56,480
things that we can actively go and learn

1284
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:59,300
some quick tips things that really jack

1285
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:02,120
us up on pen tests randomize our disable

1286
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:03,560
ad admins that's that's kind of a easy

1287
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,549
one to go through but I shouldn't have

1288
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,279
the same password on every single

1289
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:08,750
machine what's best is domain admins why

1290
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,590
does it domain Emma never need to log

1291
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:12,260
into a member server

1292
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:14,090
it never does ever there should never be

1293
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:16,150
an opportunity where a domain em and has

1294
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:17,930
ever logged into a member server period

1295
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:19,580
remove excessive account permissions

1296
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:21,200
vulnera management most of the ways that

1297
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,540
we get in still to this day are stupid

1298
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,040
things like Apache or Tomcat or JBoss or

1299
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,900
whatever we're seeing out there the

1300
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,430
things that are our basic that you pick

1301
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,380
up by a basic vulnerability scanner we

1302
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:33,470
don't need to do some crazy elite stuff

1303
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,910
to get into your organization stopping

1304
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,459
basic binaries and file types

1305
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:41,420
do you ever need an HD a file to execute

1306
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:42,950
ever no all right unless using some

1307
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,230
crazy horrible application you need to

1308
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:48,250
get rid of in the first place

1309
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:50,270
again that rainbow book from the 1990s

1310
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:51,530
and we're still dealing with that today

1311
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:54,980
is one of our most successful attack

1312
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:56,510
vectors so stop simple file types HCA's

1313
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,070
Power Cells a great example you should

1314
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:59,390
never execute or download power store

1315
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:02,030
from it from the internet unless you

1316
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:05,060
have specific exceptions stop basic

1317
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:06,470
binaries most infections occur in either

1318
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:09,170
the Downloads or the temperature Ector

1319
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:10,120
ease of the users the initial ones you

1320
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:12,250
can stop the home

1321
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,650
app blocker works like that it's free

1322
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:16,030
you have like right now and group policy

1323
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:17,580
you don't need like bit anion or

1324
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:20,620
anything like that this moment right

1325
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:22,600
that's another thing to you again in a

1326
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:25,120
second but you don't need a lot of it

1327
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,890
did you know within powers show if

1328
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,690
you're actually doing decent user rights

1329
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,740
management like you don't have local

1330
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:31,660
admins that are running on all your

1331
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:34,379
computers and power so you can disallow

1332
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:37,540
Power Cell execution to normal users

1333
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:39,640
that's a that's an app Locker feature so

1334
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:41,590
you can say hey no no users are allowed

1335
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,759
to use Power Cell period unless you're

1336
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:45,910
an administrator and part of the

1337
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,590
minister's group yeah today great way

1338
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,569
getting more visibility into the

1339
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:52,150
endpoints this is a tough one

1340
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:53,890
um I'm a I'm a big fan of getting more

1341
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:55,330
visibility into your environment but the

1342
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:57,129
problem is we have too much information

1343
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:58,720
going to our environments like Simms for

1344
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:00,280
example we're a great idea in concept

1345
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,689
because you know hey we're now getting

1346
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,190
all the visibility that we possibly need

1347
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:05,830
I meant in the environment no one knows

1348
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:07,330
what the hell to do with that data so

1349
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:08,950
now you just use like the default use

1350
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:11,470
case in like hey we have logarithm it

1351
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:12,879
has like 14 use cases that we can use so

1352
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:15,730
let's go ahead and like click those hit

1353
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,830
enable and now we got a sim right or hey

1354
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:19,240
we're feeding in semantics the triggers

1355
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:20,680
on the nanovirus alert we're gonna like

1356
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,939
send a alarm that we're gonna go

1357
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,190
investigate then do our incident

1358
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,480
response practices right that's what

1359
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:27,760
Sims have become it's an overload of

1360
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,440
data and so unless you understand what

1361
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,910
you're looking for you don't have the

1362
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,990
ability to actively look at what's

1363
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:33,940
actually happening at endpoints

1364
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:35,649
themselves so before you even do

1365
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:37,330
endpoints I'd recommend understand what

1366
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:38,950
that is in the first place and what you

1367
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:41,200
really need to be looking for there's

1368
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:43,870
some great logs on the ingen I think

1369
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,700
I've list no maybe not but there are

1370
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:47,160
some great logs that you can pull from

1371
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,660
your endpoints you don't need everything

1372
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,670
logon types are very important do you

1373
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:53,850
know if you do a log on type 3 and the

1374
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:55,990
service name is calling it as ntlmssp

1375
00:46:53,850 --> 00:47:01,060
allows you to type ass the hash in your

1376
00:46:55,990 --> 00:47:03,759
environment yeah log on sites threes

1377
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:05,190
remote write the service that gets

1378
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,790
called is the ntlmssp

1379
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:08,590
doesn't trigger unless you're actually

1380
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,730
using something that I know Nessus will

1381
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:10,870
trigger it every so often when they're

1382
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:12,550
doing it but you can put exceptions in

1383
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,450
for that as a false positive in most

1384
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:13,900
cases you're not gonna see that in your

1385
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:16,210
environment

1386
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:18,610
another good rule source desk source

1387
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:21,490
source IP address the same with multiple

1388
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:22,870
failed ntlmssp logins that's baller

1389
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:23,770
right that's like hey someone's trying

1390
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:26,339
to use a hash across

1391
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:28,420
entire environment and is jacked up

1392
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,860
PowerShell commands you know Microsoft

1393
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,970
now has the ability to take PowerShell

1394
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,160
commands and piped those out to event

1395
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:35,830
logs so the actual command that was run

1396
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:38,799
the PowerShell - ENC actually gets piped

1397
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:40,120
to your event locks if anybody's using -

1398
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,120
and code of commanding your environments

1399
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:44,890
that's probably not a good thing right

1400
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:46,870
or like you know hey invoke something

1401
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:48,460
right like ie X loaded you know download

1402
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:49,390
and directly execute a memory probably

1403
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,720
not a good thing in your environment

1404
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:54,339
don't recommend the actively using that

1405
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:56,230
you know removing execution restriction

1406
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:57,970
policies there could be legitimate

1407
00:47:56,230 --> 00:48:01,060
purposes for that in fact funny story

1408
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:04,930
the last service pack for exchange 2016

1409
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:07,090
it wasn't signed and so what what the

1410
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:09,100
Installer would actually do is just

1411
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:12,630
disable execution restriction policies

1412
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,630
installed stuff and never renamed alit

1413
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:17,229
awesome right amazing and everybody's

1414
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:20,620
worried about Windows 10 getting more

1415
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:22,000
secure that's great but those types of

1416
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,589
things you can find right now they're in

1417
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,970
event logs right now - for you to

1418
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:26,350
actually go and identify and you can

1419
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:27,189
just pull those and I'll talk a little

1420
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,509
out there and how you can actually do

1421
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:30,580
that with with Python some great stuff

1422
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:32,020
you can do in Python one of the one of

1423
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:33,279
the biggest GPOs that Jack's me up

1424
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:35,170
especially I'm trying to go in from a

1425
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,430
user compromise and then you know move

1426
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:39,490
laterally in different environments is

1427
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:41,770
this one this one messes me up every

1428
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:42,790
single time aspect so taking the deny

1429
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:45,940
access this computer from the network

1430
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:48,400
remove the administrators group remove

1431
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:51,790
the local administrators group what does

1432
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,830
that do does not allow me to do things

1433
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:55,509
like PS exactly pass the hash or W my

1434
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:57,220
injection and completely removes my

1435
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:58,840
ability to go and do that so you have

1436
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,700
your normal user accounts that are

1437
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,350
normal users you have your server

1438
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,520
administrators and then e of your

1439
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:05,380
workstation administrators that your

1440
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,600
helpdesk folks right that's all part of

1441
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:09,700
your domain so you don't need to have a

1442
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,190
local administrator group ever log into

1443
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:14,350
your machine ever in the history of ever

1444
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:15,850
remove that now if I compromised one

1445
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:18,040
machine and escalate my permissions and

1446
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:19,660
I grabbed the local admin hash where I

1447
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,200
figure out a way to move from one system

1448
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,420
to the other

1449
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,680
I don't have that ability to use those

1450
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,210
local admin rights in order for me to

1451
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,160
use something like PS exec or W my

1452
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:30,040
commands I need access to the C share

1453
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,540
the amateur admin shares raised I need

1454
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,800
permissions to actually go in ex-boy

1455
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:36,120
from so these are things that I heavily

1456
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:38,280
remember and I have you like

1457
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:40,500
so messin with red team this is one I

1458
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,300
favorites too so one of the things what

1459
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,650
I do when I compromise the system is I

1460
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,720
look for tokens that are available on

1461
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:47,130
the machine or Kerberos tokens or clear

1462
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,509
text passwords in memory like through W

1463
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:50,910
digest windows let me digest to me me

1464
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:53,760
can write me from there Mimi cats we all

1465
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:56,009
love Mimi cats right yeah all most of us

1466
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,390
do that from that offensive right but

1467
00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:00,390
what's interesting is with Windows 8 one

1468
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:02,370
and with everything Windows 8 1 and

1469
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:04,230
above they disable the clear text

1470
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:05,460
passwords in memory with WG digest but

1471
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,810
what's great is there's a registry entry

1472
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,340
that you can add that the next time a

1473
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:09,840
person logs in or automatic you store

1474
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:11,460
that again back in memory for you real

1475
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,690
time so what you can do and I do this

1476
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,820
all the time which is problem I don't

1477
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:16,230
mean may be good or not but I'll add the

1478
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:18,180
registry key and then I'll log somebody

1479
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:19,470
off and then as soon as they pop back on

1480
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,899
again I get their credentials which is

1481
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:24,120
fantastic right but what you can also do

1482
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:26,160
is this command right here if you see

1483
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,839
sub-process that p open that's just the

1484
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,790
Python command to run a command line

1485
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,560
that command line right there echo and

1486
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:33,060
that echo next to it as a password okay

1487
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,860
just randomize the pass wherever you

1488
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:37,590
want it to be and then you pipe it into

1489
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:38,940
run as user whatever your domain is and

1490
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:40,800
make it look like a sexy account when I

1491
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:42,510
heavily recommend is you make that

1492
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,610
domain you make that account in your

1493
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:46,710
domain make it a domain name and make it

1494
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:47,910
a crazy-ass password you know like a 50

1495
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,620
care capacitor you want to store in a

1496
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:51,480
safe and never use it password never

1497
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:53,910
expires and as soon as you see an

1498
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:56,030
invalid attempt on that specific

1499
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:57,990
password he know you've been compromised

1500
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:59,160
100% know that you've been compromised

1501
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:03,660
that should never trigger a false

1502
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:04,950
positive ever and what that does is it

1503
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,509
uses the net only command it doesn't

1504
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:08,640
actually actively go out to the domain

1505
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:10,020
to authenticate it opens a shell command

1506
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,670
prompt you can you can have it be

1507
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:13,800
notepad or whatever you want citizens be

1508
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:14,910
commanded exe what you do is just have a

1509
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,800
scheduled task where in your group

1510
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:19,049
policy infrastructure that deploys that

1511
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,370
out to run a scheduled task and it runs

1512
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:22,620
that through the entire environment and

1513
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:23,819
anything that I compromise has that that

1514
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:25,859
user name and password sitting in clear

1515
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:27,930
text in memory for me and as an attacker

1516
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:29,340
if I see a domain admin if I see a

1517
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:31,319
domain name especially if it's a legit

1518
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:33,060
domain name and in your domain I'm going

1519
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,500
after in two seconds I'm gonna start

1520
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,730
authenticate to another system and as

1521
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,920
soon as you get that invalid username a

1522
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:40,500
pass or logon type especially from login

1523
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,610
type three remote you know that

1524
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,490
something's wrong in your environment I

1525
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:46,950
love that one there's also what we call

1526
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:48,779
intrinsic and extrinsic WMI invents um

1527
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:49,500
there's some great modules and libraries

1528
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,630
inside of Python

1529
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,550
don't need python to do it but with

1530
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:55,710
intrinsic and extrinsic WMI events you

1531
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:59,610
can actually pull and query some really

1532
00:51:55,710 --> 00:52:01,620
awesome pieces of information from from

1533
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:03,570
your machines locally as well as within

1534
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:05,250
group policy this one specifically will

1535
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:06,810
pull if a new user has been added like

1536
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:08,130
an administrator or domain administrator

1537
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:10,020
or whatever that and I'll publish all

1538
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:12,810
this code after this I wrote it on the

1539
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:15,060
airplane I was coming here but I'll

1540
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:17,100
publish all this on my on the website

1541
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,930
here shortly but these types of things

1542
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,310
with intrinsic and extrinsic WMI events

1543
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:22,470
you can subscribe to certain events for

1544
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:24,750
certain classes um you can you know get

1545
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:26,879
alarms are alerts pushed to you through

1546
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:29,250
that and there they can be very specific

1547
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,410
it's basically WMI is basically sequel

1548
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:33,270
for your operating system it's

1549
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:34,640
phenomenal it's one of the most powerful

1550
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:37,200
things that you can leverage as a

1551
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,700
defensive person to look for things now

1552
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,069
a couple of things are warnings that

1553
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:42,839
I've learned using W my is you don't

1554
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:45,840
want it there's a specific thing you can

1555
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:49,320
query for WM is called Windows startup

1556
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,800
commands are a start a startup location

1557
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,330
sorry

1558
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,860
that's what Windows Start locations and

1559
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:54,270
what that does is it queries all the

1560
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:55,470
startup locations what you can do is you

1561
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:57,390
can build a baseline and say okay well

1562
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:58,890
here's my accepted startup locations and

1563
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:00,540
here's the accepted registry values so

1564
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:02,250
that you know someone decides to load

1565
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:04,380
something like persistence in there I'm

1566
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:06,060
not gonna allow it well if you have that

1567
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,710
if you if you do that on run time it

1568
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,970
actually locks the registry and end to

1569
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:11,070
user died and recreates the whole

1570
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:14,069
profile for the user it really sucks so

1571
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:15,510
don't use that for for logons but um I'm

1572
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:16,830
gonna side from that it's very stable

1573
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:20,280
it's something that you can can easily

1574
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:23,340
use one thing I will say is that in this

1575
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,720
industry it's very easy to say a lot of

1576
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:26,130
negatives it's very easy to say that

1577
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,540
we're all terrible in that we all suck

1578
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:30,180
and that the industry's going down or

1579
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:32,490
that you know we're failing as an entry

1580
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,720
we're not we're doing a lot better we're

1581
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:35,009
learning from one another and we're

1582
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:37,410
doing a lot better than we did ten years

1583
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:40,440
ago the problem is is that this industry

1584
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:41,940
is being taken over by products products

1585
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,740
that are saying that they can do things

1586
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:45,660
that they cannot products that are

1587
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:47,640
saying that they can stop hackers when

1588
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:49,049
they cannot I have yet to find one I

1589
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,970
don't know if anybody else has found one

1590
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:52,650
that magically stops hackers I don't

1591
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:55,370
know if that happens so me can you make

1592
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:58,410
out one that magically stopped attackers

1593
00:53:55,370 --> 00:54:01,259
so I actually I got I got I got seven

1594
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:02,500
minutes I want to show you we we hit

1595
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:06,670
Spybot

1596
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:08,830
I want to show you we actually developed

1597
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:09,790
a tool that stops 100% attackers I want

1598
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:11,680
to show this to you real quick so we got

1599
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:16,150
I got time I got seven minutes so it's

1600
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:17,440
well worth it's well worth that's

1601
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:20,590
exactly what it is another way actually

1602
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:23,290
isn't so give me one second let me find

1603
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:34,360
it it's untrusted SEC TV we do stupid

1604
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:35,470
stuff right here you want to stop a

1605
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:42,940
hundred percent of the hackers we got

1606
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:44,890
you here at trusted SEC we have created

1607
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:47,140
the number one product out there that

1608
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:54,220
you must have right now we call it the

1609
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:56,190
hacker vaccine this technology has been

1610
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:58,120
in development for the past two weeks

1611
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:59,410
it's something that we did all that we

1612
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,000
know will make will completely change

1613
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:03,580
the industry for the better something

1614
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,530
that not only guarantees 100% full

1615
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:07,509
coverage of stopping all the hackers and

1616
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:09,490
the traps what do you think 99% is good

1617
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:12,400
enough so I'm looking full 100% coverage

1618
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:13,779
on all hacking attempts and will

1619
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,560
completely shut down the hackers right

1620
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:17,110
in the footsteps

1621
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:18,940
we're so excited here that we are having

1622
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:20,290
a release party here next week just to

1623
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,670
be able to celebrate the release of just

1624
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:23,920
a new piece of technology I mean we

1625
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:26,580
believe is revolutionary as usable

1626
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,580
market movements

1627
00:55:29,049 --> 00:55:33,440
this is people I ask how does the hacker

1628
00:55:31,279 --> 00:55:34,730
vaccine work how can you stop 100% of

1629
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,380
the attack yourself that's a good

1630
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:37,970
question you know when we were sitting

1631
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:40,130
there trying to figure out exactly how

1632
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:41,660
to stop hackers in the tracks we knew

1633
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:43,309
that the only way possible was to

1634
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:45,259
develop sophisticated artificial

1635
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:47,000
intelligence that goes through your

1636
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,529
entire network and it completely shuts

1637
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,640
down all the computers in your

1638
00:55:48,529 --> 00:55:50,960
environment so that people can't use

1639
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,000
their computers for hackers to break

1640
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,220
into it this revolutionary concept was

1641
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,079
now pat pending and completely shut down

1642
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:59,118
all your environments all of your users

1643
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:00,950
so they can no longer work download

1644
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,299
those pesky viruses and there you go

1645
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:04,279
there's the problem it's all that's now

1646
00:56:02,299 --> 00:56:06,019
fixed I used to be afraid that my

1647
00:56:04,279 --> 00:56:07,609
computer would be hiked into but I no

1648
00:56:06,019 --> 00:56:15,529
longer need to worry because it's turned

1649
00:56:07,609 --> 00:56:18,230
off Thanks trusted second with our

1650
00:56:15,529 --> 00:56:19,460
latest version version 10.1 I'm going to

1651
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:22,150
be releasing a new model quality

1652
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,150
enforcement

1653
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:33,000
what's great about the enforcer is it

1654
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:34,859
not only does it strike the attacker for

1655
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,020
the camp club he's sophisticated sexy

1656
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:39,299
stone pink your uncle locate exactly

1657
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:41,280
where the Han River coming from and then

1658
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:45,380
we deploy antigens in order to actually

1659
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,380
go in to stop the hackers little overdue

1660
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:58,809
it's a random longshot up already

1661
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:17,990
it's in for sometime

1662
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:24,870
our courser module literally sent

1663
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:26,190
somebody to somebody's house keys them

1664
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:27,990
up and make sure to make sure that they

1665
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:30,120
don't ever hack you again this is our

1666
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:33,890
guarantee 107 they will never touch your

1667
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:33,890
computer system regardless of Warcraft

1668
00:57:48,049 --> 00:57:52,529
so I'll close up with we all need to be

1669
00:57:51,269 --> 00:57:54,988
purple we all need to understand one

1670
00:57:52,529 --> 00:57:56,699
another and there's a couple there's a

1671
00:57:54,989 --> 00:57:57,929
there's a book that really like out

1672
00:57:56,699 --> 00:58:00,359
there I really recommend it's called

1673
00:57:57,929 --> 00:58:03,179
originals and it's by a professor out of

1674
00:58:00,359 --> 00:58:05,669
Wharton that talks about people that

1675
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:06,959
were able to change their industries and

1676
00:58:05,669 --> 00:58:09,058
go in a completely different direction

1677
00:58:06,959 --> 00:58:10,618
and it's it talks a little bit about

1678
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:12,179
Steve Jobs and all of his failures that

1679
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:13,919
he had and a lot of the other folks are

1680
00:58:12,179 --> 00:58:16,469
out there Elon Musk is a good example of

1681
00:58:13,919 --> 00:58:18,239
that but ultimately what did they do to

1682
00:58:16,469 --> 00:58:20,609
change the pattern behavior like for

1683
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:22,139
example SpaceX was a completely

1684
00:58:20,609 --> 00:58:23,308
different market than it is today you

1685
00:58:22,139 --> 00:58:25,019
know using off-the-shelf commercial

1686
00:58:23,309 --> 00:58:27,899
products they actually build a rocket

1687
00:58:25,019 --> 00:58:29,279
ship that can land itself the way that

1688
00:58:27,899 --> 00:58:31,469
you change this industry is by working

1689
00:58:29,279 --> 00:58:33,419
together being positive but also knowing

1690
00:58:31,469 --> 00:58:35,489
that's gonna take a lot of hard work and

1691
00:58:33,419 --> 00:58:37,019
that comes with having to learn what

1692
00:58:35,489 --> 00:58:39,329
we're doing and how the attackers are

1693
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:41,459
working and that I learn every day new

1694
00:58:39,329 --> 00:58:43,019
techniques I learned in you know every

1695
00:58:41,459 --> 00:58:45,359
single day new techniques to defend and

1696
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:46,799
both both on the offensive side we have

1697
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:48,119
to get better understanding each other

1698
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:50,639
else this industry isn't going to be

1699
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:51,869
successful so I want to open up to any

1700
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:53,789
questions or anything else that anybody

1701
00:58:51,869 --> 00:59:01,319
has I'd be happy to answer that or if

1702
00:58:53,789 --> 00:59:03,269
not I'll take off any questions always

1703
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:04,799
Derby to hotels Derby is not in two

1704
00:59:03,269 --> 00:59:08,038
hotels this year it is at the Hyatt we

1705
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:09,630
we decided against it so yeah yeah we

1706
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:10,709
decided against moving and splitting it

1707
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:12,179
up we thought that would kind of hinder

1708
00:59:10,709 --> 00:59:13,049
from the conference but you know we're

1709
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:14,669
seeing it that we're staying at the

1710
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:16,380
Hyatt this year we're staying at the

1711
00:59:14,669 --> 00:59:17,939
Hyatt next year and and that's you know

1712
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:21,289
whatever is beyond there so it's gonna

1713
00:59:17,939 --> 00:59:23,839
be the same same same place each time

1714
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:25,189
same as last year we're cutting it we

1715
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:28,828
derbycon

1716
00:59:25,189 --> 00:59:30,989
three we had 2,600 people knows too much

1717
00:59:28,829 --> 00:59:33,449
so there'd be kind of four and five we

1718
00:59:30,989 --> 00:59:35,429
cut it back to 2000 and that's seem to

1719
00:59:33,449 --> 00:59:36,479
be okay still a little packed especially

1720
00:59:35,429 --> 00:59:37,709
some of the rooms some of the good talks

1721
00:59:36,479 --> 00:59:38,759
but at least everybody was able to get

1722
00:59:37,709 --> 00:59:40,888
into most of the rooms that they needed

1723
00:59:38,759 --> 00:59:44,130
to we'll keep it at that you know 2000

1724
00:59:40,889 --> 00:59:44,939
is kind of our cutoff at that all right

1725
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:47,509
well thanks so much for having me out

1726
00:59:44,939 --> 00:59:47,509
here I appreciate it
