1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:11,010
morning everybody first of all I did try

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,780
to set up some opening notes but I

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,299
really suck at that so I'm just going to

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,320
kind of roll with it here first of all

5
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:20,970
welcome to the first b-sides Calgary

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,070
took a lot of work more than expected

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,790
but we managed to pull it off and to

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,760
have a sold-out house is an absolute

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:31,380
pleasure for free year one here so thank

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:37,019
you for participating thank you for

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:39,390
joining our events and for those people

12
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:40,980
that didn't quite make it in I apologize

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,710
if we had more seating they would have

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,559
been here but I'll send them a a note

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,649
later we have a great lineup of speakers

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,199
for you today and tomorrow we've got all

17
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,859
kinds of topics from covering the

18
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,030
darknet to the origins of b-sides we're

19
00:00:54,859 --> 00:01:00,629
quite honored to have a couple of the

20
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,059
cofounders of b-sides besides global I

21
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,739
guess being our keynotes for today and

22
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,509
tomorrow we have Jack Daniel who

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,479
probably probably needs no introduction

24
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,969
or shouldn't and Chris Nickerson

25
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,780

26
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:18,919

41
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,740

thank you thanks for being here thanks

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:28,000
for getting up at this hour for hacker

53
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:30,370
con 9s ungodly early see if I can deal

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,760
with technology now let's look at that

55
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,350
it may work so yeah besides Calgary

56
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,929
hopefully you figured that out by now

57
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:40,350
that's where we are I'm going to talk a

58
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,300
little bit about history and hackers and

59
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:46,540
stuff I have a day job I work for

60
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,880
tenable network security they let me do

61
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,670
stuff like this a lot of what I do for

62
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,470
besides is because they support me in

63
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,570
doing that it's interesting that the

64
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:59,109
vulnerability management vendors have

65
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:01,690
traditionally supported b-sides the all

66
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,930
the big names in our space tend to be

67
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:07,930
engaged with b-sides and so the other

68
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,880
folks that do what the sales teams i

69
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:15,430
work with do at other companies are all

70
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:17,590
part of this community and the dude who

71
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:21,610
gets too much credit for b-sides I'm an

72
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,810
enabler I connect people provide a

73
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,240
little moral support and I get way too

74
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,340
much credit but moving on i'm very happy

75
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,110
i was here last fall and I thought hey I

76
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,380
kind of like Calgary I'd never been here

77
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:34,120
before it's it's got kind of a subtle

78
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,560
and sometimes not so subtle weirdness

79
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,360
but you're all just cool with it it's

80
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,690
not like Austin where everybody like

81
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,700
we're weird okay I know just calm down

82
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:45,240
really it's all right it's just like I

83
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:48,130
did why is there a nicely dressed woman

84
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,990
you know in a mini skirt chasing a

85
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,730
rabbit around a little patch of grass in

86
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,320
the middle of the parking lot and why is

87
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,049
it I'm the only one in the street and

88
00:03:53,320 --> 00:04:03,220
even notices or cares oh it's SE Calgary

89
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:05,080
okay I'm sorry and yeah and I really

90
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:11,080
mean that I have no ulterior motives in

91
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:18,100
saying how much i love Canada oh okay

92
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:21,340
and maybe just one look more than one so

93
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:24,120
I guess this is my payback for making

94
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:24,119
fun of Rob Ford

95
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:34,230
Wow so anyway you are here what does

96
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,520

97
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:40,730
be sites have been around the globe the

98
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:45,359

99
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:50,160
first-time event cities coming up later

100

101
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,080

113
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:44,820

117
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,410
with one on a boat well there was almost

118
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,610
one on a boat but then they realized

119
00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:02,250
what the cost is going to be so that

120
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:04,740
didn't happen um disclaimer this is my

121
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:09,960
story as I remember it and with my

122
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:11,789
perspective oh I spend too much time

123
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,260
with PowerPoint and my version of

124
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:14,760
PowerPoint has become sentient and

125
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,340
sometimes it makes fun of me and argues

126
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,289
with me and for the record I do remember

127
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,239
actually I just drank coffee and water

128
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:23,849
for breakfast I may have been at milk

129
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,150
tiger last night but that was before

130
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:31,039
midnight so it wasn't this morning so

131
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,039
here we go how did we start here

132
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,590

133
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:39,960

vegas the air conditioning didn't work

135
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,719
in the big room so garbage bags and duct

136
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,340
tape and anything else we could find got

137
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:52,710
stuck on every window and everything

138
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:54,659
else yes that's fans and portable air

139
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:58,169
conditioners so that we kept it under

140
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:03,780
about 85-90 in that room wow maybe under

141
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:07,500

full of people if you want to go to the

145
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,650
talk to talks were great they were talks

146
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,360
upstairs and downstairs there's a

147
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:18,150
swimming pool out back there was a grill

148
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,650
out back if you didn't want to be part

149
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:22,799
of the conversation that was going on in

150
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:27,270
the presentation you had a formal hall

151
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:31,919
con that's the edge of a gender inch

152
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:35,969
gender issues in infosec panel at a

153
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:38,190
hacker con in july of 2009 five years

154
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:41,220
later RSA started making a really big

155
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:46,940
deal about addressing gender issues in

156
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:51,450
infosec in a panel that's gin Jabba sh

157

lee honeywell lee hollowell lee and i

158
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:59,669
think lawyer lives was on that it was an

159
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:01,500
absolute all-star panel was amazing and

160
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:03,330
it wasn't really we weren't trying to

161
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,030
change the world we were just trying to

162
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,590
provide an alternative I have to say we

163
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,179
don't compete with black hat because we

164
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,419
make nice with everybody we play with

165
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,919
now most b-sides aren't parallel with

166
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,599
another event we try not to step on

167
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,520
other people's toes because I had to

168
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,610
spend way too many years apologizing to

169
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:25,169
people and putting things back together

170
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:27,240
but black hat maybe needed a nudge back

171
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:31,400
then can we say that does its thing he

172
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:34,289
did a nudge and we were it oh yeah and

173
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:38,610
we did that first year everything didn't

174
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:40,610
quite go perfectly smoothly Chris this

175
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:44,600
one's for you right

176
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:48,740
I know I know I thought we agreed never

177
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:51,200
to mention that again look we didn't

178
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,880
actually burn the house down and since

179
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,740
the circuit breaker didn't trip and the

180
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,370
smoke alarm didn't go off the landlord

181
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:01,579
stuffed the colt 1911 back in his belt

182
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,320
and didn't shoot Chris it was ok and so

183
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:09,319
we got here right here we are these

184
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:11,050
years later so how do we get here so

185
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,390
this is the first time here in Calgary

186
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:18,529
who's here at first time ever going to a

187
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:20,899
b-sides event I look around Chris look

188
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:24,649
at this this is fantastic thank you so

189
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:27,019
much so what does it take to build this

190
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:30,200
a growing community it takes a growing

191
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:35,959
foundation so unlike those other

192
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:37,370
conferences that I won't name to build a

193
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:39,949
growing community you need a growing

194
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,839
foundation that means every one of you

195
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,519
who has never been at a B sides before

196
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,220

198
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,990
foundation of d sites because that's the

199
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,670
way it grows so thank you for joining us

200
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,470
and thank you and welcome to the

201
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:59,029
founders circle whether it's your first

202
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:02,589
time or like mine the 56th b-sides a

203
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:06,350
minute so who else what else did it take

204
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:09,529
we can't not talk about 303 the 303

205
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:11,660
crowd the Denver area crowd rented a

206
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:13,760
house Chris rented a house and offered

207
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,100
that up for that first b-sides and a lot

208
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,680
of 303 people were there and made things

209
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,329
happen but a lot of other people and I

210
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,399
wanted to mention 303 because one of the

211
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:26,140
things I occasionally hear from outside

212
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:29,720
of the Denver area is that it's a click

213
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:31,130
they don't they don't i don't plan how

214
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,779
they have their own things they do their

215
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,980
own thing at defcon they do that sky

216
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:37,610
talks thing because they're like too

217
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:40,250
good they did it I had never met anybody

218
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:43,399
in person from 303 when I showed up at

219
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:45,470
the first event others of us hadn't I

220
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,170
was pretty well known in the Northeast

221
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,569
the u.s. Boston Providence area and to a

222
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,880
certain extent the DC but I showed up

223
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:54,410
and I didn't know what I could do but i

224
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,970
figured i will show up and I

225
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,110
will do stuff I'd helped lined up a

226
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,480
little sponsorship and little

227
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,860
organization and I just did stuff and

228
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,540
anybody that showed up and did stuff

229
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,870
which was everybody at that first

230
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:08,149
b-sides was just part of the family so

231
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,589
303 was it was a critical catalyst in it

232
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:12,889
but everybody else just made things

233
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:16,220
happen and some interesting stuff

234
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:20,810
happened strangers became friends who

235
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:23,149
became family and when I say that I mean

236
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,810
it that's I have a reputation as a

237
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:29,269
cranky old bastard because I am however

238
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:31,579
I have friends from the b-sides

239
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:36,980
community who are closer than my real

240
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:38,540
family because of this it's why I get to

241
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,180
as many besides as I can and want to be

242
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:44,449
part of the community as it grows so

243
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:46,160
family yes complete with creepy uncles I

244
00:11:44,449 --> 00:12:08,990
think that's it I think it's making fun

245
00:11:46,160 --> 00:12:11,480
of me how does this work so you probably

246
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:14,149
well you know how these things start one

247
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,939
guy tells another guy's son and then he

248
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:19,310
tells two friends and they tell two

249
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:24,589
friends and they tell their friends and

250
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:25,910
so on and so and so so that's what it

251
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:28,970
that's what it did it was a word of

252
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:30,920
mouth you know you it took off the first

253
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,930
year there were five events as a recall

254
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,229
Mountain View California San Francisco

255
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,130
Austin Denver and then back to Vegas

256
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:40,040
what does it take to make this happen

257
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:42,380
like the event we're sitting it now it

258
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,149
takes organizers the people that like

259
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,309
struggle to make this happen so we're

260
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:47,540
gonna do it simply right when it's good

261
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:49,490
some people to nod bring it it pretty

262
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,750
simple our first time out well we're

263
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,509
going to do this too we're going to oh

264
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:55,790
my god what have we gotten into but they

265
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:58,519
stick to it make it happen right it

266
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:02,000
takes people to show up and speak it

267
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:04,279
takes sponsors but it can't happen

268
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,110
without that the cost can't be as low as

269
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,180
it is without that or free for sometimes

270
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:11,540
it takes volunteers and it take

271
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,279
participants takes all of those working

272
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:17,599
together and a couple of those words are

273
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:22,189
important to me so sort of my ethos here

274
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,230
first participants not attendees you are

275
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:27,290
not an attendee or a participant please

276
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:30,610
participate be part of it sponsors not

277
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:35,149
vendors yes the giant trade shows have

278
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:37,700
sponsors right we want the folks that

279
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:40,070
sponsor these events to be part of the

280
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:43,940
community many of them are many of us

281
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:45,350
are the company I used to work for was

282
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,959
the first company to put down any money

283
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,640
at all and we spent more than we could

284
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:52,849
justify but they saw the future in it

285
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,439
and nobody had heard of a star oh and i

286
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,690
think the the few years of b-sides

287
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,029
before they were acquired by sophos got

288
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,770
a star Oh more publicity at least in the

289
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:02,689
US market than they had ever done with

290
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:07,040
anything they've done so like oh these

291
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:09,110
guys are cool and so I used to talk

292
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,550
about the three C's of b-sides and I had

293
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,080
at a fourth C because once I realized

294
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,890
what the first three season at the

295
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:18,470
fourth one came content community and

296
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:20,330
conversation are what b-sides are about

297
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:23,510
content community and conversation

298
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:27,050
connecting people with good content and

299
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:28,630
having meaningful conversations well it

300
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:33,579
turns out if you do those three things

301
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:36,860
it has a positive impact on career from

302
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,910
people who want to join the industry the

303
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,490
people that are just coming out of

304
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,319
school trying to figure out where to go

305
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,790
from school to those of us that might

306
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,370
have been in it long enough that we're

307
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:49,370
figuring out where we're going to retire

308
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:51,110
and open that little tiki bar and say to

309
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:55,970
heck with odd and the order of those

310
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:58,579
varies by person what's a successful

311
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:01,520
b-sides this is easy most people leave

312
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:03,050
happy most is important you've met us

313
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,300
right whether you're in the hacker world

314
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:07,310
or infosec world you've met us we're not

315
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,229
going to make everybody happy and the

316
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,189
organizers leave content don't have to

317
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,020
leave a happy because we're

318
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:15,920
self-critical we tend to be very

319
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:17,540
self-critical what everybody leaves most

320
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,579
people leave happy organizers leave

321
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,810
content this team is talking about how

322
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:21,599
to do it better next year I'm going to

323
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,250
go plug one

324
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,319
the ways they can do it better next

325
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,399
year's they have talked to them and make

326
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:27,389
sure we have all the volunteers they

327
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,449
need although they have a phenomenal

328
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:32,639
staff but volunteers make this happen as

329
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:34,979
well as everything else if you're new to

330
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,329
it you want to know why some of us have

331
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,980
the pride in this that we do put the

332
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:43,979
effort in that we do put as much effort

333
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:47,190
at the b-sides wiki security besides org

334
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:51,660
or com yes it's horrible wiki no HTTPS

335
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:56,610
is broken it's pbworks who's not my

336
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:58,529
choice was not Chris's choice but now

337
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,850
it's a classic case of software

338
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:01,470
Stockholm Syndrome if you're not

339
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:04,079
familiar with that you start to identify

340
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:05,730
with your captors in this case it's

341
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,310
pbworks because we have all these years

342
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,509
of history in there if you're an Oracle

343
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:16,319
customer you know what software

344
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:20,870
Stockholm Syndrome is so anyway there's

345
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:23,519
a page of what besides means to me I

346
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,680
won't read them but there's just I don't

347
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,620
know they're 60 or 80 things on there

348
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,949
and words like local and content and

349
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:34,380
family and career and approachable and

350
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:38,969
different come up over and over and over

351
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:41,519
again so so join us in that that

352
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:43,500
conversation that community and we'll

353
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,319
get a little bit more community I had to

354
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,480
go there a community so we like to talk

355
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:51,630
about the infosec community we like to

356
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,589
talk about the hacker community there's

357
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:58,170
really a lot of different communities I

358
00:16:54,589 --> 00:17:00,269
actually like the sociologist term of

359
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,949
tribes because tribes and nations kind

360
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,839
of works better because their hacker

361
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:06,359
tribes and their part of the big hacker

362
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:10,049
nation you know we may show up at Def

363
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:12,658
Con is the infosec tribes may show up at

364
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:14,309
RSA or infosecurity Europe but we're

365
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:16,140
different tribes part of a part of a

366
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:17,699
larger nation and one of the challenges

367
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,470
I see and one of the things that besides

368
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,500
can help with is I see a lot of

369
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:26,679
different splits so there's one when you

370
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:31,640
meet somebody in an event what do you do

371
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:34,340
I'm a hacker or I work in infosec or I'm

372
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,720
an infosec professional and in there

373
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,500
those of us who straddled two divided

374
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:42,320
right so I'm in China or you know

375
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:46,760
Chinese smoking jacket and top hat in my

376
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:49,370
in my foolish beard and I kind of fit

377
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,960
there and then I kind of stand out but

378
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,699
thankfully their folks like with diffie

379
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,510
and others who make me not look quite as

380
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,919
weird on the other side and it's a

381
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,370
little awkward when our friends start to

382
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,419
battle and that happens occasionally I

383
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,649
mean we could sliced up way too many

384
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:06,169
ways a lot of people do it as a hobby

385
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,610
they may be in technology or may not but

386
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:11,090
they love to act stuff and it's fun

387
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:12,649
that's cool some people just consider

388
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,240
themselves professional some people

389
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,250
defend companies for a living whether

390
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,370
they're red team or blue team another

391
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:21,530
division i didn't put in here you know

392
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:24,080
but you're defending a major corporation

393
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:25,820
or a small company and then there's you

394
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,889
know us horrible vendor pimps right

395
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,720
because and then even amongst our us we

396
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,760
have to fight over all right I do

397
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,290
services you're just pushing boxes are

398
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,120
you just pushing out really come on and

399
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,620
then it is academia they don't

400
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,000
understand the real world we don't

401
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,860
understand them even though they have

402
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,750
some amazing ideas and we wouldn't and

403
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,219
then there's government and military and

404
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,750
if you don't deal with them you tend to

405
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:50,480
lump those two together and that's a

406
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:53,720
really bad idea and then we stratify

407
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,070
even in their trench warriors these are

408
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,520
people actually do unlike

409
00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:00,110
management

410
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,610
various strata of management executives

411
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:05,629
and then Outsiders with a lot of

412
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:08,658
opinions a couple of splits imposter

413
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:12,140
syndrome and manly that's a little mean

414
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:13,610
jack it is I did go there but thankfully

415
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,419
there are more people with impostor

416
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:19,100
syndrome than the other but we're best

417
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:20,480
when we bridge these divides and that's

418
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:24,408
sometimes I want to talk about for a

419
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:27,890
minute and what b-sides can help do so

420
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:29,809
let's let's talk about hackers a little

421
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:33,309
over 30 years ago the hacker manifesto

422
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:35,889
came out and frack and two I wrote it

423
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:38,658
really resonated with a lot of people I

424
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:43,250
will say this it was really not very

425
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:44,659
well written I can't yeah I get what he

426
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,200
was trying to say but it wasn't very

427
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:50,510
eloquent but at the end there was one of

428
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,860
the last paragraph or almost like yes

429
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,408
I'm a criminal my crime is that of

430
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:56,299
curiosity my crime is that of judging

431
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:58,549
people by what they say and think not

432
00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:00,470
what they look like my crime is that of

433
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:04,100
outsmarting you something that you will

434
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:07,100
never forgive me for what parts of that

435
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:10,070
except for the criminal stuff i wouldnt

436
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:12,320
try what people did decades ago now it

437
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,178
would be bad for you especially if you

438
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,590
happen to be somewhere where they'll

439
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,970
extradite you to the US because

440
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,289
apparently we have no sense of humor and

441
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,419
we're really frustrated that we can't

442
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:22,100
get like the Ukrainians and North

443
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,659
Koreans and therefore we just slammed

444
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:27,230
people that she get a slap on the wrist

445
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:30,830
in jail for decades but part of that you

446
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:33,409
know judging people online I hate the

447
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,539
phrase duoc recei but you know some sort

448
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:38,350
of merit based thing and it doesn't have

449
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:40,669
to be brilliance it can be participation

450
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:45,590
that kind of leads into thing so I am a

451
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:48,200
hacker not this kind there is a ton of

452
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:50,779
really crappy clipart about hackers out

453
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,870
there on the internet I have found what

454
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:58,820
I think may be the most accurate stock

455
00:20:53,870 --> 00:21:02,229
photo of a hacker on the internet just

456
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,230
let me finish this and ok

457
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:11,830
what does that mean I think it's

458
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,870
something I they're all sorts of

459
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:16,270
definitions I can argue definitions but

460
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:19,750
I've got some ideas one of the key ideas

461
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:21,250
to me about what hacker means it's not a

462
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,250
criminal it's not the mainstream

463
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:26,110
definition it's it's curiosity you know

464
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:30,100
a childlike sense of wonder and

465
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:32,830
curiosity ooh what's that what can I do

466
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,100
with it don't do that with it uh-huh

467
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:37,899
what happens if I do that with it right

468
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:45,668
sometimes it's childish too but that's a

469
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:50,049
whole nother talk testing limits we push

470
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:51,940
push things to the edge sometimes

471
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:53,470
because it's fun to break let's be

472
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,540
honest right let's be honest sometimes

473
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,480
it's fun to break stuff but it's not

474
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:01,270
just breaking stuff it's how it breaks

475
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,970
why it breaks what it took to do that

476
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:07,960
what the post break situation is how do

477
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:12,700
I make it stronger how to prevent or

478
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:16,570
delay breaking sort of a cycle of break

479
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:18,640
fix improved repeat right and part of

480
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,409
that cycle in the earlier days of the

481
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,679
hacker world when everybody was on BBS's

482
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:26,590
are met up at the food court at the mall

483
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:35,250
or wherever people met and def con at

484
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:35,250
some cons was this learn share repeat

485
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,960
these sides are an opportunity there are

486
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,820
other events too but we're to be side so

487
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,520
I'm going to talk about visa these sides

488
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:48,549
are an opportunity to do this learn

489
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,929
share and repeat now my background is

490
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:51,580
automotive so this kind of reminds me of

491
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:54,340
the hot-rodders because we would drive

492
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,780
we push our cars until it broke and then

493
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,379
we would fix them and try to figure out

494
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:01,570
how to keep that from breaking again and

495
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:03,790
then we do it again and again and then

496
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,830
about second or third time we'd be like

497
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,510
oh time to upgrade the brakes because I

498
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:09,790
keep running off the road now that I

499
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,679
have more power but it's the same cycle

500
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:14,080
but you know the bottom line is the

501
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,669
world's a puzzle to us we want to

502
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,439
understand it we want to play with it we

503
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:19,809
want to know where we fit into it and

504
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,620
we're one of the pieces we play with so

505
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:27,690
that's awesome get that quickly clicker

506
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:31,178
happy but here's one of our challenges

507
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:33,250
I'm doing this fun stuff oh oh my

508
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:38,050
goodness somebody's gonna pay me to do

509
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:40,809
this I got a job doing what I love this

510
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:42,790
is not just a job I have a career this

511
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:49,510
is awesome I have made a career out of

512
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:52,330
my hobby but but that means I've gotta

513
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:56,200
write reports means i got TPS reports

514
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:58,270
that means i gotta explain why doing

515
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:02,429
this to that machine is problematic i

516
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,429
have to explain why this exposes us

517
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,120
there are some of the early hacker

518
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:13,990
community sees just the spot in some of

519
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:17,070
the loft crew that became at stake and

520
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:19,900
have scattered around some rivera code

521
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:22,809
it's a hobby holy crap we can make money

522
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,610
out of our hobby oh it's like a real job

523
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:28,450
oh my goodness we've made a career out

524
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:30,610
of it it's not that fun anymore but

525
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,780
there's still a spark of fun we've grown

526
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,550
you don't we need to do we need to grow

527
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:37,600
the company so we need to find people

528
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:46,149
who had that spark that curiosity hire

529
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:47,230
them and drive it out of them to man but

530
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,580
money is part of that you know I mean

531
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:52,530
how many people are dropping OD at Def

532
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:54,399
Con right and for the four businesses I

533
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:55,870
spend time talking to people that are

534
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,299
trying to defend their environments bug

535
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:03,668
bounties are cool but bounties are a

536
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:04,960
great evolution of not just not suing

537
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:07,540
people when they find something wrong

538
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,669
with your stuff but actually encouraging

539
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,350
people to do it in a controlled and dare

540
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:13,480
I say responsible way although I hate

541
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:15,370
the word responsible responsible is

542
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,500
usually a word that is used against

543
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:22,800
people who find vulnerabilities

544
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:25,500
responsible disclosure and I'm

545
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,790
any leet haxor when it comes to break

546
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,870
and stuff but all you have to do is pay

547
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,180
attention on the web to find

548
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:33,570
vulnerabilities and I'm not saying boat

549
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:36,060
running or anything else you just do but

550
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:37,470
the money is made it different so what

551
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,080
do we do remember what got us started

552
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:42,690
that's why we're here explore learn

553
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,370
share teach do things that are rewarding

554
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,810
one of the things we found is hey take

555
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,669
on a project remember you used to love

556
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,530
to play with that so everybody's playing

557
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:50,730
with drones now that's cool play with

558
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:52,110
drones do cool stuff with drones

559
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,790
Raspberry Pi has been around for a few

560
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,679
years people are doing more and more you

561
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:57,000
know home automation stuff you're

562
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,670
certainly not going to buy the garbage

563
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,050
that exposes your entire house to every

564
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,970
idiot on the Internet including the

565
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:04,919
people that sold you this stuff so build

566
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,690
your own do stuff that's fun and then

567
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,710
teach somebody else about it and then

568
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,600
they're gonna be like that's cool that

569
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:16,500
dude smart or that woman's brilliant

570
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:17,760
that's fun and I'm going really fast

571
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,990
here that's all right I can always just

572
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:26,520
tell stories so here we go somebody

573
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:29,670
needs a hand right you offer somebody

574
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:33,510
han that's not being a hacker that's

575
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:37,020
being human when we cross into

576
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:39,810
technology and you offer a hand that's

577
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:44,820
arguably a way of looking at being a

578
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:48,870
hacker in my idealistic not fox or CNN

579
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:53,370
news version packard em but you're all

580
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:57,449
like I got spouse I got kids I get

581
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:59,879
mortgage I get like a job and stuff my

582
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,860
old buddy gandhi's that I think said it

583
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,690
best many years ago the problem with

584
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:07,110
altruism is there's really nothing in it

585
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:08,550
for me I think he's also the one that

586
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:14,159
observed that the problem with twitter

587
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:15,690
is attributions a bit sketchy i want to

588
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,280
tell you something about what's in it

589
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:24,540
for you what is in it for you with the

590
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:28,920
altruism I'm a serial volunteer I have

591
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:31,740
volunteered as a shipwright on a ship

592
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:35,430
rigged square rigger volunteered his

593
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,110
crew on that same vessel have done a lot

594
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,910
with beasts I

595
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,919
a lot of other security events I have

596
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:42,920
helped organize and run blacksmith meats

597
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,390
in the Northeast us it's one of many

598
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:48,710
hobbies I don't have time for any more

599
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:50,299
but I play with them served on the

600
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,350
boards or advisory committees for

601
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:53,900
everything from the New England

602
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,480
blacksmith's to Boston user groups which

603
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:59,090
covers everything from little tiny

604
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,920
groups that do basically home user

605
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:03,020
secure you know home user just trying to

606
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,570
make things work forgets securing them

607
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:09,770
to the security to the giant windows

608
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:11,450
server groups and Boston linux unix BL

609
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:14,750
use interesting you know everybody's got

610
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,980
a linux user group b lu meets at MIT

611
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:18,470
that might tell you something there

612
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,179
called boston linux unix because they

613
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:22,760
had to add Linux when that newfangled

614
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:24,470
crap came in that's how long that crowds

615
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,470
been around so I've been involved in all

616
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:30,320
of these things and put a lot of time in

617
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:32,660
it plus I'm make fun of RSA but I'm on a

618
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,668
program committee for RSA they're doing

619
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,679
short-term stuff last minute stuff where

620
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:38,150
you can a couple of months outs have

621
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:42,080
been a talk that gets voted on by the

622
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:43,490
public that was a big change for them

623
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,139
I'm also working with info security

624
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:51,470
Europe on their intelligent defense

625
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:53,480
tracks and in the past few years whole

626
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:55,760
nother series of talks I've done a bunch

627
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,919
of research on stress and burnout and

628
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,200
survival skills inside the hacker

629
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:03,770
community inside info SEC professionals

630
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,720
going into what's happening in DevOps we

631
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:07,668
all have a common set of problems whole

632
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,010
other talk but I want to stress

633
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:11,900
something I did these years i started

634
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,980
this years and years ago i started this

635
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:17,000
when I was making most of my income

636
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:18,169
still from working for consulting for

637
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,450
car dealers trying to keep their

638
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:22,010
networks running and minimize the amount

639
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:24,230
of garbage that was in there you know

640
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:28,400
get hit as many bad get the worst of the

641
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:29,720
bad guys out of their networks but

642
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,220
that's where I could learn right I could

643
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,169
go to these user groups I could go to

644
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:36,080
these things like I couldn't take the

645
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:38,059
time off to spend weeks or months at

646
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,699
John Campbell folks school or one of the

647
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:42,320
blacksmith's schools so I became part of

648
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,480
that group and I volunteered and helped

649
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,740
make it happen and I learned and then I

650
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,580
shared and I helped and it's like I

651
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,389
don't know anything about blacksmithing

652
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,489
I know what

653
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:52,189
room is I know which end I hold I'll

654
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:55,519
clean up after the meet from there I end

655
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:59,079
up welcome in the forges of some of the

656
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:02,119
most talented artists in America I

657
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:05,749
didn't do him to become successful but

658
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:08,418
what I discovered was it was part of the

659
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:10,190
path wasn't my motivation I wasn't

660
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:12,379
networking with people to make

661
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,999
connections to end up in a really

662
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:16,099
awesome job but it happened and that

663
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:18,619
leads me to one of my favorite people to

664
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:20,708
talk about if you've ever seen me speak

665
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:27,668
before I probably talked about this dude

666
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:31,129
Newton look at here and that's awesome

667
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:37,009
so come I'm growing it's good on top of

668
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:40,820
my head now yeah Isaac Newton is

669
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:42,859
famously quoted as saying if I've seen

670
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,079
further it is only by standing on the

671
00:30:42,859 --> 00:30:47,478
shoulders of giants that's actually not

672
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:50,629
an original quote of his somebody that

673
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:52,999
he's whose shoulders he stood on told

674
00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:57,199
him that when he was crediting one of

675
00:30:52,999 --> 00:31:01,159
his mentors or educators but let's think

676
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:05,599
about it this guy changed the way we see

677
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:07,070
the world around us forever if I've done

678
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,658
anything it's because other people got a

679
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,658
head start and I just took it from there

680
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:17,478
that's the kind of attitude builds a

681
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:19,279
community right and let's go ahead and

682
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:21,529
be idealistic Jack one of the things

683
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:25,399
that I will occasionally say about that

684
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:28,969
is the critical thing is not being a

685
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:31,820
giant the critical thing is offering a

686
00:31:28,969 --> 00:31:35,209
shoulder for others when you offer your

687
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:37,249
shoulder to others that's part of what

688
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:42,320
makes you a giant not the other way

689
00:31:37,249 --> 00:31:46,119
around so how we doing man I'm going way

690
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:51,499
fast good thank you I can tell stories

691
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:55,639
this dude also said this there tons of

692
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:59,139
quotes it's kind of a smart dude how we

693
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:59,139
doing do

694
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:06,930
so I'd note about Newton so we're in the

695
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:09,990
process as a raised species whatever of

696
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:13,470
trying to disprove Newtonian physics to

697
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:16,980
move beyond Newtonian physics right who

698
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:20,000
hopes that Newtonian physics hold at our

699
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:22,530
level more than anyone else in the world

700
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,180
the people trying to disprove it because

701
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:25,950
I don't know about you but I hope that

702
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:28,110
the sheer force of nuts-and-bolts

703
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:30,570
actually works if I'm sitting on top of

704
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:32,370
that stupid Large Hadron Collider I want

705
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:34,830
that stuff to stay in there I hope U's

706
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:46,820
right it can go weird under there so

707
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:46,820
anyway we have some weird hobbies Newton

708
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:51,540
besides the the borrowed one my favorite

709
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:54,240
quote of Newton's is this I do not know

710
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:56,399
what I may appear to the world but to

711
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,310
myself I seem to have been only like a

712
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,510
boy playing on the seashore and

713
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:03,990
diverting myself and now and then

714
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:07,500
finding in a smoother pedal pebble or a

715
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:09,720
prettier shell than ordinary whilst the

716
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:14,880
great ocean of truth lay undiscovered

717
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:16,620
before me so playing with drones if you

718
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,300
think that's cool that is cool somebody

719
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,949
else is going to think it's cool Newton

720
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,960
thought he was playing with pebbles so

721
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,250
you know find your pebbles that's one of

722
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,970
the things that this kind of community

723
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:29,220
can help you do and we're going to wrap

724
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:31,110
up really early but here's a new thought

725
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,490
of head recently so if you do these

726
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:35,219
things and you become part of a

727
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:36,990
community and you share what you know

728
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:40,830
you end up in front of a room full of

729
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:45,620
people maybe figuratively maybe

730
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:53,370
literally and in this case literally the

731
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:55,530
spotlight lands on you always carry a

732
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:57,750
little virtual mirror in your head so

733
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:59,250
you can reflect some of that light back

734
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,080
on the people that helped you get there

735
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:04,140
and some of the people that are coming

736
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,699
up behind you that could use some credit

737
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,769
for things that they don't know

738
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,129
there are too many people in the

739
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:14,369
community that just Treadway they may

740
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:16,348
not have the personality they may not be

741
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:17,820
old enough to not care what people think

742
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:20,429
and they may not be comfortable making

743
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,839
an ass out of themselves so they may sit

744
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:24,060
quietly but there are people out there

745
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,710
and that's advanced an age thing the

746
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:28,379
older I get the less I care what people

747
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:31,020
think on some levels and on other levels

748
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:32,759
it's completely the other way around but

749
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,739
so I share that spotlight and there are

750
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,690
too many year I mean obviously it's I'm

751
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:39,618
going to take the easy way out I'll

752
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:43,560
point to Chris again thank you brother

753
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:45,450
use a big part of getting me connected

754
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:54,389
with the broader community the 303

755
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:56,069
community that that's the right gret

756
00:34:54,389 --> 00:35:00,089
grab the duct tape and the garbage bags

757
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:04,109
let's go um yes chris said that to me

758
00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:05,670
and I followed like the second day I met

759
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:09,210
him hey grab the depth take than garbage

760
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:11,490
bags and I did in followed him that may

761
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:14,010
say something to you in there are other

762
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:15,868
folks there people here who are in the

763
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:20,130
process or trying to join the

764
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:22,589
information security world befriend them

765
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:26,099
helped them forward their people on that

766
00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:28,859
path this week I am thinking a lot about

767
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:30,180
my friend Leslie carhartt if you're on

768
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:35,060
Twitter you may know her as hacks for

769
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:37,618
pancakes she is an awesome young woman

770
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:43,130

771
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:46,859
ninja martial artist geek nerd just

772
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:49,910
wonderful and she shares if people ask

773
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:54,109
for help she does whatever she can and

774
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:56,009
so I just I just adore and admire Leslie

775
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:57,480
unfortunately this week she's suffering

776
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:59,880
having lost her mother to cancer this

777
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,099
week but we have friends that you know

778
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,869
could use a use something remember we're

779
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:07,050
all people we get all wound up right you

780
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:08,880
know my god ah the sock monkeys called

781
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:13,560
screaming about something like well

782
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:16,530
teach them how to tune an IDs but share

783
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,140
that and I could go on but you know what

784
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:22,369
i think maybe we'll

785
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:24,109
we'll wrap it up with this thought this

786
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:25,640
is not the end it's the end of my talk

787
00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:27,828
but it's the beginning of this

788
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:31,700
conference it's the beginning of

789
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:34,220
security b-sides and Calgary and pulling

790
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,828
people together in this area and with

791
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:41,269
that I'm going to end a bit early and

792
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:44,230
let you guys brace for the next round

793
00:36:41,269 --> 00:36:44,229
thank you all

794

good well thank you jack that was a

795
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,140
great presentation and great

796
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,570
introduction to be sides here for

797
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:19,859
Calgary if there any questions from the

798
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:24,810
audience here no too early my beard

799
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:26,520
leagues its own life it has its own

800
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:35,670
Twitter account which i don't actually

801
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:37,790
control that's that's true so I so need

802
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,990
the little faint little game we play

803
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:43,410
older or younger than Jack's beard

804
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:46,109
December of 1979's last time I shaved I

805
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:48,930
only did that because I was in a rental

806
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:50,990
and the stove pilot kept going out and

807
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:53,700
one day I through the stove door open

808
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:55,109
and it lit from and the only way I could

809
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,370
get the smell of burnt hair out of my

810
00:37:55,110 --> 00:38:00,090
face is that so otherwise it would have

811
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:01,770
been like 16 months older and so it just

812
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:04,410
leads its life and it you know it feeds

813
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:06,870
off of whatever mrs. my mouth when I try

814
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:09,720
to eat and drink and as you can tell I

815
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:11,759
miss a lot because it's well fed and the

816
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,890
one thing is I don't know what what the

817
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,930
regional equivalent or maybe if they're

818
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:17,040
here tractor supply or general tractor

819
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:20,370
or wherever you get your equestrian

820
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:24,410
supplies go into the equestrian section

821
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:27,029
and they have cowboy magic shampoo

822
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:29,940
cowboy magic conditioner and then they

823
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:34,080
have cowboy magic detangler and the

824
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:37,230
detangler is magical it's just magical

825
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:39,960
makes sign and glow and detangle and

826
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:41,310
it's just it's and it makes people

827
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,960
fondle your beard when you're walking

828
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:46,650
around in Vegas which is really weird

829
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,540
but the you know it's I I am I've been

830
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:51,480
married over 36 years and I am a very

831
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,830
faithful husband my beard objects to

832
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,430
that at times when we're in Vegas

833
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,430
together but

834
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:16,640
here we go again a the Mohawk would be

835
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:17,869
kind of sad at this point oh yeah when

836
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,259
it gets bad enough I will do the

837
00:39:17,869 --> 00:39:27,260
comb-over I mean I can't look worse than

838
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:41,539
that thing on Trump's head all right any

839
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:45,440
other questions yes sir so what's the

840
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:48,410
same and what's different and one of the

841
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,510
things that's different that as an

842
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:52,399
organizer I see a lot is the de role of

843
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:56,210
sponsors and the engagement level of

844
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:59,390
sponsors Germans don't like sponsors in

845
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:01,670
their face and so they have a very

846
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:03,680
subtle role and unfortunately means the

847
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,579
sponsors aren't is involved unless they

848
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,950
have people at are really part of

849
00:40:04,579 --> 00:40:11,569
community other places in Asia for

850
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,980
example sponsors need to be a very

851
00:40:11,569 --> 00:40:15,319
prominent part of it or people don't

852
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:17,660
take it seriously because I'm making

853
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:19,759
huge sweeping generalizations as far as

854
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,710
the community some places have a more

855
00:40:19,759 --> 00:40:24,259
cohesive sense of community when we move

856
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:27,980
when we have an event there other places

857
00:40:24,259 --> 00:40:31,460
don't have a sense of community and they

858
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:34,609
often build one not always I'd like to

859
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:35,480
be idealistic and says you know tomorrow

860
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:37,609
night we're all going to get together

861
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,720
and sing Kumbaya and we're going to it

862
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:40,160
doesn't work that way but there are

863
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,859
places where it is made a profound

864
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,180
difference and it depends on one of the

865
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:46,009
things one of the things is a void there

866
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,598
are places where the b-sides are you

867
00:40:46,009 --> 00:40:49,730
know they do okay but they have a

868
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,410
healthy community and it's just another

869
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:54,529
piece of it other places where there

870
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:56,808
isn't a strong sense of community it

871
00:40:54,529 --> 00:41:00,030
brings people out where they wouldn't

872
00:40:56,809 --> 00:41:03,090
normally get the sort of unfiltered and

873
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:06,200
an honest conversation a couple of

874
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:09,780
things that come to mind are warsaw and

875
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:13,950
algiers college students put those on

876
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:15,000
and they thought it was great they did

877
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,919
it for a couple of years and graduated

878
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,360
and went into consulting practice and

879
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,820
brought more college students in and so

880
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:23,330
now the you know the local security

881
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:27,450
community has this pipeline from

882
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:29,810
university to the industry based on the

883
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:32,730
community they've built Michigan was

884
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:33,779
ripe for a catalyst Doug song got up and

885
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:35,850
says how come we're I'll have it the

886
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,560
first b-sides Detroit why are we all in

887
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:39,690
this room together we don't know each

888
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,549
other like I know you you know him but

889
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:44,040
why don't why don't we know each other

890
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:46,260
and at night they set an IRC channel

891
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:49,710
they started connecting and the whole

892
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:52,080
Michigan security my sec thing that was

893
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:54,300
one of the sparks that catalyzed that

894
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:57,569
and so it depends on whether there's a

895
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,520
big sense of community and they tend to

896
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:00,930
reflect the local community the one in

897
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,460
Austin tends to be a little weird

898
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:04,980
although now they've grown to where they

899
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:07,920
have to be more structured the first few

900
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,750
years we the after party was on a duck

901
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,300
tour except was a duck tour that had

902
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:18,540
unlimited alcohol flowing and live music

903
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:21,390
because it's austin right san francisco

904
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:23,670
is up against RSA there's a lot more

905
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:25,620
developers spin there because people are

906
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:29,610
writing software right everybody at

907
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:32,040
starbucks or peets or heaven forbid blue

908
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:36,510
bottle is is a CEO of at least two

909
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:37,980
companies right you know but when they

910
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:41,370
work well it's because people connect

911
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:57,120
and share you know that's that's that it

912
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:59,009
was know that yes yep so one of the

913
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,330
people that doesn't get as much credit

914
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,680
as she deserves and I should have

915
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:03,060
mentioned earlier so thank you for that

916
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,399
because it's going to remind me to say

917
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:07,200
Michelle clinger is the person who stays

918
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,270
on top of events around the world she

919
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,029
talks to most of the new organizers

920
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:13,038
coaches them I pick up the slack on a

921
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:15,049
lot of those depending

922
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:20,390
where we are since they are global time

923
00:43:15,049 --> 00:43:21,650
zones and whatever also who they are but

924
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:24,259
she picks up most of that the other

925
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:29,299
thing that Michelle and I do is we deal

926
00:43:24,259 --> 00:43:36,109
with events that have opportunities for

927
00:43:29,299 --> 00:43:40,219
improvement overly commercial events for

928
00:43:36,109 --> 00:43:41,749
the sponsors or vendors is a danger and

929
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:44,479
it really is based on community

930
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:47,839
sensibilities and we will you know have

931
00:43:44,479 --> 00:43:51,618
a conversation about it I won't name uni

932
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:55,130
but there was one last fall that people

933
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:57,499
thought was overly commercialized in

934
00:43:55,130 --> 00:44:00,769
defense of them what happened is they

935
00:43:57,499 --> 00:44:04,160
came up short on sponsorship so the guy

936
00:44:00,769 --> 00:44:07,910
who was lead organizer convinced his

937
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,868
company to fill in all the holes and so

938
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:13,788
that company was overly well represented

939
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:16,039
and so it was legitimate complaint they

940
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:18,259
had a rational reason and he was the

941
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:19,609
organizer was as frustrated by that once

942
00:44:18,259 --> 00:44:25,939
we got in a conversation with him as

943
00:44:19,609 --> 00:44:28,719
others yeah and then we get into the

944
00:44:25,939 --> 00:44:32,629
really ugly stuff which is the session

945
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:35,479
when b-sides grow you know people change

946
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:37,159
jobs in this industry we move people do

947
00:44:35,479 --> 00:44:38,479
things you know ridiculous things like

948
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:43,009
get married and have kids and get

949
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:44,598
divorced and have pets and buy

950
00:44:43,009 --> 00:44:46,819
motorcycles and decide they're on the

951
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:48,709
wrong side of the continent or you know

952
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:51,130
heaven forbid buy a boat and decide that

953
00:44:48,709 --> 00:44:55,489
it's moored in the wrong ocean whatever

954
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:57,499
and if there isn't some thought into how

955
00:44:55,489 --> 00:45:00,199
you take a b-sides and this applies to

956
00:44:57,499 --> 00:45:02,598
anything okay if there isn't some

957
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:04,699
thought into succession there isn't some

958
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:07,909
thought into how your kids are going to

959
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:11,390
inherit your house it gets ugly and

960
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:13,789
actually the worst event problems we've

961
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:16,939
added then and people trying to take

962
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:19,849
over try to hand off and when we get

963
00:45:16,939 --> 00:45:21,140
conflicts over you know territorial

964
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:24,559
conflicts

965
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:25,759
usually in a secession case in Michelle

966
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:27,140
and I and sometimes some of the others

967
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,559
on the board get involved and that's

968
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:32,509
that's my role and I try to be

969
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:35,269
conciliatory and I try to be calm and

970
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:37,849
use the perspective of being you know

971
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:40,189
having been a dad for 35 years and doing

972
00:45:37,849 --> 00:45:42,890
these things and having some perspective

973
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:44,059
on life and I will admit there are times

974
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:45,410
when I just want to grab people by the

975
00:45:44,059 --> 00:45:47,059
head and smash their heads together like

976
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:49,640
coconuts so I can hear that rattle but I

977
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:52,819
don't actually do that so that's the and

978
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:56,328
it's thankfully rare but the things do

979
00:45:52,819 --> 00:46:04,450
happen I mean we're talking about 251

980
00:45:56,329 --> 00:46:04,450
events around the world I you went there

981
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:10,609
yes oh yes oh for those that don't know

982
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:13,848
originally there were three of us who

983
00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:16,220
sort of were floating around the core of

984
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:20,269
the b-sides thing once we realized it

985
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:24,640
wasn't just one event and it was it was

986
00:46:20,269 --> 00:46:28,519
Chris and myself and Mike Don and we all

987
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:30,529
have different views of the world and

988
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:31,729
the cool thing about that was when we

989
00:46:30,529 --> 00:46:33,170
agreed it was cool because if you

990
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:35,059
convinced the three of us assholes that

991
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:39,019
you were on the right path quick okay

992
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:40,670
right right and I and Chris it's like if

993
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:42,319
you think it's okay i think it's okay

994
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:45,559
and he thinks it's okay it's probably ok

995
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:47,900
but don't people go in different

996
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:53,240
directions and so we had some

997
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:55,759
frustrations and it they were legitimate

998
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:58,910
frustrations over how we handle finance

999
00:46:55,759 --> 00:47:01,490
/ how we handled promotion and it is why

1000
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:03,740
besides global is a small organization

1001
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:05,288
now instead of a large organization

1002
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:08,598
which runs events besides global

1003
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:11,809
basically does mentorship and and brand

1004
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:13,369
management including recently doing

1005
00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:15,980
trademark and that's what we do because

1006
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:17,569
the decision was made by uh by some of

1007
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:20,750
us directly and by the community at

1008
00:47:17,569 --> 00:47:23,720
large we don't want the global org to

1009
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:25,910
run Vegas and San Francisco and be part

1010
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,439
of run in Austin and whatever because

1011
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:29,450
then we're competing with with the

1012
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,480
parent body and so what happens is

1013
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:34,049
b-side San Francisco if they run surplus

1014
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,080
little money rolls over

1015
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:39,720
pay the hosting bills and accountant

1016
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:42,720
bills for b-sides global so we had we

1017
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:45,750
had that one and that took a lot and we

1018
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:49,140
were all unhappy with each other at some

1019
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:51,300
level and some of us knew that we were

1020
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,770
unhappy but agree it completely

1021
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:56,040
understood why the other one felt the

1022
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:59,250
way they did and some of us are still

1023
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:06,900
friends and some are not but that's life

1024
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:08,130
you know worry they all worked great

1025
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,600
great and they're a couple of events

1026
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:10,590
that spun off because I didn't want you

1027
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,600
know they they thought the name was

1028
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:13,800
going to melt down and so there's some

1029
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,660
events that I think are great events

1030
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,550
cactus con just coming up really soon in

1031

1032
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:24,060
