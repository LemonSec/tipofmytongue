1
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:09,010
so welcome Steve masters or I used to

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,480
call him snuffleupagus because every

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,459
meeting that I ever had scheduled with

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,350
him he never was there so I actually

5
00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:17,289
didn't believe that he existed so I'm

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:20,410
glad that he actually does so in

7
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:23,290
addition to his instructing at sans

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:25,030
and especially in the areas of ICS I'm

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,759
very curious what we're gonna hear about

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,289
the mousetrap because I keep telling

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,529
clients and story for the vendors in the

12
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:34,440
room stop buying stuff let's make use of

13
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:44,440
what we already have in place so welcome

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:47,019
big warm welcome so I I know a lot of

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,680
the people in the room but I've done a

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:53,170
lot of stuff in security and so on I was

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,969
a developer for seven or so years so I

18
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,370
got to learn operating systems and

19
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:59,469
networks and then somehow I stumbled

20
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,399
into this security thing and I've been

21
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:05,140
doing that ever since

22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:08,619
so I've led security teams and I've more

23
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,810
recently moved to ion so simultaneously

24
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:15,549
we sell stuff and I'm going to tell you

25
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:19,119
to stop buying stuff take that for what

26
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:21,459
it's worth and spend a lot of my time

27
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,609
these days doing assessments pen testing

28
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:29,560
that kind of thing I teach for sands in

29
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:33,130
that same area so I've seen the inside

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:36,849
of a lot of companies lived a lot of

31
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:40,149
interesting projects shall we say in the

32
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:43,170
industry and I've come to the

33
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:45,700
realization lately that we've been

34
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,700
seduced by the vendors and bought an

35
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,429
awful lot of cool toys and forgotten how

36
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:55,209
to do security so that's kind of what

37
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:57,639
I'm gonna talk to you today so will this

38
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:59,880
play know what don't you play this from

39
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:59,880
here

40
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:08,500
it's not playing so we don't need to

41
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:11,200
worry about that there it goes so this

42
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:15,730
is the Tom and Jerry mousetrap just to

43
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,459
reinforce the fact that we don't need to

44
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,709
go to these lengths to capture at least

45
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:22,030
most of the mice right let's let's start

46
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:24,540
with some ones that are just sitting

47
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:29,440
there eating the cheese we don't need to

48
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:32,530
go to these lengths to get the

49
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,550
low-hanging fruit or we seem to if you

50
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:40,060
look at this next one this is more along

51
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:43,000
the lines of what I see us trying to do

52
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:46,480
for security these days so there are a

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,700
few points of failure or potential

54
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,200
points of failure in this process and

55
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,079
you know who can tell me how all of

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,369
those things work what they're all doing

57
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:02,950
how to fix them if they break which one

58
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:04,390
broke etc etc so all it's not that long

59
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,708
a video so I'll let it run all the way

60
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:11,619
through to the end but it gets kind of

61
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:13,120
old at the end but this is what we this

62
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:17,170
is how we do security right we've got

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,480
all of these tools multiple instances of

64
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,589
the same tool all hopefully

65
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:27,130
interoperating together until eventually

66
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:32,890
if all of it goes well we will get to

67
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:35,100
that Mouse I think we're close now yeah

68
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,100
exactly

69
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,510
well sorry got to do another lap

70
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,940
we're almost there

71
00:03:51,930 --> 00:04:01,150
so and then we win right then what

72
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:06,869
happens then the mice learn some new

73
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:06,870
tricks and we are back to square one so

74
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,720
how much how many security tools do you

75
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:16,840
have what what kind of what can I sell

76
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,548
you today I forgot how many there are up

77
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,909
there I think there's 32 things that I

78
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:23,919
managed to come up with up there I mean

79
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,570
who has at least half of the things on

80
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:34,120
this slide somewhere in their

81
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:36,040
environment so now memorize this so your

82
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,050
operational security team show of hands

83
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,110
who has zero to two people on their

84
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,820
security team yeah there's there's a

85
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:47,910
fair number who's lucky enough to have

86
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:51,040
three to four a few more five to six

87
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:53,530
yeah one or two hands seven to eight

88
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,550
anything bigger so we've got yeah we're

89
00:04:53,530 --> 00:05:00,159
down to one hand there are 32 tools here

90
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,900
do the math how many things does each

91
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,810
person on your team need to be

92
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:08,979
proficient or at least sort of kind of

93
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:11,860
competent in and what I see is this

94
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:14,200
means we do nothing well the it just

95
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:20,860
you've got all this stuff and it's doing

96
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:22,510
things and none of it is useful so I'm

97
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,600
gonna start I'm gonna set the table a

98
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,159
little bit at the high level and then

99
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,070
I'll dig into some of the more technical

100
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:34,090
details in terms of what I think you

101
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:36,880
should be doing anyways I've I spent you

102
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,590
know 15 years in oil and gas so

103
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,650
simultaneously trying to provide

104
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,440
security and usability right keep

105
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,330
customers happy

106
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,919
you've been convinced that this product

107
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,229
is going to solve all of your ills

108
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,659
whether that's the usability ills or the

109
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:53,500
security ills but is that the right

110
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:58,180
thing

111
00:05:53,500 --> 00:06:00,060
so requirements who actually figures out

112
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,590
what they need before they buy it and

113
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,560
did you talk to the right people to do

114
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:08,500
that do you have the right requirements

115
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,870
who did you talk to do they have a clue

116
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:15,010
what they're talking about and and who

117
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:17,890
did you missed miss and and now okay

118
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:21,490
I'll I'm I love toys as much as the next

119
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:23,890
guy and in today's world sometimes it

120
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:27,510
makes sense device by the magic bullet

121
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:30,940
I'm not gonna say next-gen firewall wait

122
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,409
but sometimes that makes sense you know

123
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,750
what if I can do everything in one box

124
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,400
there's a lot less management load lot

125
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,160
less configuration upgrade support

126
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,810
maintenance all those things right but

127
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,380
if I'm not gonna use all of those

128
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:47,470
features those no longer become reasons

129
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:49,930
to implement and buy solutions so where

130
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:55,300
can I spend my money and actually get

131
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:56,740
some value from it so we start you know

132
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,040
architecture and design that's where we

133
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:02,110
start all of our projects right so dear

134
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,090
architects actually I hope there's not

135
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,570
too many architects in there actually

136
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,919
understand the technology landscape how

137
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,590
about the existing environment do they

138
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:14,109
know how you operate you know Gartner

139
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,669
says it's good so it is right it's the

140
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,130
best thing but does that fit with the

141
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:22,419
way my guys need to go and operate this

142
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:24,219
environment if it doesn't interoperate

143
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:26,280
or integrate with with all of the other

144
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:30,640
things that we are doing or if we don't

145
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:34,119
I see strategic thinking in different

146
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,650
ways there's yes this is the wave of the

147
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,260
future cloud right that's the wave of

148
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,780
the future but at the same time if I

149
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:43,840
don't have a strategy in place for my

150
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,340
company to get there and to take all of

151
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,289
these legacy things that are still gonna

152
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,229
be sitting around and I still need to

153
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:52,360
make work and use and manage and

154
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:53,469
integrate that with this hybrid

155
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,560
environment that's going to be around

156
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,850
for years and years then that that

157
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,430
newfangled thing isn't gonna give me any

158
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:03,310
benefit for the next decade until I get

159
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:06,370
rid of all of the old stuff so can i

160
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,960
interoperate can I manage do I get the

161
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:12,070
ability logging the monitoring the

162
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,810
reporting can it scale yes that Swiss

163
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:17,710
Army knife does everything so at what

164
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:20,440
scale and of course we're seeing things

165
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:23,859
move so fast today I was just saying

166
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:27,070
there are 52 vendors in the endpoint

167
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:29,110
security space so my advice to you would

168
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,820
be but think short term until they

169
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:34,450
figure out how to get that number down

170
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:36,909
below 20 at least because you know I

171
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:38,409
would say more than half of those guys

172
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,630
aren't gonna be around in a few years or

173
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:42,580
the products won't be anyways so think

174
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:46,890
think are we talking about the next year

175
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:48,610
the next 2 years 3 5 10 on down the line

176
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:54,069
project managers I'm gonna insult

177
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:59,589
everybody equally today I think so I'm

178
00:08:54,070 --> 00:09:01,390
sure I've seen a much greater level of

179
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:04,540
dependence and reliance on project

180
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:07,240
management over the last say five and 10

181
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,800
years as opposed to before that time and

182
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,990
I've seen all kinds of project managers

183
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,870
some of them think they're architects

184
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:16,660
some of them think they're techies so

185
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,730
but I know the one thing they have two

186
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:23,550
things they all care about three maybe

187
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:27,100
scope budget time do any of those things

188
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:30,490
bear at all on what you are trying to

189
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,620
accomplish in your security practice do

190
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,690
you care about scope budget in time well

191
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,130
I mean if your manager or you have to

192
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,010
pay for your project sure you care about

193
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:40,720
some of those things but that's what a

194
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,520
project management manager cares about

195
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,080
so should they be the ones deciding how

196
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,220
you are while a what tools you're

197
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,260
getting in the first place and how

198
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:53,650
you're implementing them and then so we

199
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:55,300
need to and and and a project manager

200
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:58,000
wants their project to continue right so

201
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,040
they're gonna try and scope it such that

202
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,130
they can get it done within their budget

203
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:06,520
but you probably aren't going to be

204
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:08,320
successful in actually doing a what I

205
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,370
see is you've got a project manager that

206
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,740
says I've got this budget these

207
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:16,240
resources this timeframe we are going to

208
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:18,550
to have this running by a June 30th but

209
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,410
if you want to do a good job of it you

210
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,479
need to do some planning

211
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,490
beforehand and actually figure out how

212
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,200
you can implement this in a manner

213
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:29,740
that's going to be usable after June

214
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:32,980
30th and those two things are usually on

215
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,480
opposite ends of the spectrum I can't do

216
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,340
a good job of implementing if I need to

217
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,260
be done by June 30th so then I end up

218
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:40,480
with something well it's in I checked

219
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:43,090
the box and it's not doing what I want

220
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,500
it or need it to do and then you have

221
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:46,180
the project resources who aren't really

222
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,160
project resources I'm sure we've all

223
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,560
been there we've got the business

224
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,890
drivers versus the security versus the

225
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:58,719
usability and everyone's got realistic

226
00:10:53,890 --> 00:11:00,880
project deadlines right ya know so

227
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,930
that's this is what we end up with next

228
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,640
next next next yeah I'm done wait my

229
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:11,079
hands do that it says I'm done right

230
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:13,060
it's complete wait lights are blinking

231
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,930
nobody's phoning me to say stuff isn't

232
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:19,660
working I can see the internet when

233
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,489
we're good right that's that's what a

234
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,829
lot of the implementations look like I

235
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:27,220
see these days so let's get vendor

236
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:29,760
professional services in to help us what

237
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,770
do they know if you're lucky they know

238
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,260
vendors and they know your product or

239
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,770
their product but do they know how you

240
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,790
operate

241
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,170
do they know enough about your

242
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,839
environment have they asked you any

243
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:43,510
questions about what you're trying to

244
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,590
accomplish or how you work what other

245
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,850
tools you have what they need to

246
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,050
integrate with or are they coming in

247
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,630
with their playbook and they're just

248
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:51,069
gonna check off all the boxes do all the

249
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:54,790
template configuration and walk away

250
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:56,170
I know so this is predicated on you

251
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,520
having requirements in the first place

252
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,599
but do they know what your requirements

253
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:03,460
are and and yeah I mean forbid do you

254
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,800
share a common understanding of security

255
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,530
because there are a lot of vendors that

256
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,959
touch the security space that are not

257
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,790
selling security products and they are

258
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,610
much more focused on whether their

259
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:18,370
products work are usable and so on and

260
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:22,060
of course vendor professional services

261
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:24,880
is expensive so were they given enough

262
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:29,439
time on budget to actually do a decent

263
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,570
job and then we get to everyone's

264
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,270
favorite documentation and knowledge

265
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,240
transfer

266
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:37,310
well again it's in the lights came on no

267
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,310
one came running screaming that's what

268
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:42,619
we need to do right did you budget

269
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:44,149
enough for the vendor to tell you what

270
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:48,890
they did and show you how to do it

271
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:52,130
yourself and so the vendor tells you

272
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:54,199
it's working do your two guys on your

273
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:57,110
security team supporting 32 different

274
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:00,230
types of technologies do they know

275
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:03,740
enough to even figure out whether it's

276
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:05,540
working and when three months down the

277
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,820
road have they done anything to make

278
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,520
sure it continues working or is updated

279
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:13,000
or patched or whatever are you afraid to

280
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:18,589
touch it do you have something that was

281
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:22,459
went out of support in 2010 1999 seen

282
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:24,770
both so I'll just do this in-house like

283
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:26,899
I said next next next finish I know my

284
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,370
environment I know what I need I know my

285
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:32,330
requirements because I actually did have

286
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:35,060
them so yeah that that light came on

287
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:38,690
it's working I'm good my the easiest

288
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:41,060
example I give for this is storage I

289
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,800
bought a brand new sand switch or my

290
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,770
storage team bought a brand new sand

291
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,579
switch they plugged it in it works

292
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:51,880
lights are on they could see a LUN

293
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:55,520
that's right there's there's no other

294
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:57,110
potential configuration issues that

295
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,910
might arise there's no risk to just

296
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,170
plugging something in default

297
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,779
credentials leaving it on the network

298
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:05,649
with holding storage for pretty much

299
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:09,230
everything in your environment is there

300
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:10,850
and of course Fred and my daughter

301
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:14,180
watched The Flintstones for the first

302
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,620
time she's nine but she and never

303
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,569
stumbled across the Flintstones we were

304
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,100
trying to explain that this is what we

305
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:22,930
watched while we were growing up but it

306
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,930
wasn't like this but

307
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:28,579
so you know Fred the expert and I'm not

308
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,500
quite sure what made me think of Fred as

309
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,570
an expert at anything but was busy

310
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,540
fighting fires so Barney the intern did

311
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:38,180
the install right because you're your

312
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:41,300
tech leads are too valuable to to put in

313
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,380
a room with a with a vendor for however

314
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:47,689
many days it takes to implement

315
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:51,890
something right so then you get into the

316
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:53,950
well it works as long as you disable

317
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,269
that you don't break my application and

318
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:58,610
you need to disable that in your

319
00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:02,540
security product because my application

320
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:04,220
does crazy things and you break it I'm

321
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,160
not gonna fix my app I'm gonna just

322
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,250
disable your functionality so it works

323
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:14,899
right I enabled it it broke a critical

324
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:17,060
app and you know we don't have anybody

325
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:18,140
who knows how that app works it just

326
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,550
works right you're not gonna

327
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,779
troubleshoot god I'm not gonna help you

328
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:24,109
troubleshoot that we don't even know how

329
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:25,880
to log into that server so it's a

330
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:31,490
problem with the security product right

331
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:33,770
let's just neuter it so I need to many

332
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:37,670
approvals these are just I've seen and

333
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:40,220
heard all the excuses the business needs

334
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,560
to approve and the you know whatever

335
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,450
governance folks and the CIO and my

336
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,790
manager and nobody wants to be that

337
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:49,700
person that says actually push the

338
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,410
button and do it let's turn on this

339
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:54,110
awesome feature that gives me all the

340
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:56,149
security in the world but there's a

341
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:58,160
point five percent chance that the

342
00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:00,350
internet might go down for a few minutes

343
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,390
while that's too much risk alright no

344
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,310
one's gonna sign off on that that's the

345
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:06,199
risk to benefit to implement and of

346
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:09,229
course security has no benefit right I'm

347
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:11,120
not a target I don't you know park my

348
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:14,390
car on the street no one's gonna come

349
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,870
and pull on my door handles or I got to

350
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:20,000
take an outage well is that whatever

351
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,740
that thing is that needs an outage is it

352
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,310
redundant well then you don't care about

353
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:28,760
outages we don't know how to do that we

354
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:31,160
have no process nobody you know I need

355
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,630
help from you to do that but you don't

356
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,000
know how to help me do it I guess we

357
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:36,130
can't do it and of course

358
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,540
I'm not getting paid for that that's

359
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:40,340
we're never gonna do it in that case or

360
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,870
we've got other priorities it takes too

361
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,370
much time my project deadlines the end

362
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:48,680
of the month whatever it is okay

363
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:51,710
there's a ton of excuses now let's see

364
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:54,170
we got it installed whatever it is it's

365
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,450
in there it's operating all the security

366
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,579
lights are blinking so who's managing

367
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,580
that day-to-day well of course it's

368
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,890
Barney cuz we're not gonna pay someone

369
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:08,329
you know Fred the experienced man a tour

370
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:09,920
operator installer two to run not

371
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:13,698
hearings wait too much money to sit in

372
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:17,660
front of a console and tune manage

373
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:19,430
monitor and you know was a team of two I

374
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:23,689
guess everybody has to know everything

375
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:25,339
anyways but you got to be on call how

376
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:28,120
many people in this room are on call or

377
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:31,310
have teams on call right there's a lot

378
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,590
so can you operate all 32 of those

379
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:37,280
technologies at 2:00 in the morning

380
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:38,540
without your cup of coffee so how many

381
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,970
tools or products does everyone have to

382
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:45,320
know well 32 divided by 2 that's at

383
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:47,870
least 16 and can any one of those people

384
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,350
achieve an expert level understanding in

385
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:56,750
whatever that critical security tool is

386
00:17:50,350 --> 00:18:00,500
can everyone probably not and so I don't

387
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:02,990
know who has time to actually keep track

388
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,820
keep tabs on the products that they're

389
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:07,400
installing or that they were operating

390
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,899
sorry what what are the new features you

391
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,490
know there's there's a new version of

392
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,470
whatever came out today

393
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,810
does it have useful features will you

394
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:17,450
ever look at those will you ever upgrade

395
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:21,620
will you ever turn those on have the

396
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:23,060
best practices changed is there you know

397
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,290
a new capability with the new best

398
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,550
practice that would solve all your

399
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,620
problems do you have time to look at

400
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:30,500
that figure that all out and of course

401
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:35,649
who's watching vlogs and alerts and and

402
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:39,290
figuring out when stuff is broken so

403
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:41,870
perfect security that's what we want

404
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:43,960
right everything you know the the I

405
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:48,080
didn't put it in here the the Dilbert

406
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,650
cartoon right in order to login you must

407
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,649
stare too

408
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:53,690
directly at the Sun that way we can be

409
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:56,930
secured right where I'm gonna disable

410
00:18:53,690 --> 00:19:00,380
security we're not gonna get there

411
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:01,850
you'll never get there and and it's a

412
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,350
it's an admirable goal it's something

413
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:07,699
that should be in your sights in your

414
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:10,750
plans but you're never gonna get there

415
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,200
let's it's like I've had this discussion

416
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,140
multiple times

417
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:18,740
well data exfiltration this is a bit of

418
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:21,380
a tangent but people are bringing data

419
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:24,110
in and out on USB keys so let's glue all

420
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,000
the USB ports shut oh but then they can

421
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,360
connect Gmail and transfer data that way

422
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,250
so let's block Gmail and then they can

423
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:34,580
burn it to DVD or they can just bring in

424
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:37,310
their laptop or or or and so you get the

425
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,710
people that say well they're gonna find

426
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:45,340
a way I'm I give up I'm not gonna bother

427
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:45,340
right there's so many different ways to

428
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:52,550
suck at security or to bypass security

429
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,990
I'm just gonna give up I'm not gonna

430
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,490
bother well if you never start you're

431
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,890
never gonna get there so let's forget

432
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:00,620
about these Dilek goals of perfect

433
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:03,140
security and let's see if we can get

434
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:07,070
most of the way there with relatively

435
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:09,380
little cost little effort you know a

436
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:12,379
well implemented solution providing 80%

437
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:15,560
benefit at 20% of the cost is way

438
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:18,140
superior than something that might get

439
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,550
you all the way to 100% if only you

440
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,440
could do it if only you could get it

441
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,190
working and support it and it was still

442
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,490
working tomorrow

443
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:29,930
all right let's let's start with what we

444
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:32,300
can do so you know that's that's kind of

445
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:33,950
a the landscape of the problems I could

446
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:37,220
talk for a long time just about those

447
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:41,990
but that's not really why I'm here what

448
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:44,540
can we do well I've got one one hint it

449
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:47,630
doesn't come in shrink-wrap of any sort

450
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:51,770
or cardboard box none of those things it

451
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:54,020
doesn't come in a big brown truck let's

452
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:57,320
do more with less who in this room is

453
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,918
doing more with less these days or less

454
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:04,259
with less or some

455
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:05,940
you know take your pick so let's let's

456
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:07,139
focus on how we can do that because we

457
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,039
certainly don't have the money to go buy

458
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:12,600
all these tools anyways

459
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:15,389
let's understand what capabilities we

460
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:18,330
have and actually leverage them because

461
00:21:15,389 --> 00:21:20,850
there's a lot of cool features that you

462
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:22,168
may not be aware that you have or you

463
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,668
may be aware but you just haven't given

464
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:25,340
any thought to them or you don't

465
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:27,809
understand the value that they bring

466
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:31,939
let's actually apply best practices how

467
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:34,559
about starting there you know operate

468
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,720
support maintain don't just keep firing

469
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,629
in - laughter - laughter tool with

470
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,869
blinky lights that that you know look

471
00:21:39,629 --> 00:21:44,879
cool right how about we upgrade

472
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:46,049
occasionally you know that goes along

473
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:48,238
with patching and all of those other

474
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:50,158
things and take advantage of those new

475
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:52,950
features like these vendors are at each

476
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,629
other's throats they are it's a

477
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,129
cutthroat business they want their

478
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:58,559
market share they are implementing new

479
00:21:56,129 --> 00:22:00,238
capabilities new features let's actually

480
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,769
see if we can take advantage of them

481
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:04,549
because they're they're doing a pretty

482
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:09,869
good job of bringing out new

483
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:12,899
capabilities so use them so really like

484
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:14,970
this is not rocket science but I don't

485
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:17,820
see it done or a lot of these things

486
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:20,399
done a lot and I'm sure you you've heard

487
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:23,970
all of the the various red team pen

488
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:27,768
testing talks I mean yes there are talks

489
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:30,600
if you hunt around on red team failures

490
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:33,960
but you know and they are spectacular

491
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:36,748
sometimes but they don't happen nearly

492
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:41,850
as often as the successes from the red

493
00:22:36,749 --> 00:22:44,879
team perspective right so you should

494
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:47,580
know your environment it's the age

495
00:22:44,879 --> 00:22:50,340
age-old adage right who can who can

496
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:52,139
produce today without having to sit down

497
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:55,499
at a white board or standard white board

498
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:58,850
a an accurate diagram of their network

499
00:22:55,499 --> 00:23:01,350
their environment without drawing it now

500
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:04,498
so what are you protecting you know

501
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:06,209
we've all heard the stories right enable

502
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:08,129
all those features follow the best

503
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:10,360
practices they are called best practices

504
00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:12,908
for a reason

505
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,139
I get into arguments with my wife all

506
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:18,279
the time about this she's like well

507
00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:22,049
that's just your view that's that's the

508
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:24,309
hedge among the hegemonies view the

509
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:25,480
established the establishments view of

510
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:27,220
what's the best practice but we got to

511
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,330
start somewhere right until someone

512
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,700
comes up with something better that's

513
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:35,980
our best practice so let's actually

514
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:37,779
follow those egress filtering who blocks

515
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:42,129
outbound access to the Internet by

516
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:45,340
default in their company that is a scary

517
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:48,490
small number of hands talking about the

518
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:51,490
8020 rule don't do anything else I'm and

519
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:54,009
I can't say that you know universally

520
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,419
but don't do anything else until you can

521
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:58,330
control what goes out of your

522
00:23:55,419 --> 00:24:00,279
environment and then is it on here well

523
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:06,220
that SSL interception comes along with

524
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:09,190
that I will talk about that if you where

525
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:10,929
is that we started I don't know we woke

526
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:12,909
up one morning and we blocked outbound

527
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:16,090
access by default I can't remember it

528
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:17,950
was a long time ago but we had a an

529
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:20,320
environment where you could not get to

530
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:23,110
the Internet except through approved

531
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,879
methods through proxies and the rest is

532
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:28,889
blocked so then along comes the

533
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:33,490
sandboxing vendor take your pick and

534
00:24:28,889 --> 00:24:34,990
what we would see is we would see stage

535
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,059
or stager stators stage is getting

536
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,250
dropped right malware trying to execute

537
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:41,019
and nothing would happen because it

538
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:43,360
could not talk out to the Internet and

539
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:45,009
there's intelligent power and there's

540
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,668
apts and blah blah blah and you can

541
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:54,039
always find a way around things but you

542
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:59,889
can stop a huge amount of malware and

543
00:24:54,039 --> 00:25:02,620
other bad things trademark just by by

544
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:04,299
filtering us traffic if you can't do

545
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,459
that then you have no hope in hell it

546
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:08,440
doesn't matter what else you're doing

547
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:12,429
because you are wide open to the

548
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:14,139
Internet multi-factor off I've got

549
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:15,669
slides on on all of this so I'm not

550
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:19,899
going to go into too much detail but

551
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:22,779
it's a necessary evil it's necessary for

552
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:23,070
a lot of things management access and

553
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:24,919
I'm not

554
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:28,110
talking about your domain and mins yes

555
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:31,399
the company with 600 people in 85 domain

556
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:35,729
admins was not in a very good place but

557
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:37,258
what about your infrastructure how do

558
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,639
you control management access to your

559
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:41,429
infrastructure your firewalls your

560
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:44,549
routers your switches your sand switches

561
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:47,309
don't forget about those because VMware

562
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:50,970
backups are a great orwell and VMware

563
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:52,980
images of any sort are all that anyone

564
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:55,049
needs to own your environment very very

565
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,480
quickly what about the network

566
00:25:55,049 --> 00:25:59,759
infrastructure itself your your network

567
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:04,620
vendor has a ton of features that are

568
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:06,179
probably turned off passwords yeah I've

569
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,178
got to talk about passwords I will try

570
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:12,830
not to talk too much about passwords

571
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:15,450
there are things we can do better and

572
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:17,610
probably the hardest thing is the

573
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:20,389
logging monitoring reporting but again

574
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:23,519
you can't just throw your hands up and

575
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:25,830
decide you can't do it you got to start

576
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:29,970
somewhere and I would argue that you

577
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:31,559
don't want to start with everything and

578
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,960
then trying to sift through that and

579
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:38,220
find what you need to find I that is

580
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:41,399
definitely not going to be good for you

581
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,889
so I you know pick something one thing

582
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:44,969
if you can pick the one most evil thing

583
00:26:43,889 --> 00:26:48,779
that could happen in your environment

584
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,429
and alert on that and prove that you can

585
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:53,129
alert on that

586
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:54,090
step1 step2 what's the next most evil

587
00:26:53,129 --> 00:26:56,059
thing that could happen in your

588
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:59,009
environment so we'll talk about that

589
00:26:56,059 --> 00:27:01,080
some network diagram if you can't

590
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:03,809
describe it to me you can't defend it

591
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:06,769
it's it's as simple as that you have to

592
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:09,509
have an understanding of your network so

593
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:15,769
how many organizations have a network

594
00:27:09,509 --> 00:27:18,840
team and it's and a security team and

595
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:20,580
how many of those security teams can

596
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,120
actually tell you how the network is

597
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:27,389
laid out right like these are important

598
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,789
things you know who controls DNS in your

599
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:32,610
environment who who creates provisions

600
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:35,260
accounts what what should be logging

601
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:38,199
into what what should be talking to what

602
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:40,629
these the silos kill me really like you

603
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:44,710
need to have you are not just paid to

604
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:47,350
operate a firewall or a sim or a remote

605
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:49,240
access thingy madhu Hickey you are paid

606
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,800
to secure your environment you need to

607
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,360
understand your environment don't tell

608
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,120
me that's his job to understand that

609
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,979
application that web server that Active

610
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,580
Directory whatever it is you have to

611
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:04,150
have an understanding and not only of

612
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:06,760
the environment but the risk let's so

613
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:09,190
we're doing more with less let's focus

614
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,930
on where we actually need to where we

615
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,690
get the best value I mean you could have

616
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:16,060
you find all kinds of talks on bang for

617
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:18,420
buck security value let's let's actually

618
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:21,490
understand what our business risk is and

619
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,710
start tackling that you know let's let's

620
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:26,820
actually come up stairs from the

621
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:29,980
basement and talk to people understand

622
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:31,389
what makes your company tick what the

623
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,380
pain points are because you also got it

624
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,420
you still have to make this usable

625
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:39,870
whatever this is that you're putting

626
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:44,110
together I've said this multiple times

627
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:49,510
and and my experience has been that a

628
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:53,889
good business analyst can help more than

629
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:57,879
a handful of security practitioners in

630
00:28:53,890 --> 00:29:00,370
the right context obviously but they are

631
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,530
the people that can actually take a

632
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:04,959
technology understand a technology or

633
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:06,490
understand a problem and go over here

634
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,060
and talk to the people that actually

635
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:11,170
make money for your company and

636
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,950
understand how those two things relate

637
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:14,410
to each other

638
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,420
and they're also not afraid to talk to

639
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,610
people and they're not afraid to

640
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:20,290
document or put a process around

641
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,090
something or figure out where we need to

642
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:24,070
get and map out the steps to go from

643
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:26,169
here to there I'm one of those guys that

644
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:27,700
goes from here to there but there are

645
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:31,810
people that don't do that and you need

646
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:35,230
to go from through all the steps right

647
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:37,090
and and of course access needs to be

648
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:39,730
reviewed updated managed blah blah blah

649
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:43,209
we you know that's another one those age

650
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:48,440
old adages so let's start by turning it

651
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:51,020
on all right so what what do

652
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,240
most vendors sell you they sell you

653
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:55,610
something that you can plug in and be

654
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:59,570
successful for some definition of

655
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:01,520
successful with it's bad business for me

656
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:04,389
to sell you something that you plug in

657
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:07,370
and it breaks your environment so

658
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:11,480
chances are the default configuration is

659
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:12,860
not the one you want so let's let's

660
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,320
actually you know again back to the

661
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:18,199
project manager let's play with this in

662
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,480
a lab let's turn things on gradually no

663
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,250
one is saying you need to take every

664
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,850
feature and light up the whole box all

665
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,650
at once

666
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:27,290
whatever you know whether there are

667
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:29,060
blades or this or features or whatever

668
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:31,129
it is you don't need to light them all

669
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,659
up at once but you need to have a plan

670
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:35,180
to progress through that and start

671
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,920
lighting them up turn on a feature do

672
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,750
some testing make sure it works in the

673
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:41,300
lab turn that feature on in production

674
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:43,400
keep moving through there are some

675
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:46,370
pretty cool features I think it might be

676
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:49,130
on another slide but who has visibility

677
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:52,729
or even better yet control over their

678
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:57,590
DNS yeah that's what I thought

679
00:30:52,730 --> 00:31:00,140
for the record zero but that capability

680
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:02,179
is built into half a dozen different

681
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:06,590
windows and security products that you

682
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:11,360
probably have so you know that might be

683
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:14,449
something you want to look into positive

684
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,280
enforcement model that's that's the buzz

685
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:18,560
buzz word catch phrase whatever you want

686
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,980
to call it how about we start with

687
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:23,360
nothing and build up from there

688
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:26,030
who's ever had the experience where they

689
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,909
talk to the we'll call them the

690
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:31,490
webmaster and who's trying to make their

691
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:33,470
application work and they say well the

692
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,760
vendor they say just allow everything

693
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:37,580
else through the firewall and I don't

694
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,760
know what ports I need what access I

695
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:42,460
need I don't understand really even what

696
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,360
database I'm talking to and what

697
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,590
application server I'm talking to I'm

698
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,939
just a web guy I've just got a web

699
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:49,550
server so just allow me to talk to

700
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:51,260
everything and and you know you can lock

701
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:52,430
it down after afterwards you can go back

702
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,620
and look at the logs and figure it out

703
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:57,620
and lock it down anyone had that

704
00:31:54,620 --> 00:32:00,050
experience anyone gone back and locked

705
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,500
it down successfully and gotten

706
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:05,580
permission to do that

707
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:07,760
that doesn't happen so let's start you

708
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:10,110
know it back to the project management

709
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,120
discipline or the development discipline

710
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:15,000
or the implementation discipline you

711
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:17,189
know what it's not that hard let me sit

712
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,590
down with you for an hour and we'll

713
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:21,960
start turning things on Oh that's

714
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:23,699
blocked okay that makes sense to allow

715
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,700
let's allow that let's make that work

716
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,710
but no bypassing all of the security

717
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,110
because it's breaking my app is not the

718
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:33,630
right answer

719
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:35,719
let's walk by default which leads right

720
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:42,810
into egress filtering right

721
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:44,670
so who today really needs to connect to

722
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:46,889
the internet for anything other than web

723
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:48,570
browsing for the average user really I

724
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:52,880
mean yes you've got servers you've got

725
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:57,899
applications they do stuff but okay so

726
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:59,220
let's block all the ports let's make

727
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:01,580
sure everything else goes through

728
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:05,670
something that can look at the traffic I

729
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:09,629
don't know I I don't know quite how

730
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:11,760
feasible this is but John strand he's an

731
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:15,570
instructor for sans he has a bit of a

732
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:20,760
rant on the internet and the crux of it

733
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:21,780
is he's a proponent now of blocking

734
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,440
access to the Internet

735
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:27,899
take the Alexa top thousand two thousand

736
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,450
ten thousand not million but few

737
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:32,070
thousand websites or take your own logs

738
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:37,530
assuming you have them and can parse

739
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:39,780
them and access them take the top X

740
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:42,149
thousand websites that your company has

741
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:44,970
accessed in the last year last six

742
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:48,060
months whatever whitelist them block

743
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:49,380
everything else period now I'm not

744
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:52,200
saying make it hard to get unblocked

745
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,390
provide when it gets blocked there's a

746
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:58,050
link I click the link as a user

747
00:33:54,390 --> 00:34:00,330
it gets unblocked so what is more of a

748
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:04,620
risk to you right how many web sites are

749
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:08,668
there on the Internet billions hundreds

750
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:10,319
of billions I don't know how many of

751
00:34:08,668 --> 00:34:13,299
those do you need to use in your

752
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,030
organization even if it's millions

753
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:18,460
that's a very very very small percentage

754
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:20,140
of the internet so I don't I have never

755
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,780
seen this in practice this is John's

756
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:23,290
thing these days but you know what block

757
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,990
it all

758
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:28,418
take your top 10,000 allow those and

759
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:32,529
make it easy for people to allow the

760
00:34:28,418 --> 00:34:37,210
ones that they want you are still I tell

761
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:40,179
you you know a GRS qfy Z tom is not

762
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:43,720
going to be on that list of things that

763
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:46,600
people need to access along with the

764
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:51,759
other what 40,000 a day malware sites

765
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:54,779
that pop up right and in all other ports

766
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:59,200
just there's there's no reason I'll

767
00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:03,660
create exceptions as needed yeah gaming

768
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,620
you need gaming yeah yeah of course

769
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,629
because what else are they going to do

770
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:12,240
the the seven hours of the day when

771
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:14,890
they're not working intercept SSL so I

772
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,959
in talking to people I have my idea of

773
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:19,960
how many people are intercepting SSL but

774
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,250
for the record who is intercepting SSL I

775
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:25,800
think I asked this already and I only

776
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:28,120
saw a couple hands yeah there's a few so

777
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:32,620
knowing where you work that's for

778
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:39,250
companies and that's actually one more

779
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:41,859
than I was aware of so if so let me ask

780
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:44,680
another question then who has an

781
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,870
application sandboxing product I'm

782
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,210
trying not to mention vendor names but

783
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:50,890
something that that purports to grab

784
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:52,300
executables as they're downloaded and

785
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:54,879
run them and tell you if they're safe

786
00:35:52,300 --> 00:36:00,220
and secure and so on who has a product

787
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:02,080
or a feature like that really nobody ok

788
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:06,879
so more than the for people who are

789
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:10,870
intercepting SSL does anyone else see

790
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,150
the disconnect here what exactly is it

791
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:16,509
that you are sandboxing if you're not

792
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:18,670
intercepting SSL right we've got to get

793
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:20,220
some of these things aligned in the

794
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:24,720
right order here

795
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:26,799
SSL what 60% of normal traffic is SSL I

796
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,549
want to tell you

797
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,980
I don't know the vast majority of

798
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:41,560
malware is using SSL in some way shape

799
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:45,580
or form so you intercept SSL egress

800
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:47,049
filtering if you do one thing besides

801
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,060
maybe multi-factor aasif you're not

802
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,950
doing it already

803
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:53,980
intercept SSL cuz you cannot you have

804
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:56,680
all these products that purport to stop

805
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:59,170
the bad if they can't see the bad they

806
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:02,859
can't stop the bad and you know what

807
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:06,430
certificates scary right they are not

808
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:09,730
that hard spend you know an hour

809
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:11,319
learning how certificates work spend

810
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,870
some time rolling this capability out

811
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:16,390
gradually start with you know your team

812
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:17,980
IT doesn't matter if it takes a year to

813
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:19,480
roll it all the way out you will have

814
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:22,360
things that break you will have to

815
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,640
create exceptions it's not a big deal I

816
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:27,280
come back to this with patching with all

817
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:31,930
kinds of things is the world going to

818
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:33,790
end if that application breaks I mean we

819
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:36,790
have a lot of people in this room I'm

820
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:40,600
assuming with control systems and they

821
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:43,860
are critical and they are but do you

822
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:48,330
guys have anything in your control that

823
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:52,210
would prevent you know that would stop

824
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:54,400
operations cold does anyone have

825
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:56,110
anything that is in their purview that

826
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,890
if it wasn't working with stop

827
00:37:56,110 --> 00:38:02,380
operations cold so there's there are

828
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:05,200
some things and but there were three

829
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:07,060
hands right you should know what those

830
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,609
things are you should be able to test

831
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:12,040
and validate and make sure that they're

832
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:13,360
working with whatever it is that you are

833
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,400
implementing and then we have these

834
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,290
things called change windows and we can

835
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,820
schedule changes and we can have people

836
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:20,890
standing by just in case we do break

837
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:25,600
things and let's start turning this

838
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:27,490
stuff on you know again URL filtering I

839
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:32,799
put after the SSL interception because

840
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:36,279
again if you're not intercepting SSL you

841
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,540
know and HR yeah give them a list of

842
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,130
categories let them come back and tell

843
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,980
you what categories to block I really

844
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,270
don't care

845
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,750
as long as you are blocking that

846
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:47,630
category that's called malware or

847
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:52,040
potentially unwanted software or unknown

848
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:55,460
is another good one none right block

849
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:57,050
those at least please preferably

850
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,820
advertisements I didn't get to go to

851
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:01,340
that presentation did anyone go to that

852
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:03,880
presentation today anyone want to go

853
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:07,730
back and block all advertisements now

854
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:09,950
right like let's if HR says no we're not

855
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:12,580
blocking anything well no one's gonna

856
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:15,859
complain if you block malware all right

857
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:18,950
let's let's do that and then and then we

858
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:21,350
get to the any's rule of thumb it

859
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:23,240
doesn't apply across the board but our

860
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:25,009
most firewall rules have this thing

861
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:29,209
called a source three columns source

862
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:32,570
destination port I do not want to see

863
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:35,540
two any's in any firewall rule of that

864
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:39,770
those three things no two of them should

865
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:41,840
be any ever you can enumerate much

866
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:44,390
better what you need access to you need

867
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,070
access to that web server to RDP okay

868
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:48,910
I'm not allowing RDP to the Internet I'm

869
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:52,280
allowing web server RDP never mind but

870
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:55,040
I'm allowing RDP access to that one

871
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,320
server or this server needs access to

872
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,150
the whole Internet okay that source can

873
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:06,020
get to any but I don't want to see to

874
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:10,520
Enys in any rule and I I mentioned it

875
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:12,890
earlier manager DNS all of the next-gen

876
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:16,520
firewalls there I said it again have a

877
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:18,230
DNS capability of some sort I don't care

878
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,359
where you get your list it could even

879
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:24,680
just be reactive from an incident

880
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:27,560
response perspective but be able to tell

881
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:30,140
where so two things one be able to block

882
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,740
DNS if I can if I tell you this domain

883
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,290
is evil

884
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:35,000
just it's true it's the easiest way to

885
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,650
stop anybody from accessing that domain

886
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,369
right you're not gonna block the IP

887
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:39,020
address

888
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:40,609
you're gonna block the domain and yeah

889
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,170
there's there's malware that takes

890
00:40:40,609 --> 00:40:44,210
advantage of multiple techniques to get

891
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:48,320
around that but still I want to be able

892
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:50,420
to block a domain not only that it was

893
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,610
Doug's presentation - Doug stay in the

894
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,440
room no he's gone yesterday

895
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:58,940
right you can get an amazing amount of

896
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:00,350
Intel from your DNS logs even if even if

897
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,510
you forget about the details and just

898
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:05,120
look at the trending all of a sudden I'm

899
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:08,480
seeing spikes in this kind of domain or

900
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:10,430
from this area you know quantity of DNS

901
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,840
requests DNS requests to certain

902
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:16,279
countries domains you if you look at if

903
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,720
you understand your DNS you will see

904
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,210
same thing with the top 1,000 websites

905
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:22,430
you are resolving the top 1,000 DNS

906
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:24,290
names all the time the rest of it

907
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:26,000
especially if you trim them back down to

908
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:29,330
the root domain not the root but you

909
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,470
know two domains like Akamai dotnet yes

910
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:33,529
I know there's a bunch of stuff that

911
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:35,450
comes in front of it strip that off but

912
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,590
you can tell an amazing amount from what

913
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:39,589
you are talking to you from a DNS

914
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:40,820
perspective and you don't have to look

915
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:42,530
at packets you don't have to look at

916
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:48,650
anything else it will tell you right

917
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:52,610
there multifactor off I got to bring it

918
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:56,570
up just because there are still people

919
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:58,550
not doing it and we can argue all day

920
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:01,360
long whether Outlook Web Access should

921
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:06,500
be included in this remote access

922
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:08,420
certainly should your password safe I

923
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:12,410
love it when people integrate their

924
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:14,480
password safe with Active Directory or

925
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:16,819
better yet when I come back the next

926
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,990
year they manually synchronize their

927
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,640
active directory password with their

928
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:25,669
password safe password since they now

929
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:27,560
disconnected them you know I've I'm

930
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:31,750
trying not to belabor the whole password

931
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:35,330
thing people suck at them my experience

932
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:36,890
90% or more of passwords start with an

933
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:38,600
uppercase letter followed by a bunch of

934
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:41,000
lowercase letters followed by some

935
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:44,660
numbers my right now that would be

936
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,150
spring 2016 right we're getting into

937
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:48,859
summer 2016 you have anywhere more than

938
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:50,510
two hundred users one of them is using

939
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,980
that as their password is guess what we

940
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:53,390
change it every 90 days and I think I

941
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:57,020
had a slide on passwords so I'll save

942
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:59,180
that for that slide bottom line I will

943
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,740
guess a password there is no doubt about

944
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:03,910
it especially since LinkedIn will tell

945
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:06,500
me every user ID I need to know so

946
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:10,190
multi-factor off remote access

947
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:12,290
100% if Ike if I can use that thing to

948
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:14,300
get command execution in your

949
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:19,040
environment it better have multi-factor

950
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:21,470
enabled password safe yeah probably if

951
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:24,259
you are one of those lucky people who

952
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:26,598
has something like smart cards they come

953
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:28,550
with their own set of pain I get it but

954
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:30,820
then start using that for network year

955
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:34,490
you know your infrastructure management

956
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:36,500
email we could argue about all day there

957
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:39,169
it's really hard to make email usable

958
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:44,300
with multi-factor access but at the same

959
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:45,920
time most pen tests I will find the

960
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,330
Outlook Web Access portal and brute

961
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,810
force passwords even if you're using

962
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:52,700
multi factor auth I was sitting there I

963
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:56,000
will guest passwords I will send an

964
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:57,439
email to everybody to find out who's out

965
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,840
of the office then I will phone the

966
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,550
helpdesk and say or better yet if you're

967
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,020
using a cloud-based ticketing system

968
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:05,060
I'll log in and create a ticket saying

969
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,920
I've lost my RSA token or whatever it is

970
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,380
and then I'll phone the helpdesk and get

971
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,240
you to give me one because I had some

972
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:15,140
public way to guess your username or

973
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:16,069
your password you know if you if I can

974
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:21,290
log into something in your environment

975
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:23,690
you're done so management access to

976
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:26,990
infrastructure it's amazing how many

977
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:28,130
times I go in and it's like well you can

978
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:30,500
log into switches and routers from

979
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:31,839
anywhere do you really have that many

980
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:35,240
people administering your network

981
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:38,420
firewalls to write restrict by source IP

982
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:40,910
and do not integrate with AD because as

983
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:42,619
I just explained I will guess a password

984
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:43,940
I will then get an administrator

985
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:46,130
password and I'll get a domain admin

986
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:47,990
password and then I will add myself to

987
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:51,740
whatever groups I need to add myself to

988
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:54,950
to manage your firewall to manage your

989
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:57,169
whatever else so do not use ad for that

990
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:59,569
but centralize it because those local

991
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:01,760
passwords you know we suck at managing

992
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:04,490
those too so you spin up a radius server

993
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,859
or something stand alone put accounts in

994
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:09,348
it manage those because now you only

995
00:45:06,859 --> 00:45:12,740
have well two for most of you or fewer

996
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:14,150
people who have accounts that I can try

997
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,609
and brute force to get into your

998
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:20,490
infrastructure if you can manage out a

999
00:45:16,609 --> 00:45:24,710
bound out of band by all means do it

1000
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:24,709
please it's not always that easy

1001
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:31,380
lockout and password policies so do I

1002
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:32,069
actually have a slide on passwords yes

1003
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,619
idiot okay

1004
00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:36,750
but lock accounts out your

1005
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:39,180
administrators we've just said you have

1006
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:42,869
separate accounts and passwords for

1007
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:45,328
managing your infrastructure so those

1008
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:46,920
passwords can have a strong those

1009
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:49,170
accounts and passwords can have strong

1010
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,990
policy enforced I'm not going to go into

1011
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:54,540
what strong is on this slide yet but you

1012
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:58,618
know there's there's different opinions

1013
00:45:54,540 --> 00:46:03,509
there and let's turn off telnet and HTTP

1014
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:05,510
and rsh please you should be using

1015
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:10,050
encrypted protocols only you should and

1016
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:16,050
snmpv1 and too for that matter these are

1017
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:20,250
all real really basic hygiene but they

1018
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:21,900
they make an attackers life much much

1019
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,730
harder I'm gonna have to work a whole

1020
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:26,869
lot harder to get a hold of your

1021
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:31,559
infrastructure if you do these things

1022
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:34,200
from a network point of view so private

1023
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:36,630
VLANs turn them on for all workstations

1024
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,609
who who can give me a legitimate reason

1025
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:41,549
for two workstations and I'm talking I

1026
00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:44,869
mean I'm sure there are cases but your

1027
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:46,859
average user in a 5,000 user company

1028
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:49,410
whose workstation needs to talk to

1029
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:54,000
somebody else's workstation and as I say

1030
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:59,259
that I'm thinking Skype crap but

1031
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:01,270
so allow them to talk Skype but still

1032
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:03,510
you can segment there's no legitimate

1033
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:06,040
reason for me to map a drive or to talk

1034
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:08,230
windows management protocols except from

1035
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:10,360
my management network to end

1036
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:12,070
workstations you know how quickly that

1037
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,800
stops me from wandering around your

1038
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:17,170
environment until I have admin access

1039
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:19,450
segment further if you can dynamic ARP

1040
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:22,330
spoofing DHCP snooping these are

1041
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:24,399
features all switches have them again

1042
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:26,529
they will prevent man-in-the-middle

1043
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,040
attacks while not prevent but they will

1044
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:33,040
go a long ways you have routing

1045
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:35,200
protocols it's one line to put a key in

1046
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,700
those routing protocols so that I can't

1047
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,529
become a router on your network and

1048
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:41,470
wrote all the traffic through me it's

1049
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:46,810
not hard to do same with HHS RP vrrp

1050
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:48,540
whatever it is unused ports so the way I

1051
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:51,580
disable unused ports that's hard right

1052
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:52,779
well how about I can I actually haven't

1053
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,990
written it so I shouldn't say I can give

1054
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:58,450
you a script that will connect via SNMP

1055
00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:02,319
v3 to all of the switches in your

1056
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:05,350
environment and list all of the down the

1057
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:07,120
ports that are down store that away come

1058
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:09,160
back two weeks later if any port is

1059
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,450
still down it gets disabled and I do

1060
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:13,089
that you know do that during prime time

1061
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:16,509
when ports are expected to be active you

1062
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:18,910
can automate that easily so people can't

1063
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:21,310
plug in I mean is it your biggest risk

1064
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:23,649
probably not but but we have ports

1065
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:26,410
everywhere right it's that's that's an

1066
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:28,720
trivially easy thing to do backup your

1067
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:30,580
configurations then make sure I can't

1068
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,259
TFTP to the TFTP server where the

1069
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:35,830
configuration sit with the passwords in

1070
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:36,610
them detect changes if you're backing up

1071
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,590
your configs

1072
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:41,440
you should get an alert every time a

1073
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:42,760
config changes because it's certainly

1074
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,890
talking network infrastructure that

1075
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,570
shouldn't happen that much and I mean

1076
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:49,960
tune as appropriate for your environment

1077
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:53,500
so on and so forth but um and update the

1078
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:55,870
software again you've got two big

1079
00:48:53,500 --> 00:49:00,010
chassis like switches in your data

1080
00:48:55,870 --> 00:49:01,960
center probably probably more there's

1081
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:05,350
this thing called H a failover fault

1082
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:07,390
tolerance use it failover to this one

1083
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:11,019
update this one

1084
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:13,660
failback we don't have to be on the

1085
00:49:11,019 --> 00:49:18,729
every three-year update cycle for our

1086
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:19,868
network infrastructure passwords I'm

1087
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:22,150
running out of time so I'm not going to

1088
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:24,609
go into it in depth long passwords long

1089
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:27,069
passwords forget complexity I'm sick of

1090
00:49:24,609 --> 00:49:30,609
complexity do not change them every 90

1091
00:49:27,069 --> 00:49:33,390
days I think that was another John

1092
00:49:30,609 --> 00:49:38,200
strand ISM you know where that came from

1093
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:41,558
1984 NIST green book audit

1094
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:45,399
recommendations because at that time it

1095
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:49,450
took about six months to crack an eight

1096
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:51,279
character password 1984 folks I don't

1097
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:54,129
know when wargames came out but it was

1098
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:56,079
probably before that time all right so

1099
00:49:54,130 --> 00:50:00,190
this whole concept of a password change

1100
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:02,859
every 90 days is that's how we

1101
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:06,579
end up with spring 2016 summer 2016 fall

1102
00:50:02,859 --> 00:50:09,250
2016 winter 2016 let's just make

1103
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:11,230
passwords long and if you have anyone

1104
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:13,440
complained to you that they can't type

1105
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:16,119
long passwords send them a text message

1106
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:19,650
ask to see their text messages if you

1107
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:22,269
can type on your frickin phone that much

1108
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:24,190
you can have a long password thank you

1109
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:26,019
very much

1110
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:28,390
manage the local passwords whether that

1111
00:50:26,019 --> 00:50:30,339
switches routers servers whatever do not

1112
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:33,549
use Group Policy preferences if you

1113
00:50:30,339 --> 00:50:35,529
don't know what those are Google GPP if

1114
00:50:33,549 --> 00:50:37,630
you even if you're not using them today

1115
00:50:35,529 --> 00:50:39,579
make sure you weren't using them five

1116
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:44,289
years ago and still haven't changed that

1117
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:46,450
password Microsoft has a tool that

1118
00:50:44,289 --> 00:50:48,549
people are finding ways to leverage as

1119
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:51,299
well but it's new ish called laughs

1120
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:54,279
local administrative password something

1121
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:56,049
that allows you to manage unique local

1122
00:50:54,279 --> 00:50:58,000
admin passwords for every device in

1123
00:50:56,049 --> 00:51:00,099
Active Directory again if I pop Active

1124
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,390
Directory you're done but that's still

1125
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:06,220
better than having the same admin

1126
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:07,359
password on every box don't surf from

1127
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,390
your administrative account right

1128
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:12,279
separate accounts for admin access

1129
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:14,769
granular don't have 89 out of 600 user

1130
00:51:12,279 --> 00:51:16,990
sorry that wasn't yeah with 600 users be

1131
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:20,180
domain admins deep provision access when

1132
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:25,098
people don't need it talking

1133
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:26,930
learning if you you should be at a state

1134
00:51:25,099 --> 00:51:29,349
where you could alert every single time

1135
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:31,339
a domain admin logs in interactively and

1136
00:51:29,349 --> 00:51:33,410
for different definitions and

1137
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:35,900
interactively why not you should be in

1138
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:37,759
that position or when someone grants

1139
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,829
themself that kind of access you should

1140
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,710
be able to log that talking about

1141
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:45,740
logging pick one thing that's a good one

1142
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:47,990
and log and alert on that once you've

1143
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:50,689
got that working let's start by getting

1144
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:52,578
the logs of course but and you can do

1145
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:55,579
the trending DNS trending I talked about

1146
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:57,500
that but pick one thing alert on it

1147
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:59,720
logging in is domain admin addition to

1148
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:02,180
domain and main group service creation

1149
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:04,848
because a lot of malware creates

1150
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:06,109
services just to get their privilege

1151
00:52:04,849 --> 00:52:07,790
escalation and then the service goes

1152
00:52:06,109 --> 00:52:09,170
away you should know when a service gets

1153
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:12,200
created cuz that shouldn't happen that

1154
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:15,440
much so pick one thing alert tune it

1155
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,609
back another keep going you know there's

1156
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,599
these buzzwords like continuous

1157
00:52:16,609 --> 00:52:23,359
improvement do it it's back to that yeah

1158
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:27,290
it's hard but just sitting back and

1159
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:30,130
giving up isn't the answer either so you

1160
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:30,130
know get better over time

1161
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:38,619
so really in summary let's get the

1162
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:40,730
basics right none of these things

1163
00:52:38,619 --> 00:52:44,540
require you to purchase a product

1164
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:48,079
multi-factor authentication

1165
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:50,150
in a pinch advanced firewall features

1166
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,490
like URL filtering maybe there's you

1167
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:55,099
know I'm not saying there's no cost but

1168
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:57,740
very little of what I've talked about

1169
00:52:55,099 --> 00:53:00,530
today requires you to buy something it's

1170
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:01,939
configure these stuff that you have go

1171
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:04,000
back and look at what the stuff that you

1172
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:08,480
have can do and configure it to do it I

1173
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,250
will take one capable person over number

1174
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,760
one over four incapable people and

1175
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:16,280
number two over any magic bullet product

1176
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,740
right one person can make a huge

1177
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,119
difference and that person is typically

1178
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:22,368
someone that understands what a packet

1179
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:26,049
looks like that can parse through a ton

1180
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:28,880
of data it's not a person that has the

1181
00:53:26,049 --> 00:53:31,359
who is a something something certified

1182
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,359
expert

1183
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,590
you already have the products so take

1184
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:39,779
the time you know honestly the other way

1185
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:42,810
to look at this is hire that guy

1186
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:44,360
straight out of university and throw

1187
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:47,310
them in there and say learn this stuff

1188
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:50,520
figure it out and tell me what I can do

1189
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:52,290
better right that's either way let's

1190
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:55,770
let's get this stuff right before we go

1191
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:57,920
out and shell out more cash so end of

1192
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,920
rant

1193
00:54:10,369 --> 00:54:34,869
disagreements

1194
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:38,229
I'm wrong all the time by the way and if

1195
00:54:34,869 --> 00:54:40,420
I'm intercepting SSL so HTTPS and

1196
00:54:38,229 --> 00:54:45,029
checking to see that it is HTTPS I

1197
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:45,029
should have the same effect of blocking

1198
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:20,050
yeah no I mean I agree here I was wrong

1199
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:22,450
but a lot of it is port 443 by

1200
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:26,079
intercepting SSL and making sure it is

1201
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:27,879
HTTP over SSL or on whatever making sure

1202
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:32,970
that it's encrypted HTTP traffic on port

1203
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:57,579
443 you are still preventing all of that

1204
00:55:32,970 --> 00:56:09,730
any other mistakes yes but you're not

1205
00:55:57,579 --> 00:56:12,550
targets you know what that I find that

1206
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:14,349
to be a very intriguing option if I had

1207
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:16,119
a you know a small environment that I

1208
00:56:14,349 --> 00:56:19,510
own and I would consider doing that I

1209
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:21,369
really would because we really only use

1210
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:23,589
this small little piece of the Internet

1211
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:25,720
day-to-day you know got your email your

1212
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:30,460
social media and your sports and then

1213
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:34,589
the business all right

1214
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:34,589
thanks Steven much appreciated
