1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,660
I thought I would start the

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,349
controversial title and we'll see how we

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,780
go

4
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:11,759
apparently I'm to get you all excited so

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,259
that you start the two days in good

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,309
style so we'll see how well I manage to

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,400
do that

8
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,990
I do a number of keynotes through the

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,229
year I have to confess I prefer these

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,759
because normally this folks in suits and

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,590
I'm talking about

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,869
why cyber risk is something they should

13
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,029
care about or why it's really important

14
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,650
and the likelihood I kind of get the

15
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,530
feeling I'd be preaching to the

16
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,900
converted if I did that so I thought I'd

17
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,310
do something a little bit different and

18
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,629
I thought I'd talk about something else

19
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,610
it's a little bit closer to my heart

20
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,620
which is to have a little bit of an

21
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,860
inward look at the security industry and

22
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,629
the way we behave the things we do and

23
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,300
why I think some of the stuff we do is a

24
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,990
little bit broken maybe very broken and

25
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,370
therefore what can we do to maybe change

26
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,810
what we do to actually have a bigger

27
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,760
impact to make the world a better and

28
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:04,890
safer place so a little bit about me 24

29
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,658
years living in Cheltenham we'll leave

30
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,969
it there certain doughnut-shaped

31
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,670
building lovely career I think I

32
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:14,969
recognize a few faces as well so they

33
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,429
are amongst us but about three and a

34
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:21,390
half years ago I had an opportunity to

35
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:24,329
become C so for the RBS group it meant

36
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,829
to move to Scotland which I've said that

37
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:29,490
is very nice but doesn't quite agree

38
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:31,258
with my waistline but for me it was a

39
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,259
great opportunity because I'd spent many

40
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,090
years sign government telling industry

41
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,460
and other government departments what

42
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,619
they should do to be secure and I was

43
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,178
very conscious that I'd spent of my

44
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,890
twenty four years in government about

45
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:47,520
half of those were doing that kind of

46
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,740
job and I was really concerned that I

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,350
was talking from the position of an

48
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,990
ivory tower and I wanted to demonstrate

49
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,509
to the world or at least to myself that

50
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,920
I could go and do a job where actually I

51
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,829
do have a fixed budget

52
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,780
I do have fixed resources I do have

53
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,600
business priorities and that I could

54
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,330
balance all of those and still do

55
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,250
security really really well so that's

56
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,510
what took me to Edinburgh

57
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,040
for those of you that don't know RBS

58
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,920
group you might just think Royal Bank of

59
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,440
Scotland to put into context RBS group

60
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:27,010
oh yes robbing Scotland we own that

61
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:30,230
worst Koontz child and Coe Adam and O

62
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:33,170
test my memory now but Papa yeah a child

63
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:36,290
and Co which is the oldest one of the

64
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:39,769
oldest private banks in the world dates

65
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:43,130
back to 1640 sometimes it feels like RIT

66
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:47,150
was inherited from 1640 but we have to

67
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:48,859
keep it safe and secure nonetheless and

68
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:52,310
given all of that that means that I'm in

69
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:55,750
the in this I think interesting position

70
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:59,050
of having to secure about 70,000 staff

71
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:03,530
some of whom can spell security and

72
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:05,150
about 19 million customers for whom they

73
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,940
are nine times out of ten the target of

74
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,370
the attack mutters using technology that

75
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,290
we have not given them so my problem is

76
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,090
to look at that bigger picture and work

77
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:17,298
out how we can keep customer knees safe

78
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:19,549
and as I see so my job is quite broad so

79
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:21,470
I do information security I have the

80
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:23,060
interesting job of physical security so

81
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,620
I get all of the pretty diagrams of what

82
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,600
happens when a bomb goes off outsider

83
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,090
headquarters or a London offices that's

84
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,920
quite interesting and I'm also

85
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,860
accountable for fraud prevention as well

86
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,109
so my job is to put in place the

87
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,660
controls that protect our customers and

88
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:41,420
help prevent their and fallen victim to

89
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,400
fraud or more each increasingly nowadays

90
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,260
scams so I think that's kind like any

91
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,500
interest in portfolio things to look

92
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:51,620
after but I've learnt a lot and I think

93
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,200
my view on security has changed from

94
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,180
when I was sat in government giving

95
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:01,160
advice to where I'm now sat with the

96
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,870
budget and those responsibilities so

97
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,930
we'll start with a bit of a history

98
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:07,130
lesson some examples of why I would

99
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,260
assert that what we're doing isn't

100
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:13,910
working

101
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:17,269
nineteen sixties blank looks Captain

102
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:20,350
Crunch few nods I don't want to know the

103
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,350
significance of Captain Crunch

104
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:27,169
someone shout out Captain Crunch and the

105
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:29,690
whistle exactly the the interesting

106
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:32,030
about Captain Crunch was that they gave

107
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,710
away a free toy in the 1960s it was a

108
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,520
whistle and it turned out that that

109
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:40,070
whistle was a perfect 2600 Hertz which

110
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,490
is pretty innocuous until you discovered

111
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:45,800
that AT&T s phone system used a 2600

112
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,570
Hertz tone to tell the exchange that

113
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,479
you'd put a coin in the machine in the

114
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:52,699
pay phone so what they were doing the

115
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,260
the young scamp's as they were were

116
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:55,910
going up to the payphones because I

117
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,370
think in the u.s. local calls are free

118
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,990
but they would pick up the handset they

119
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,880
would blow the whistle down the handset

120
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,930
the exchange would go thank you for your

121
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,919
money you could make a long-distance

122
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:09,410
phone call to me and I'm sure Sameer is

123
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:12,260
that not a bit like client-side security

124
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,930
of something we deemed to be a bit bad

125
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:17,539
and that was in the 1960s what are we

126
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:20,360
now have 50 odd years later and still

127
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:21,469
making the same mistakes so in 50 years

128
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,030
we haven't really learned that lesson

129
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,949
particularly well I mean we all know it

130
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,919
but generally as a technology industry

131
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:31,370
still makes a mistake would anyone like

132
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:36,799
to guess where the when the first

133
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:41,510
documented buffer overflow was he

134
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:44,199
guesses very very close 97 that not

135
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:47,539
quite 1977 1972

136
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:49,639
so 1972 there's an academic paper and I

137
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:50,930
was trying to find it last night and I

138
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,669
was really struggling as I was writing

139
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,949
my notes so I haven't able to find the

140
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:57,409
title as an academic paper published in

141
00:05:54,949 --> 00:06:00,139
1972 it doesn't call it a buffer

142
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:01,219
overflow but it basically describes the

143
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:04,310
vulnerability that's a buffer overflow

144
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,930
the fact that you can insert too much

145
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:09,500
information into the allocated memory

146
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:14,690
and overwrite adjacent data so that was

147
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:18,440
1972 nearly 40 a former metal riff

148
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:21,710
expelling me 48 49 years ago have we

149
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,360
solved that problem yet not going by the

150
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,750
list of vulnerabilities I get have to

151
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,740
patch every month so in 40 odd years we

152
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:34,090
haven't fixed that lesson I'll move for

153
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,270
a little bit more in time 1990s Mitnick

154
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:40,789
if you

155
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:41,960
not Mitnick was famous for UNIX was a

156
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,270
she was more famous for social

157
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,830
engineering so a lot of what Mitnick did

158
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,870
was phony that the telephone companies

159
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:51,140
and just asking them how stuff worked or

160
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:53,210
asking people for the passwords he's not

161
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,360
the first evidence of a confidence

162
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:59,390
trickster or confidence artist that goes

163
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,010
back in the histories of time and yet

164
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,289
today one of the biggest problems I have

165
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,719
to tackle is people phoning up my call

166
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,490
centers trying to social engineer people

167
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,310
on the end of the phone or more commonly

168
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:13,220
phoning that my customers and persuading

169
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,800
them to do things that ideally isn't in

170
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,540
their best interest so again that's been

171
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,920
going on for decades and we still

172
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,950
haven't got a solution for confidence

173
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,830
artists yet so maybe what we're doing

174
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:27,170
isn't working

175
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:31,390
2003 another landmark in InfoSec history

176
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:31,390
anyone like to guess what happened 2003

177
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:37,190
sequel slammer

178
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,900
yeah some I'm in the fortunate position

179
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,270
I know David Litchfield and he still

180
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,460
talks to this day about the horror of

181
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,229
when he got that phone call to say that

182
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,239
proof of concept she published has now

183
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,520
been used against everybody I think it

184
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,960
still gives him nightmares but in 2003

185
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,909
one the biggest and fastest spreading

186
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,430
worms in history hit the internet Lee

187
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,660
you know it ground various backbones to

188
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,210
a halt there's lots and lots of

189
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:02,450
organizations that lost service because

190
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,440
of slammer you the thought would have

191
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:08,150
learned something from that

192
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:12,410
yeah 2017 we had one a cry and not

193
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:15,590
picture Island 2016 we have the mirror I

194
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:18,710
bought so again will not learn in the

195
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:20,179
lessons of history and what and you're

196
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:27,530
I'd like to dig into why that is the

197
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:29,240
case so if it's not working what is it

198
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,130
that we're doing wrong and I think

199
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,650
there's a couple of things so if I'd go

200
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:36,230
through them feel free to heckle if you

201
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,449
think I'll you could disagree and then

202
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,830
as I go for each one I'll have a bit of

203
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,060
a explore of what maybe we can do to fix

204
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:46,450
that so to start off with

205
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:52,449
we are two key we love our cyber does

206
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:55,600
all the hype is extraordinary it truly

207
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,490
it truly horrifies me the things that

208
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,420
are in the press and in the papers that

209
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:03,010
our own industry are saying about cyber

210
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,079
don't get me wrong we've done some great

211
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:07,870
work I think it's really good that

212
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,120
stories about heartbleed and want to cry

213
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,920
and patch in actually make it to the

214
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,400
front of the BBC or on the nine o'clock

215
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,689
news do you make it into the red top's

216
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,610
that's not the problem I have the

217
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,100
problem is the message we send with

218
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,770
those we say over and over and over and

219
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,970
over again the sky is falling in it's

220
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,530
the end of the world

221
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,290
this next vulnerability is going to

222
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:30,540
bring doom and Armageddon to the world

223
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,790
and it never happens

224
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:37,209
there was a gent I hope he's not here

225
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:38,949
because I know he's relatively local was

226
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:41,110
quoted heavily I believe he was Miss

227
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:44,080
misreported but he was heavily quoted

228
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:46,270
for saying 2017 was going to be the year

229
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,540
a bank went bust because of a cyber

230
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:51,189
attack the amount of admin that created

231
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,170
make I instantly had the board on my

232
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:57,640
back Chris what do we have to do we

233
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:59,560
don't want it to be us but when are we

234
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:03,760
2019 and has a bank gone bust as a

235
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:05,680
result of cyber attack no we've had some

236
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,020
big incidents we've probably a lot of

237
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,689
instance over the years i doing 2017 was

238
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,780
particularly special it's just more

239
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:16,540
reported but we've not having one good

240
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:20,110
burst and my challenge with all that

241
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:22,180
kind of dazzle and Hyde is that we will

242
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,440
get to the point where our message will

243
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:27,609
no longer be heard a bit like yeah

244
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,930
calling out the Fox attacking the Sheep

245
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,940
and then you know all that kind of good

246
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,650
stories eventually they'll start to call

247
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,180
our bluff and say it won't happen and

248
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,650
that's when we'll have a really good

249
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,400
problem because we'll have missed our

250
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,980
opportunity

251
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,439
I think we've in a great place now the

252
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,970
interest is there I do have the board

253
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,740
phone me up quite regularly when they

254
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,150
see something in the paper and I quite

255
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,690
like that they do that I had this

256
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:50,890
interaction I don't like that the

257
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,330
Baroness at the Baroness has a hotline I

258
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,470
think she's got my phone number on speed

259
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,030
dial

260
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,170
and when she phoned me on Boxing Day

261
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,880
about

262
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,770
Specter a meltdown and that was an

263
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,280
interesting way to spend my Christmas

264
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,860
but we've got a great opportunity

265
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,170
because the interest is there I think we

266
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:12,910
now need to look and change how we talk

267
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:15,400
about cyber so when I'm talking to the

268
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,530
board I don't talk about sorry fast if I

269
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,260
could banish the word cyber I'd be a

270
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:22,569
really happy mountain because it doesn't

271
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:25,210
mean anything so when I talk to the

272
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,700
board and the execs and the regulators

273
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:30,340
because I'm in the fortunate position as

274
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,020
a CEO of a financial institute I have to

275
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,330
have a one-to-one with the regulator

276
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,520
every quarter and I don't just have one

277
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:38,650
regulator I've got two regulators in the

278
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,810
UK I've got one in Ireland I've got one

279
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,670
in Hongkong wanted Singapore you get

280
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,839
that you get the image and each day our

281
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,979
Chinese regulators will come and talk to

282
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,200
me about what we're doing on around

283
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,220
cybersecurity and I invariably annoy

284
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,290
them because the first minute able to

285
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,780
stop talking about cyber because it

286
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:55,540
doesn't mean anything and the way I

287
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,620
explain it to my executives is that we

288
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,920
need to start talking about the things

289
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,690
we care about so as a bank we care about

290
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,719
fraud we care about protecting our

291
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:06,940
customers money we care about ensuring

292
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,050
that customers can do transactions we

293
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,000
care about the availability of our

294
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:13,780
services as a result we care about our

295
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,880
intellectual property and to do all of

296
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,430
those things we use technology and

297
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,890
topknot technology can break and can and

298
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,209
will break sometimes that'll be because

299
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,520
someone designed it badly

300
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:27,040
I don't you fall over sometimes because

301
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,079
hardware fails and sometime it's because

302
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,949
someone took the dial and had a look to

303
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,630
see what happens if you turn it up to 11

304
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:36,640
but we need to talk about those attacks

305
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,870
that turning the dial to 11 or giving

306
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,380
them a good kick in or whatever we're

307
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:43,180
talking about in the context of losing

308
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,490
money because we care about fraud or

309
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,229
lose an intellectual property or our

310
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,060
ability or inability to deliver a

311
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,880
service as a result because that's the

312
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,530
outcome so I don't say to my my execs I

313
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,380
want another couple of million pounds

314
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:57,699
for a cyber thing I always put it in the

315
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,500
contest of I want a couple of million

316
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,660
pounds to reduce fraud against our

317
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,160
customers or I want another couple of

318
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,900
million pounds to ensure the

319
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,719
availability of this new service you're

320
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:09,590
building and then suddenly the context

321
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,120
is there it's nicely bounded

322
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:14,000
they get it because they're not

323
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,830
technical experts and then I have a much

324
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,450
better and informed conversation my

325
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:22,820
seniors and I'd love to see a lot more

326
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:25,670
of that in the wider community I also

327
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:28,310
get really irate within out of fear and

328
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,740
uncertainty and outlet guess but off you

329
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:33,140
wouldn't believe that as the number of

330
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:36,020
phone calls I got after wanna cry hit

331
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:38,449
the NHS I had company and company after

332
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,910
company phoned me up and say Chris

333
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:46,970
you're C so I can solve your wanna cry

334
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:48,230
problem which wanna cry problem and this

335
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,900
surprised how many companies think they

336
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,150
know my business better than I do

337
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,370
even though they've never spent any time

338
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:56,990
talking to anyone who works me so

339
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,580
there's a lot of sense selling that fear

340
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,930
by vendors I think we need to tackle

341
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,350
that I'll talk a little bit more about

342
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,349
that later

343
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:10,160
which kind of leads on to my second

344
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:12,770
point I believe and this is where the

345
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,360
industry you tend to lynch me I I

346
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:17,660
believe one of the problems we have is

347
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:20,480
we talk about security on its own we're

348
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:23,300
too busy selling secure widget a and

349
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,690
secure widget be and I think that worked

350
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:29,209
in the early days of the industry but it

351
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:31,580
isn't the solution going forward so I

352
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:33,260
get my vendors in nowadays and I don't

353
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:37,070
want to bind up a security product I

354
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:39,200
want to buy a secure solution so I think

355
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,610
the days of me buy of me working with

356
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,140
our tech my technology partners I'm

357
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:45,640
saying right so your boss you've bought

358
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:48,680
email right to secure email I now need

359
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:52,100
email scanner on the boundary I'll need

360
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:56,420
to put something else on the server I

361
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:58,340
need to roll out Demark and SPF and I

362
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,380
better do something about URLs so I'll

363
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:03,710
have a sandbox and Technol you get the

364
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:06,470
picture they buy email and then I buy

365
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:10,760
about two dozen solutions to make it

366
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:12,610
work securely or I can buy office 365

367
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,950
that does that all for me

368
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,540
it's a bit of a no-brainer so for me I

369
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,610
think we need to start talking about

370
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,469
stop talking about security in an

371
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,490
abstract way as a separate thing it's

372
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,320
not a separate thing anymore

373
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,180
it should be built into everything we do

374
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,950
we should be buying secure by default

375
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,989
products so all those people in chat

376
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,190
will be smiling because after a mantra

377
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:34,000
they've been raving about for quite a

378
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:35,440
few years but I generally believe having

379
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,950
sat there now and having to spend

380
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,210
millions of pounds on add-ons to make

381
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,790
stuff that the business want to use

382
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:47,920
secure isn't sustainable in the long

383
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:50,170
term and there's an example of this I

384
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,740
had a musing conversation it was about

385
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:55,000
my second week at the bank and I won't

386
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,520
that the company will remain nameless

387
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,130
but they're one of our big integrators

388
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,650
they run and as their systems for us and

389
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:05,439
they turned upon mass there was their

390
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:08,140
chief exact for this and their head of

391
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,460
widgets of that and and they came in and

392
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,080
they sat down with me and said you know

393
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:14,140
great to meet you Chris you're in the

394
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,300
bank we do all this wonderful stuff for

395
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:18,990
for the bank but we don't do any

396
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,219
security and we'd like to change that I

397
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:23,170
wish point the conversation took a real

398
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:25,090
nose dive because I just looked at them

399
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,069
out so you do all of this but you don't

400
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:29,830
do any security I think we need to

401
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:32,830
cancel our contracts because if you run

402
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,630
our solutions and you're not doing

403
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,310
security I'm sorry but you're not

404
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,870
meeting your contractual obligations I

405
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,339
wish when they kind of left the room and

406
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,690
they came back about a month later very

407
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,610
apologetic and said well here's all the

408
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,860
stuff that we do do but they were very

409
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:47,350
much seen security is a separate line a

410
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:49,180
separate thing they sold so they did

411
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,890
system integration over here and I had a

412
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,680
different security team that they were

413
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,390
trying to sell to me and I don't think

414
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,160
that's the answers if any ones we hear

415
00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:00,400
from a vendor and we just get away from

416
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:03,010
that separation of jobs they don't come

417
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:06,180
apart anymore we sell it as we here as a

418
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:08,440
secure solution here's we need to have

419
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:12,400
awful small space here we go

420
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:16,750
cool and this isn't just about our

421
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,920
technology as well and this is probably

422
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,760
the bit where I'm probably the most

423
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,890
controversial

424
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:24,579
well at least amongst my peers most

425
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:27,790
controversial the way we do security

426
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:30,110
overall is a bit broke

427
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:33,020
if somebody wants to deploy a new

428
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:35,389
solution in a generic company they have

429
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:37,160
to do a risk assessment they probably

430
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,900
need to do some pen testing they

431
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,270
probably need to fill out a risk form

432
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:46,070
they'll probably have to go through some

433
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:48,830
security gates we designed the processes

434
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:51,129
we have for doing security in a way that

435
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:54,139
actually gets in the way of the business

436
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:56,440
our job seems to be make it really hard

437
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,790
for the business and that is why

438
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,580
developers tend to not do security

439
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:03,260
because it's hard it's it's something

440
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,149
else on top of their day job that they

441
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,010
don't really want to do so we need to

442
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:11,240
get away from that there's a company in

443
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:12,440
Spain anyone who works for me will be

444
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,480
spire at this point because you're never

445
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:18,080
going anybody know what are

446
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,310
non-newtonian fluid is it's a few knotty

447
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,010
phases there we will give we have some

448
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,970
educated people in the room excellent

449
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:29,240
would you like to describe the

450
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:30,800
properties of a non-newtonian fluid yeah

451
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,510
they're harder the impact on a

452
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,270
non-newtonian fluid the more solid it

453
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:37,070
becomes custard is a really good example

454
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,379
if your filler if you watch Mythbusters

455
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:41,270
they filled a swimming pool with with

456
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,770
with custard and discovered you could

457
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,450
run across earth because the impacts of

458
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:46,340
your feet on the surface made it go

459
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,650
solid and you but as soon as you stopped

460
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,899
you sank into it so non-newtonian fluids

461
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:53,200
are this an interesting property as a

462
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,550
Spanish company they have taken that

463
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,050
filled what is in effect a very long

464
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,840
water balloon with it

465
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:02,180
and created a speed bump and by tuning

466
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,250
the fluid they've got to the point where

467
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,860
if you hit the speed bump at or below

468
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:09,290
the speed limit it just squashes out of

469
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,750
the way so you don't feel it it's not

470
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:14,450
there but if you go over the speed bump

471
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,580
it goes hard and you really feel a jolt

472
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:19,970
and I think that's what we need to do

473
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:22,280
with our kind of partners who design

474
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:24,290
technology our web developers our system

475
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,260
integrators we need to put processes in

476
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:28,820
place where security is invisible until

477
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,530
you do something wrong and then it

478
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,810
really hurts because at that point

479
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:35,120
security and doing the right thing is

480
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:36,830
the easiest route and if we can find

481
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,810
processes and technologies that enable

482
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,740
that suddenly everyone will do the right

483
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,780
thing because it's

484
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,150
painless whereas at the moment we do the

485
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,340
opposite we put lots of things in the

486
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:48,980
way we make security really hard to do

487
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:51,470
I assert at least or maybe it's just me

488
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:54,890
but typically if you're a developer

489
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:59,150
security gets in the way so I'm really

490
00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:00,800
keen that we change that we will still

491
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,770
need a security industry don't get me

492
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,928
wrong but I think it will change so at

493
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,280
the moment we try to be the leading star

494
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:10,010
on the stage we want to be the lead

495
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,770
vocalist of the band I think we need to

496
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:14,809
be a bit more like the car industry so I

497
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:16,730
remember and this probably show my age I

498
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:19,340
remember the days when my dad had to go

499
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:23,690
and have pay extra to have seatbelts

500
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:25,699
fitted to the car and the days when an

501
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:28,120
airbag was an optional extra and

502
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,040
anti-lock brakes were really expensive

503
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,139
but they're now all standard there's an

504
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,909
industry that does safety for cars but

505
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,250
we don't really talk about it it's just

506
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:39,650
features that we inherit when we buy a

507
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:42,710
decent car nowadays I think security

508
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:43,820
needs to go that way and then in the

509
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,530
industry side where we're looking at

510
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,899
those features I think we don't need to

511
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:53,720
start doing some basically some some

512
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:55,780
moonshot efforts to pop up a bear I

513
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,860
think we have to stop blaming the users

514
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,450
because to be honest to the blue if the

515
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,399
users aren't doing what we need it's

516
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,520
probably as much of our fault as it is

517
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,110
their fault I think we do stop playing

518
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,080
whack-a-mole so we're doing lots of

519
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:10,639
sticky plasters at the moment I think we

520
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,530
need to stop tackling all of the

521
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:17,090
symptoms and look at the underlying

522
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:22,210
issues so if I look at email first email

523
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:27,439
is invented allegedly in 1971 I think

524
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:29,390
the SMTP standard RFC 8 for 477 there's

525
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,500
that where's James Lynne when you need

526
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:36,590
him was in 1980 and we're still using

527
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,360
that and it's only insecure so I almost

528
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:40,340
take it as an insult on against the

529
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,040
technology industry that we're expecting

530
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:45,500
people to use unsecure stuff and then we

531
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,899
blame them when it all goes wrong so who

532
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,390
in the industry is reinventing email to

533
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,980
make it secure

534
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,870
who in the industry is working out how

535
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,660
we solve the identity problem

536
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,520
I kind of take it as a damn incitement

537
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,220
as a technology world that it's possible

538
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,570
to spoof an email address listen the

539
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,090
fact that it's possible to spoof a phone

540
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:06,649
number probably says more about us as

541
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,570
technologists than it does about the

542
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:11,150
users who fall for the tricks and scam

543
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,649
artists are pulling on them so I think

544
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,700
we as a technology that has been broader

545
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,500
than just security but I think as a

546
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:20,990
technology industry we need to tackle

547
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:22,549
some of those some of those issues my

548
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,140
next point is I think we over rely on

549
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:27,020
education I've talked about we blame lis

550
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:29,090
users too much some interesting

551
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:31,580
statistics and I can't claim the credit

552
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,199
for these there's a fantastic professor

553
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:36,100
at Portsmouth University called Debbie

554
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,950
Ashton Dunn and she shared these with me

555
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:41,510
did you know that 20 foot 20 to 30

556
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:44,780
percent of prescriptions and never

557
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:46,580
filled out that was news to me and there

558
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,540
was some research in the US and that

559
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:55,280
said in I think the research was in 2012

560
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:58,210
that identified that not following the

561
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:02,559
doctor's instructions resulted in

562
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:04,940
125,000 deaths per year in the US alone

563
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,559
so I look at those stars I go well if

564
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,960
people are willing to die because they

565
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,340
think they know better what's the odds

566
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,700
they're going to listen to little old me

567
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:16,570
about using a better password probably

568
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:19,580
I'll hide into nothing

569
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:21,980
so user education is really important we

570
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:25,340
can't just ignore it but I think we just

571
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:28,130
need to look at how we change that and

572
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:30,709
we need to reframe the conversation we

573
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:34,490
have between ourselves as experts in the

574
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:35,900
field and those who aren't in the

575
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:38,809
medical industry they've taken that

576
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,640
research and they're now looking at that

577
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:43,639
they don't call it but in effect it's a

578
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,220
a mutually agreed contract between the

579
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,980
doctor and the patient where they

580
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,140
jointly agree what the best course of

581
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,309
action is and by doing it

582
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,419
collaboratively so there's a

583
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:55,730
conversation between medical

584
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:58,640
professional and patient they've

585
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:00,890
discovered that they're more likely to

586
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,230
follow the advice I've been given so

587
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:05,659
what's what's our security equivalent of

588
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,800
that how do we have a conversation with

589
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:08,030
non specialists

590
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,190
that says here's the things you've got

591
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:12,770
to do so one of the things I do in the

592
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:15,920
bank is I have a conversation with our

593
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:17,930
staff and it's not necessarily protect

594
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,430
the bank but it's here's some good

595
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:21,620
things some good practice you need to

596
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,660
get into because it'll protect you at

597
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,120
home it'll keep your kids safe I don't

598
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,430
keep your own money safe and they'll

599
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,620
learn that and that's more of interest

600
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:33,620
to them and then those learned habits

601
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,629
kind of come to work with them and then

602
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,189
they do better things at work and we've

603
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,350
seen that those behaviors that that

604
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:42,380
approach to education is actually more

605
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:49,550
impactful than just saying don't do this

606
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:50,570
don't do that we've all sort of

607
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:55,399
recognize it's not just a technical

608
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:57,290
problem as well Google Chrome Google has

609
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,410
got a great blog post about a change

610
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:01,580
they meet at May to Google Chrome and I

611
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:05,150
use this quite a lot because it

612
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:07,189
demonstrates how when we design stuff we

613
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:12,950
need to think about how the human mind

614
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:14,930
works when you go to a site that fails

615
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:18,200
the SSL check you get an error page

616
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:20,930
don't you do they one noticed the change

617
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:26,300
in that error page about 18 months two

618
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:27,680
years ago mmm few knobs so what used to

619
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,480
happen we got and when you got an

620
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,880
encryption error used to for a big error

621
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,130
pager with lots of information and it

622
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,040
used to give you two options go back or

623
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:39,410
proceed anyway and what Google discovers

624
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,030
from their instrumentation was about to

625
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:43,640
first just over two thirds of users

626
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:45,800
would proceed anyway because you want to

627
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,140
see the dancing countdown you hear a

628
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:51,320
page in the way of you dancing cat

629
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:52,790
dancing cat wins so what they did after

630
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,070
a little bit of experimentation is they

631
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:56,780
changed that error message and they

632
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:59,929
reduce the amount of information it gave

633
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:02,000
you and more critically or more

634
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:05,750
importantly they changed the words on

635
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:10,190
the buttons so the buttons now say go

636
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:12,020
back to safety or advanced no customer

637
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:14,930
education they just change the words on

638
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,970
the buttons and now those numbers have

639
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:18,790
been reversed less than a third of users

640
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:22,330
do the dangerous thing

641
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:24,399
and that was just by playing to how

642
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,649
people think and doing that kind of

643
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,230
behavioral science behind the user

644
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:31,960
interface and had a huge positive impact

645
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:35,590
on the way people acted and behaved

646
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,270
online and as an organization we're

647
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,429
taking those lessons and we're trying to

648
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:40,629
apply them and it's early days for us

649
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:43,990
but we try to apply them to the way we

650
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:46,360
design our systems were trying to use

651
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:48,550
those in the way we write our letters to

652
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:53,709
our customers one of the big successes I

653
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:55,149
had was last year and please say I was

654
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:58,030
in the bank when we started paying a

655
00:26:55,150 --> 00:27:01,630
dividend again fantastic after many

656
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:03,820
years of making a loss and the success

657
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:06,280
for me was that the community the comms

658
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,350
team phoned me up out of the blue and

659
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,480
they said we're about to write to all

660
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:13,419
our shareholders because we need to know

661
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,700
their bank details so we can pay the

662
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:18,700
dividend but we want to do it in a way

663
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:21,820
that can't be thought is unlikely to be

664
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:23,320
abused by fraudsters so we had a great

665
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,540
conversation about things you could put

666
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,550
in the letter how your personalized us

667
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,440
how you put a reference how you loo

668
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,490
links back to our corporate website we

669
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,650
lost all the things we could pull

670
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:36,010
together to make that letter look as

671
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:37,960
genuine as possible and difficult for

672
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:39,460
someone else to then take and abuse it

673
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,770
wasn't perfect because at the end of day

674
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,930
we were writing to people but the fact

675
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:45,490
that the comms team saw that as an

676
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:47,350
opportunity that could be used as a

677
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:53,350
fraud and phoned me up I thought was a

678
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:56,100
bit of a success so moving on where are

679
00:27:53,350 --> 00:28:00,240
we up to 0.4

680
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:04,110
are you assert that behind a lot of

681
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,010
things we do and things that are deemed

682
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:10,799
industry best practice

683
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:10,799
there is just no science to back it up I

684
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:16,149
like the fact that Google did a post the

685
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:18,370
other day that said if you have to

686
00:28:16,149 --> 00:28:20,260
factor weakens your enabled we can see

687
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:22,918
you have less attacks if you have this

688
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,908
enabled so some real nice science around

689
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,909
passwords and two-factor authentication

690
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:32,049
backed up with hard evidence and

691
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:33,850
statistics but that's quite rare I mean

692
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:35,470
how many conversations do we have around

693
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:38,080
what's a good password and the bad

694
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:39,880
password where's the science behind it's

695
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,010
not how long it takes a computer to

696
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,639
crack it or what hash you use it's

697
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:48,100
bigger than that

698
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:50,799
I get audited regularly by our internal

699
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,840
audit and old Toyota you don't doing

700
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,450
user entitlement reviews that's bad I

701
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,699
don't go well that's fine that's your

702
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:59,860
opinion but where's the science to prove

703
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:03,730
that having that rolled out across all

704
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:05,260
of our systems will reduce our risks so

705
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,340
we're kind of in a bit of a strange

706
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,200
place where I think we're kind of into

707
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,809
12th century where there's some

708
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,029
perceived good behaviors we're kind of

709
00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:14,529
in the world of leeches if you keep

710
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:17,159
applying the leech you'll get better and

711
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:19,480
if you die well you were too ill anyway

712
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:21,519
and it's kind of like that with security

713
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,460
you need a firewall you need to use

714
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,830
micro segmentation you need to patch you

715
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,419
need to have five layers of protection

716
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:31,269
if you don't have five layers you're not

717
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:32,620
good enough but where is the evidence

718
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,630
where's the science where's our

719
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:39,189
double-blind testing there's a great

720
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:41,320
book called black box testin and it goes

721
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:44,169
through lots of examples from not from

722
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,629
medical industry and aviation and

723
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:48,970
engineering where it shows and explains

724
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:52,929
where a lot of perceived fault is

725
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:54,730
actually based on bad science just

726
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:56,740
because you did something once and the

727
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,909
problem got better it doesn't

728
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,769
necessarily mean that what you did is

729
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:03,070
the answer because it might have got

730
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:04,899
better anyway so we need to do more work

731
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:06,789
so when we are giving advice when we are

732
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:09,040
making decisions when I'm working out

733
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:11,080
where I spend my annual budget

734
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,480
I'm trying to avoid that those mistakes

735
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:16,809
and I we as an industry are a bit bad at

736
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:19,059
that at the moment so I across across

737
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:22,780
the bank I've got about hundred and

738
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:25,750
seventy things I measure month on month

739
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:27,820
that I really care about and as we make

740
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,679
investments we look to see what happens

741
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,350
to those figures and we see whether they

742
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,910
move in the right way or the wrong way

743
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:35,049
and we'll do some a/b testing

744
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:39,250
occasionally and we'll see what that

745
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:41,710
more how that alters our metrics and

746
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,390
then that helps me demonstrate the value

747
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:45,850
from the investments are making and

748
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:47,710
you'll be unsurprised to hear that we've

749
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:49,540
actually put some stuff in and then

750
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:52,179
taking it out because actually it made

751
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:55,210
no difference at all to our security

752
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:58,059
posture but I can evidence eart but I

753
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:59,590
don't think many people do that I've got

754
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:02,320
quite fortunate I've got quite a meaty

755
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:05,260
security budget you know 19 million

756
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,510
customers drives yeah some some some

757
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:10,120
some nice budget but how many other

758
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:12,669
companies who don't have a security team

759
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,469
of my scale and therefore can afford to

760
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:16,690
do that sort of thing how many are just

761
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:18,040
taking vendor assertions and just

762
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,720
throwing stuff in because it's been

763
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:23,320
asserted that that's industry good

764
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:25,270
practice so I'd love to see more science

765
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:30,580
around what we're doing that is

766
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:34,809
defendable and repeatable I kind of

767
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:36,730
related to that I don't know anyone work

768
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:38,139
for one of the big four couldn't you

769
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,690
maybe we don't want to admit a big for

770
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:43,260
consulting firms everything I can spot

771
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:47,169
you because you can't spin your head low

772
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:50,740
every one of those has a cyber maturity

773
00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:52,270
thing and they'll all sell it to me and

774
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,460
they'll come along and they'll have

775
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:55,870
their lists of stuff and they'll compare

776
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:59,070
me against that list and I'll get a

777
00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:00,699
number it's a Kris today you're a four

778
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,139
what does that mean

779
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,630
and then I'll go to some of the else and

780
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,770
go off sorry Kris you're a two and then

781
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:08,830
I'll go to another company go well

782
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:11,290
you're a free and it's not repeatable

783
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:13,750
which for me just proves that we need to

784
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:16,480
be more scientific around how we measure

785
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:18,429
cyber risk there's a great guy called

786
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,740
John Hubbard he's written a book called

787
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:22,330
how to measure anything it's all about

788
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:26,350
the quantitative measurement

789
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:29,500
of stuff and he in particular talks

790
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:31,779
about risk is absolutely often quite

791
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,480
fortunate that my chief operating

792
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:35,830
officer who seems to know everybody

793
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:39,039
knows John

794
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:40,539
so we're half looking at the work he's

795
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,740
done because I think that's the

796
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:43,960
direction we feel we need to have

797
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,220
quantitative measurement of risk I want

798
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,890
to get to the point where I can say to

799
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:50,890
my board the probability of losing

800
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:53,260
insert number is insert number percent

801
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:54,909
that's where I want to get to if you

802
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,649
care about losing ten million pounds a

803
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:58,840
year the probability of that happening

804
00:32:56,649 --> 00:33:01,059
because of security because of a

805
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,370
security of failing is this probability

806
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:05,918
and that's what I'm going to get to and

807
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:08,229
we're doing Monte Carlo simulations

808
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,360
within loads and modeling we're taking

809
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:14,139
lots of raw data feeding them the men

810
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:17,649
and seeing what happens but I'm a kind

811
00:33:14,139 --> 00:33:19,299
of a exception to the rule is anybody

812
00:33:17,649 --> 00:33:22,719
else doing that isn't indeed in academia

813
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:23,830
where is that oh fantastic there's a

814
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,429
couple of people doing that just

815
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,860
brilliant

816
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:29,679
but we're in the minority and when I

817
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,330
talk to other people about this I quite

818
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,250
often get glazed looks it's kind like

819
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:35,860
you're mad Chris you'll never get it to

820
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,940
work well at one point someone said

821
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,610
you'd be mad to put a man on the moon

822
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:41,679
but we achieved and we persisted someone

823
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:44,439
won so you never send yeah you never

824
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,659
invent medicines that you have cure

825
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,039
various illnesses but we did we

826
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:53,019
persisted and I think we as an industry

827
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:58,360
need to do more of that cool where we up

828
00:33:53,019 --> 00:34:01,870
to dead another Oh an amusing story so

829
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:06,399
we talked about measuring risk I saw a

830
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:10,330
great great great story from from the US

831
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:15,069
and I think was honest predicting that

832
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:16,779
things will fail the press I can't know

833
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:18,879
which President it was had asked the

834
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,220
intelligence agencies what's the

835
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:23,859
likelihood of this bad thing happening

836
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:26,080
it was for informing foreign and

837
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:27,609
military policy so they got a load of

838
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,649
intelligence analysts from all the

839
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:31,779
different agencies put them in the room

840
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:33,429
and they they kind of discussed the

841
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:35,510
topic the likelihood of this bad thing

842
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:37,639
happening

843
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:40,760
the end of it they all agreed they all

844
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:43,159
said it was very likely and that was

845
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,350
good well off to the president there's a

846
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:46,250
brief and very like yeah mr. president

847
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,618
what you care about

848
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:51,710
very likely it'll happen and that

849
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:53,659
informed this policy went on a few weeks

850
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:56,090
later one of the senators who'd been in

851
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:57,470
that briefing met the guy who did the

852
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:58,430
head of the analysis and he said it was

853
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,230
fantastic briefing

854
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:03,950
he said it's very likely just out of

855
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:05,510
interest there's a number what is that

856
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:09,230
is it lies did it very likely not 80%

857
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:10,880
85% and the hedonist no that's an

858
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,920
interesting question we never framed it

859
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,420
like that so they went back and they got

860
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,000
all the same analysts back in the room

861
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,680
again and they were all asked to put a

862
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,619
percentage probability on something bad

863
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:24,080
happening and it turned out they didn't

864
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:27,830
Talde agree agree apparently some people

865
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:29,990
thought 20% was very likely and some 495

866
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:32,270
percent was fairly likely but because

867
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:34,160
they'd use words rather than science and

868
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:36,230
kind of repeatable processors that

869
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,020
fallen into a false trap or thinking

870
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:41,420
they all agreed and I sometimes wonder

871
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,890
whether we're in the same boat so if we

872
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,150
can between strength and strength and

873
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:46,730
that kind of scientific approach that be

874
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:50,690
really good I am getting to the end

875
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:56,380
we've got some time to seem better my

876
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:58,400
next point is around professionalism I

877
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,960
don't think we've solved the

878
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,650
professionalism problem in information

879
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:08,560
security which kind of kind of saddens

880
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:10,670
me a little bit before I go into it and

881
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:15,410
for the people in Cheltenham I'm sorry I

882
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:18,020
am stealing somebody else's story slight

883
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:21,410
diversion does anyone know why planes

884
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:22,550
have round windows if you if you come

885
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,930
from Cheltenham we've heard the story

886
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:27,230
before you're not allowed to shout it

887
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:31,819
out anyone know why planes have round

888
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:33,600
windows yep distribute rest that's

889
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,930
absolutely right

890
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:42,299
but surprisingly the first commercial

891
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:45,180
airline airliner had square windows the

892
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:48,840
Havilland comet when it was first built

893
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:50,669
first commercial airplane arshad square

894
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:54,810
windows and it was a very successful

895
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:57,360
plane and then after a certain amount of

896
00:36:54,810 --> 00:37:01,110
time they start to disintegrate in

897
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:02,220
midair which is never a good thing when

898
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:05,430
you try to encourage commercial

899
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:08,100
commercial air flights and trouble and

900
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:10,140
stuff but what was interesting was not

901
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,839
so much that the plane lighter

902
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:14,940
disintegrate was more around what they

903
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,920
did as a result as will bring us full

904
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,350
circle

905
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:22,050
they built a water tank somewhere down

906
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:24,509
on the south coast big enough to surf

907
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:26,850
plane in it and then what they did was

908
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:29,370
they filled it with water and drained it

909
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:31,529
again and they repeatedly filled it with

910
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:33,779
water and drained it and what that did

911
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:36,450
was emulate the stresses on the fuselage

912
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:38,850
of changing in air pressure house as you

913
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,839
take off and land and they did this and

914
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,310
what they discovered I think was

915
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,970
something like thirty five thousand

916
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:47,640
cycles they started to sport hairline

917
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:50,689
fractures in the skin of the plane on

918
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:54,089
the score Taniya web square corner met

919
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:55,200
and at that point they can't realize

920
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:58,410
that that wasn't that had that had an

921
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,629
issue so what they did next was they

922
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:04,200
didn't care ound the fleet because

923
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:06,660
that's quite impactful is they put into

924
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,120
the maintenance manual something that

925
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,930
says every time a flight lands

926
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,730
particularly as it gets towards the

927
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:14,700
thirty thirty five thousand you need to

928
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:17,100
do an inspection of the corners of the

929
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,830
windows and if you start to see evidence

930
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:24,120
of micro fractures you need to replace

931
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:25,560
that bit of the fuselage and that

932
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,770
stopped the plane from disintegrating in

933
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:32,400
midair well they then did it was they

934
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:34,590
started to retrofit stuff to the planes

935
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,150
so they started to change square windows

936
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:38,310
for round windows one with the curved

937
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:41,100
corners which again solved the problem

938
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:42,450
and then further down the line it got

939
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,860
written into a standard that says you

940
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:46,109
never build a plane with square windows

941
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:47,680
so if you designed a plane today with

942
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:50,359
square windows

943
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,529
you probably get a struck off you know

944
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:54,440
you're not gonna be allowed to practice

945
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:56,630
engineering anymore you surly probably

946
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:00,800
end up being in jail for gross

947
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:02,599
misconduct and that for me is the

948
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:09,140
fascinating thing because if we go full

949
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:11,480
circle in 1917 whatever it was we have

950
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:14,089
1972 we had the first buffer overflow

951
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:17,030
but we still have engineer as software

952
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:19,640
engineers making the same mistakes we've

953
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:22,720
not learned from it if I go back to the

954
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:25,069
1960s and at about 2600 Hertz whistle

955
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,919
we're still making those same mistakes

956
00:39:25,069 --> 00:39:30,950
today so why is it in engineering

957
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,020
mechanical engineering we have a process

958
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:37,669
we have a system in place where people

959
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:39,020
qualify they learn a set of standards

960
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:41,540
and they are dear to them if you don't

961
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,650
do good practice if you don't learn from

962
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,720
the mistakes of the past

963
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:47,240
you get struck off and in some cases you

964
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,770
could end up locked away yeah for the

965
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,479
systems we built today which use

966
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:53,680
software we don't make we don't have the

967
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:56,750
same rigor you're not held to account

968
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,220
how many CISOs have lost it well I want

969
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,569
to have lots of job how many ceasers

970
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:03,049
have stopped in a sea circus I had a

971
00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:04,730
bridge now in some cases it can't be

972
00:40:03,049 --> 00:40:06,790
helped breaches happen and they always

973
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:10,130
will happen but some of them are because

974
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:11,869
stupid things were done but you just

975
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:13,069
move on to a different company if you

976
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:16,369
design a bit of software that's got a

977
00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:16,970
bug in it you just move on and you do

978
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:19,010
another one

979
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:19,970
and I'm not saying we need to get to the

980
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,109
point where just because you write a

981
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,189
book you lose your job

982
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:24,558
but I think we need to get to a point

983
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:26,660
where we have a set of standards that

984
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:28,040
help constrain what we do is you can't

985
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:29,990
design a bad solution we should be

986
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,690
designed in knowing that humans make

987
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:34,459
mistakes and part of that I think it's a

988
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:36,950
technology problem that we expect one

989
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:39,859
person to do everything I've got the

990
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:41,000
builders in at the moment and I really

991
00:40:39,859 --> 00:40:42,348
know what builds in the moment because

992
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,119
I'm stopa my wallet and they're helping

993
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:48,859
themselves every day but there's a

994
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,380
carpenter who knows how to work with

995
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:54,140
wood and there's a brick he who does all

996
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,480
the brick laying stuff there's a there's

997
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,150
a

998
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,760
a structural engineer who will tell them

999
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:01,260
what the you know how it needs to be

1000
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,720
designed to carry the weight of the

1001
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:06,359
building above it there's an architect

1002
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:09,089
or help with piecing all of that

1003
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:10,828
together there's there's probably some

1004
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:12,420
material experts will be able to say

1005
00:41:10,829 --> 00:41:15,089
well given the weight load and you need

1006
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,920
on that beam I recommend you steel of

1007
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:18,328
this thickness there's a quantity

1008
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,470
surveyor who pulls all the parts

1009
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:23,310
together make sure as I've got enough

1010
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:26,069
materials but we don't seem to do that

1011
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:28,470
in technology we think it's acceptable

1012
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:30,089
to have one person who's doing the

1013
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:32,549
security controls and writing the web

1014
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:33,810
interface and doing the code and

1015
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:36,349
probably looking after the operating

1016
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:38,609
system and configuring the firewall and

1017
00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:41,460
putting the rules on the content

1018
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:43,410
inspection etc I think we need to

1019
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:46,320
recognize that technology has to be a

1020
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:47,460
team game where each person plays to

1021
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,440
their strengths with a bit more

1022
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:51,630
specialism I think and we pull together

1023
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,640
multifunctional teams who then deliver

1024
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:56,940
an outcome and people held to account

1025
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:59,220
for the expertise they bring I think

1026
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,020
when we start to do that well then fast

1027
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:03,810
start to find out from an engineering

1028
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:09,540
perspective we will be much better

1029
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:11,400
delivering good secure solutions I said

1030
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,829
earlier analyst C so I have to speak to

1031
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:17,460
the regulator I'm held to account if I

1032
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:19,369
mess up I won't be allowed to be a C so

1033
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:21,780
in the financial sector again

1034
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:24,240
HR loved telling me there's an orange

1035
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:26,369
jumpsuit in my size

1036
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:32,700
that's really motivational in your media

1037
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:35,760
talk but it's true big companies will

1038
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:38,460
always have breeches but if I'm found to

1039
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,349
have been negligent because I didn't do

1040
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,109
something or because I lied or because I

1041
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:46,200
hid something I will be held to account

1042
00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:48,420
for that I will be fined I could go to

1043
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,279
jail and that's because I'm in the

1044
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,290
financial sector I don't think that's

1045
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,060
the same for all CISOs I think it

1046
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:55,680
shouldn't be that's not just because I'm

1047
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,270
suggested that regime I think it's cause

1048
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,399
of security professionals we should be

1049
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:01,790
held to account for the information we

1050
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,980
get and the guidance in our behaviour

1051
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:07,410
it's a scary fort when

1052
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:10,859
I was gonna mix up equifax had the

1053
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:13,410
breech yeah Zeca max there's lots of

1054
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:18,119
interesting chatter amongst kind of the

1055
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:20,368
seaso community around all US government

1056
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:22,470
are after the sea so they might they

1057
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:24,540
might it might actually file criminal

1058
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:27,419
charges against him and it was surprised

1059
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:29,640
at how many CISOs got really unnerved by

1060
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,750
that as a concept all of us in the

1061
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,910
financial sense were going well yeah

1062
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:35,579
that's yeah we thinking of us in our

1063
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:37,980
contract but it's not accepted across

1064
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:41,940
the industry I'd love to see more of

1065
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:44,280
that if I look in the medical industry

1066
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,530
there's the Hippocratic oath it says

1067
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,150
really good stuff like you know doctors

1068
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:50,310
swear to treat the ill to the best of

1069
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:52,170
their ability to preserve the patient's

1070
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:55,770
privacy teacher secrets of Medicine to

1071
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:58,980
future generations etc etc what's our

1072
00:43:55,770 --> 00:44:01,440
security info SEC equivalent of that I

1073
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,550
think we need one I can be really good

1074
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,589
if we had something like that I don't

1075
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:06,450
know what the answer is but you should

1076
00:44:04,589 --> 00:44:08,009
know a professional recognition which

1077
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:09,299
isn't just about your ability but your

1078
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:11,640
behaviors and what you'll do in the

1079
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:14,400
future on it is really important which

1080
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,480
is why I really like b-sides and I don't

1081
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,579
where Joshua is I'm not saying this

1082
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,319
justice I'm speaking of besides it's

1083
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:20,310
events like this that I think are really

1084
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:22,079
really important

1085
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:25,020
there's too many big commercial

1086
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:27,900
conferences set up to earn money for big

1087
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:29,369
nameless corporations I love these

1088
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,020
little conferences these are the sort

1089
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:33,210
things I'll come and talk to because

1090
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:35,250
this is where we share knowledge between

1091
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:38,099
ourselves this is the real practitioners

1092
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:39,480
learning from each other and it courage

1093
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:40,829
you to make the most of today and

1094
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,540
tomorrow

1095
00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:43,829
I'm gonna have a look at the weather

1096
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,509
well I don't where the car is the

1097
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:47,280
vehicle hacking thing about that looks

1098
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:48,240
awesome so I'm gonna go and broaden my

1099
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,829
knowledge there later

1100
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:54,750
I love besides enjoy the day I hope what

1101
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:56,369
I've talked about as being interesting I

1102
00:44:54,750 --> 00:45:00,960
haven't sent you to sleep it's been the

1103
00:44:56,369 --> 00:45:03,050
power point so enjoy the day and thank

1104
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,050
you

1105
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:15,140
any questions we've got their time give

1106
00:45:12,299 --> 00:45:15,140
it a jump neither front

1107
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:21,240
love the talk Thank You great you

1108
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:23,880
enjoyed it one question around metrics

1109
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:29,189
the reso metrics company I'll try not to

1110
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:31,020
name them whose metrics now take a lot

1111
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:33,630
of open-source feeds of information back

1112
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,920
companies and they've got to the point

1113
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:36,390
now where they're discussing the

1114
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,920
possibility of distinguishing in those

1115
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:39,299
whether the company's being audited or

1116
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,180
whether it's been breached from your

1117
00:45:39,299 --> 00:45:43,859
change in the metrics do you think

1118
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:45,779
there's going to be real visibility into

1119
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:47,220
companies like your own through that

1120
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:51,049
kind of technology and is that going to

1121
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:51,049
change the game in a positive way

1122
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:57,569
potentially there's a couple of

1123
00:45:53,789 --> 00:46:00,150
companies to do that in fact I think the

1124
00:45:57,569 --> 00:46:03,839
challenge I have with that is that as an

1125
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:06,900
external entity working without the

1126
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:09,630
cooperation that company you don't get

1127
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:12,240
to see what's behind the things you

1128
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:16,440
measure in so as an example there's one

1129
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:19,470
company that repeatedly gives me a

1130
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,510
really bad score and when we dig into it

1131
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:23,160
the reason why that happens is because

1132
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:26,250
they can't distinguish between our

1133
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:28,529
customer free Wi-Fi and branches and our

1134
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:29,789
corporate network there are different

1135
00:46:28,529 --> 00:46:32,789
addresses we've told them that's a

1136
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:36,539
difference but they but externally it

1137
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:38,160
just looks like hers and I know the same

1138
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:39,029
goes for the telco providers they have a

1139
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,980
real headache with some of those

1140
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:43,260
companies because customer behavior

1141
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:46,710
which isn't a reflection on them as a as

1142
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:48,930
a corporate entity often has a negative

1143
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:51,750
impact on their score so I think there

1144
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:53,220
is some value there but I think needs to

1145
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:57,059
be taken with a pinch of salt because it

1146
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:59,069
can be easily diluted by little mistakes

1147
00:46:57,059 --> 00:47:01,020
like that now if those companies are

1148
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:02,220
working in cooperation in the companies

1149
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,950
and they get the inside then there's

1150
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:08,339
maybe lots of value there's one that we

1151
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:10,680
use internally that look that tracks and

1152
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:13,349
sinkholes command and control for a

1153
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:15,149
malware and they use that as a way of

1154
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:16,250
identifying which companies have got a

1155
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:19,640
problem

1156
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:21,770
and we use it not just to check on us

1157
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,930
but to get a feel for what the state is

1158
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:25,190
for our customers because if we know

1159
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:27,560
that our customers been hit with a

1160
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:29,000
particular piece of malware or the UK

1161
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,980
he's been targeted by particularly smart

1162
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,290
the stuff we can do in response to that

1163
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:35,300
we can work with government and the

1164
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:36,890
other other entities as well as stuff we

1165
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,750
do ourselves so I think there is some

1166
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:39,920
value but I'm a little bit worried about

1167
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:47,900
whether it's actually the answer I think

1168
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:50,750
it's probably part the answer hi um when

1169
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,920
you say like you like keeping security

1170
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:55,160
in the background it should come with a

1171
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,510
product what are some in terms of

1172
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,129
integrated security into software

1173
00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:00,050
development life cycles what are some

1174
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:02,300
things like processes and methods that

1175
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:05,480
you endorse that you fan are pretty

1176
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:07,160
useful to do that and career results yes

1177
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,120
one of the things we're trying to do in

1178
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,310
the moment we're really struggling

1179
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:14,060
because the tools aren't very mature is

1180
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:17,299
we're looking at the end-to-end kind of

1181
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:20,690
software life cycle all the way from a

1182
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:24,050
product design through to doing your

1183
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:25,670
code into your test your pre prod tests

1184
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:27,920
and the deployment and we're looking at

1185
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:30,680
how we can hook security tools into each

1186
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,630
of those stages so one of the things

1187
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,270
we're doing yeah we do and I know many

1188
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:37,700
other companies now do we scan our

1189
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:40,160
source code repository so every time a

1190
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:43,160
developer checks something in it gets

1191
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:45,500
scanned at night and then that issues

1192
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:47,450
bugs back to the user and they can't

1193
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,750
merge there but they're there commit

1194
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:52,790
until it passes those scans and then

1195
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:54,770
when they do their first testing we'll

1196
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:57,290
tech know we're looking at how we can

1197
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:59,330
test with symbols and do automated

1198
00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:01,310
testing on those binaries because with

1199
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:03,319
the symbols compiled then it gives you

1200
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:04,940
more information and then when you come

1201
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,770
to do your next phase of testing we'll

1202
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:09,260
take that symbols out but we'll put it

1203
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:10,940
into over the container or a virtual

1204
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:14,240
machine that you want to deploy and then

1205
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:15,410
we'll scan that and then you can see

1206
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,540
there's you go along then we come to

1207
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,859
proc I don't need to pen tester because

1208
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,080
we've done all of these tests in the

1209
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:23,510
past and then our automated scanning

1210
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,819
kicks in and then anything that goes

1211
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:27,800
live on our estate is scanned regularly

1212
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:29,960
for known vulnerabilities and then on

1213
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:32,510
top of that that's where the red team

1214
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,770
the penetration testing comes in which

1215
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:36,619
means that developers can be really

1216
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:39,380
agile they can commit and develop as and

1217
00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:41,810
when they want we don't get in the way

1218
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:44,720
because we just we've bedded our checks

1219
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:46,910
so a vulnerability scale is just

1220
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:50,660
alongside you know of a compatibility

1221
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:52,399
test and it's just another gate they

1222
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:55,129
need to get through and that's my

1223
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,750
aspiration for the future the challenge

1224
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:58,940
is the tool sets for doing that aren't

1225
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:00,859
very mature at the moment so I think

1226
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:02,930
there's something around how we build

1227
00:50:00,859 --> 00:50:05,299
those products and work with the vendors

1228
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:07,098
who are in that space be they open

1229
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:20,619
source or Oroville eyes to see how we

1230
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:22,849
can make that better so the questions on

1231
00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:24,920
kernel metrics again so you mentioned

1232
00:50:22,849 --> 00:50:27,349
that when you get people to give a

1233
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:29,810
verbal description of risk it's kind of

1234
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:31,070
hard to baseline that and I was talking

1235
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:33,560
to a customer the other day about you

1236
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:35,500
know looking they wanted to put some

1237
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:38,180
additional security controls in but it's

1238
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,710
working out you can let the company have

1239
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,750
a go guessing what their single loss

1240
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:43,280
expectancy is but okay what's your you

1241
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:44,390
know reputational damage and that's you

1242
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,040
can pass the back to the board and say

1243
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:47,990
that you can work out how hard it's

1244
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,940
gonna hurt you if you get hit but the

1245
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:51,290
question of how likely you are for you

1246
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:53,839
know let's take the vulnerabilities for

1247
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:55,910
example how what's the what's the risk

1248
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:59,290
of you getting hit by you know either

1249
00:50:55,910 --> 00:51:01,129
women or zero-day but a newish

1250
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:03,410
vulnerability that you know you're

1251
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:06,020
struggling to get patched it's really

1252
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:08,118
it's really hard to get any decent sort

1253
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:09,770
of numbering on that so how do you it's

1254
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:11,210
not not necessarily for your business

1255
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:13,099
but how do you quantify the risk for say

1256
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:15,410
a you know a smaller company say it's

1257
00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:19,010
maybe 10 20 percent I think unless you

1258
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:21,799
and this we get some sort of scoring

1259
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:23,240
system against the score against the the

1260
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,310
implementation of security controls on

1261
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:27,919
the company but unless you marry that up

1262
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:30,920
with the actual results of when people

1263
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,990
do actually get rinsed the other way for

1264
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,550
me to one teams do telemetry they they

1265
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:36,770
know and stuff breaks like you

1266
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:38,150
you can't live stuff until you know when

1267
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:41,119
the break point is and then you can say

1268
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:43,640
right we can we can map the the controls

1269
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:45,950
implemented with the number of people

1270
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,180
that got owned from it and then you've

1271
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:48,379
got some date evening news but at the

1272
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:50,770
moment I'm trying to work out and you're

1273
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:53,990
lost expectancy with the customers right

1274
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:55,160
how likely is you're gonna get popped so

1275
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:57,348
I think that's how you calculate the

1276
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:59,359
loss the loss as a result of compromise

1277
00:51:57,349 --> 00:52:02,619
I mean there's a lot more data available

1278
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:05,240
now than there has been historically so

1279
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:06,770
I've got I've got a mix of experience

1280
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,750
Equifax

1281
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:11,030
you know they've now taken a write that

1282
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:13,220
right down on their risk credit score as

1283
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:15,859
a result of cyber breach so that has a

1284
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:19,160
material impact that you can measure if

1285
00:52:15,859 --> 00:52:21,680
you look at mask their write down was

1286
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:23,240
300 circa 400 million dollars I think as

1287
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,250
a result of not Petra attack I mean

1288
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,259
there's increasing amount of information

1289
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:30,109
and data points that you can look out to

1290
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:31,940
understand the impact and likewise we

1291
00:52:30,109 --> 00:52:36,170
trying to work out probability of you

1292
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:38,630
being popped I think you it isn't an

1293
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:41,089
exact science but I'm as we become more

1294
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:42,980
there's there's more visibility of

1295
00:52:41,089 --> 00:52:46,400
compromisers I think gives you more

1296
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:47,660
evidence so you I can tell you that if

1297
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,150
you prefer

1298
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:52,549
yeah I want to say how I know this but I

1299
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:54,290
if you refer to for example to miss

1300
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:56,180
configure your firewall and leave a

1301
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:58,970
vulnerable Hadoop cluster exposed to

1302
00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:01,700
Internet it was two minutes before it

1303
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:03,500
was compromised that's a useful fact

1304
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,779
that you can feed into your model in

1305
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:08,089
that vulnerable software with an

1306
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:12,109
external visibility gets hit very very

1307
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:14,180
quickly and I've sat there idea Isis

1308
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:16,880
build up an AWS instance and I just kept

1309
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:18,529
repeating it you know but a vulnerable

1310
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,290
service expose it to the Internet and

1311
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:22,700
sure enough on average it was about two

1312
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:24,560
two-and-a-half minutes from being hurt I

1313
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:28,399
think you can do those experiments now

1314
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:30,259
to give you a gauge for likely hurt you

1315
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:36,680
can work out you know size of a company

1316
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:39,589
I know you for our email boundary we we

1317
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:41,180
stopped about 80 some percent of all

1318
00:53:39,589 --> 00:53:42,440
emails we just dropped them at the

1319
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:44,750
boundary we never ever delivered them to

1320
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:46,790
a member of staff so that again gives a

1321
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:49,369
gives us a sense of scale of how much

1322
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:50,779
malicious stuff is hitting our external

1323
00:53:49,369 --> 00:53:52,729
boundary I

1324
00:53:50,779 --> 00:53:55,489
can tell you of the eleven and a half

1325
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:57,379
billion web requests we make every month

1326
00:53:55,489 --> 00:54:00,829
I can tell you exactly how many of those

1327
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:04,579
we identified malicious content erm and

1328
00:54:00,829 --> 00:54:07,849
again that feeds into a likelihood so we

1329
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:11,509
can you know it's not exact science but

1330
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:14,179
it's better than some medium which is

1331
00:54:11,509 --> 00:54:16,519
what we tend to do at the moment and

1332
00:54:14,179 --> 00:54:19,249
over time we just need to refine it and

1333
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:22,069
get more data and that's why I've got a

1334
00:54:19,249 --> 00:54:25,578
lot of respect for the mask see so

1335
00:54:22,069 --> 00:54:29,019
because in the right forums he's been

1336
00:54:25,579 --> 00:54:32,179
very very open about how they were hit

1337
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:34,879
what the impact was what they've had to

1338
00:54:32,179 --> 00:54:36,859
do to get out and can't get around that

1339
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:40,339
and what it's meant for them as a

1340
00:54:36,859 --> 00:54:41,359
company and to have I think it's not you

1341
00:54:40,339 --> 00:54:43,038
know it's not being talked about

1342
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:44,808
publicly but in the right forums among

1343
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:47,900
CEOs and other security professionals

1344
00:54:44,809 --> 00:54:49,729
that's a fantastic reference point we

1345
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:51,439
can now go back to and say okay this is

1346
00:54:49,729 --> 00:54:55,158
what it means when a large corporation

1347
00:54:51,439 --> 00:54:56,390
gets hit the norsk hydro again we can

1348
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:58,099
look at that there's a lot of examples

1349
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:59,629
about what happens we've run somewhere

1350
00:54:58,099 --> 00:55:01,819
you know they have to stop production

1351
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:03,609
for a number of days you can see what

1352
00:55:01,819 --> 00:55:05,779
that means in terms of material impact

1353
00:55:03,609 --> 00:55:07,489
we just need to collect that sort of

1354
00:55:05,779 --> 00:55:09,650
information and put it in a big melting

1355
00:55:07,489 --> 00:55:13,189
pot it won't be a hundred percent

1356
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:15,469
accurate but I think I assert and I'm

1357
00:55:13,189 --> 00:55:16,819
happy to be proven wrong that that's

1358
00:55:15,469 --> 00:55:18,559
better than what we're doing at the

1359
00:55:16,819 --> 00:55:20,808
moment and as long as we're getting

1360
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:23,119
better a year on year then we're heading

1361
00:55:20,809 --> 00:55:30,919
in the right direction sounds the

1362
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:32,419
question kind of anyway look your aren't

1363
00:55:30,919 --> 00:55:35,390
going to be it for questions okay

1364
00:55:32,419 --> 00:55:36,348
however as with any of the talks we're

1365
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:38,299
going to be trying to keep to the

1366
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:40,939
relatively tight schedule but there's a

1367
00:55:38,299 --> 00:55:42,229
speaker meeting area that's just through

1368
00:55:40,939 --> 00:55:45,288
the way and we'll be encouraging and

1369
00:55:42,229 --> 00:55:46,640
asking speakers to meet with attendees

1370
00:55:45,289 --> 00:55:48,739
people who are further questions after

1371
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,939
the question period then so Chris thank

1372
00:55:48,739 --> 00:55:51,619
you very much thank you for coming and

1373
00:55:49,939 --> 00:55:53,919
sharing your insights with us if you'd

1374
00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:53,919
come
