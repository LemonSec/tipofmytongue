1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:09,780
so today I will introduce to you my work

2
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:18,509
in statistical security for Internet of

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:24,479
Things actually I'm a first year PhD

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:27,749
student and this is my work so far so

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,499
first we will introduce the IOT security

6
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:36,108
problem and after that we will introduce

7
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:43,309
the motivation behind our work and then

8
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:46,079
we will introduce what we we did so far

9
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:52,078
so as we can see the IOT security

10
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:55,649
problem is an emerging problem nowadays

11
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,280
because of first the total number of

12
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:06,120
active IOT devices connected worldwide

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:12,720
is expected to increase by 22 billions

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:17,280
by 2025 so what's the problem of that

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:21,570
the problem that we have a very poor IOT

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:25,380
security measures especially in the IOT

17
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:31,280
devices we use in the high-density

18
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:35,729
applications so as we can see we have

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,880
90% of the devices collects 90% of the

20
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:43,140
devices collected at least one piece of

21
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,339
personal information and also 70% of

22
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:52,140
devices used and encrypted natural

23
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:56,930
service 70% of the devices along with

24
00:01:52,140 --> 00:02:01,320
their cloud and their apps enable an

25
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:04,470
attacker to Untied enta phi a valid user

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,478
accounts and 80 % of the devices along

27
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:12,840
with their cloud and mobile applications

28
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:16,099
fail to require password of sufficient

29
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:20,799
complexity and

30
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:24,649
also a recent research showed us that

31
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:27,799
there is 25 vulnerabilities in the most

32
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:34,540
10 used IOT devices in the world

33
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:38,540
so all these vulnerabilities ly lead to

34
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:40,970
a lot of IOT security incidents in the

35
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:44,030
recent years as we can see from the

36
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:52,220
chart developed by the cyber threat

37
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:59,359
report in 2019 that in 2018 the cyber

38
00:02:52,220 --> 00:03:01,489
attacks increased by 200% than the cyber

39
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:06,620
attacks in 2017

40
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:10,519
which is a really very big number we can

41
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:14,780
remember the ransomware attack happened

42
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:20,269
in the NHS and cause the NHS to lose

43
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:29,780
like 63 billion pounds in order to fix

44
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:33,709
and to install high security devices are

45
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:37,040
along the NHS and the funny thing that

46
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:39,680
third of the devices infected by the

47
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:45,470
ransomware where IOT devices used in the

48
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:52,489
health sector and also we can remember

49
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:58,310
the famous Mirai attack which is which

50
00:03:52,489 --> 00:04:01,909
happened in 2016 and led to most of the

51
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:07,299
East Coast most of the East Coast in the

52
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:10,879
u.s. lost its connectivity to the most

53
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:17,150
popular internet service providers like

54
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:21,380
Amazon and Facebook so the me right

55
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:26,120
button it was a distributed denial of

56
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:28,560
service attack and it used along with

57
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:32,760
routers it used

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:37,980
CCTV cameras which the problem with CCTV

59
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:45,300
cameras it it has a default password and

60
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:49,169
user name used with it so as we can see

61
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:52,830
from this chart that the traffic this is

62
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:58,469
one of the the traffic in the affected

63
00:04:52,830 --> 00:05:09,750
companies with Mirai in 2016 and we can

64
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:11,910
see here we can see here the normal

65
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:26,910
behavior we can see here a low traffic

66
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:32,760
and there are several attacks and there

67
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:39,930
is several attacks up to two hundred and

68
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:43,919
fifty gigabit per second so if we had a

69
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:47,490
mechanism to in the IOT device itself in

70
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:57,090
order to know that this device is

71
00:05:47,490 --> 00:06:00,990
behaving abnormal is not behaving in a

72
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:04,530
normal way so we can and then we have a

73
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:11,630
mechanism to block this device then we

74
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:21,419
can we could save we could save like

75
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:23,760
millions or yeah so what is the solution

76
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:25,859
the solution one of the solution for

77
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,139
this is not the only solution of course

78
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,350
one of the solution is anomaly detection

79
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:34,710
and as we can see the an animal

80
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:37,280
detection is to find the anomalous

81
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,280
behavior

82
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:54,360
at to find the anomalous behavior of of

83
00:06:47,180 --> 00:07:01,230
one dimension at some points and then to

84
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:03,840
the key to declare anomaly so so to to

85
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:06,900
have the anomaly detection we should

86
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,049
know the normal behavior and then we

87
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:18,690
could know if there is anything go wrong

88
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:21,630
with in anytime after that so what is

89
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:32,280
that challenges for IOT for anomaly

90
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:34,680
detection in the IOT set up so the f-101

91
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:39,179
challenge is the anomaly detection in

92
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:41,820
the high-density IOT in our networks in

93
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:45,270
the massive IOT because we are using low

94
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:49,650
cost and low energy and massive numbers

95
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:52,320
of IOT devices so what happens that we

96
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:56,750
have low cost and low energy devices so

97
00:07:52,320 --> 00:08:00,690
we could not do very complicated

98
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:05,540
security measures at the device end and

99
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:09,210
also we have a very high number of

100
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:13,980
devices used massive numbers so this

101
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:16,739
mean a very huge data we should process

102
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:24,930
in order to know the normal and then the

103
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:28,550
anomalous behavior so in order to make

104
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:32,130
the sorry in order to make this problem

105
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:39,080
simple we want to develop a distributed

106
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:42,620
IOT IOT anomaly detection method that is

107
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:47,910
not complicated not computation

108
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:51,120
computational complicated and also it

109
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,540
can be done in the device and so it can

110
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,470
use

111
00:08:51,540 --> 00:09:01,939
the device data only and it doesn't need

112
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:12,480
to use the other devices in the network

113
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:18,510
data so the problem with that is the

114
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:22,050
modeling of the normal and anomalous

115
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:25,050
behavior of the IOT device we can see

116
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:28,079
from the charts here we have the normal

117
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:30,750
behavior and the anomalous behavior on

118
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,630
the other side the normal behavior we

119
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:37,830
described the number of packets per

120
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:43,080
second in one day for this device is a

121
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:51,260
motion sensor we took this data from we

122
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:55,100
have them we have the the data source

123
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,100
downside so

124
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:15,330
as we can see here the volume of the

125
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:17,640
traffic is is not high in the first in

126
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:21,150
the first chart and it is very high in

127
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:25,920
the second chart but it is very bursty

128
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:30,260
that means we have the number of packets

129
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:36,209
sent per second by the motion sensor is

130
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:39,600
from 0 up to 80 packets per second and

131
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:42,180
in the other side in the normal behavior

132
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,410
it is from 0 to 20 packet packets per

133
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:50,430
per second and as we can see we cannot

134
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:54,360
if we want a real-time detection for for

135
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:57,839
this scenario we cannot fix like I mean

136
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:02,370
and said if it is above this mean then

137
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:08,640
we have anomalous behavior or rum if it

138
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:12,480
is down this mean we have a normal

139
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:19,400
behavior so we should characterize as as

140
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:24,690
well the inter arrival time and also the

141
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:31,319
the number of packets sent per second

142
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:35,790
that together so as we can see from the

143
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:39,210
two challenge challenges we described we

144
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:43,230
described before we need a real-time and

145
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:44,460
a distributed algorithm which is not

146
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:50,450
very complicated

147
00:11:44,460 --> 00:12:00,150
and we need also to use oh we don't have

148
00:11:50,450 --> 00:12:07,550
we need to use we we need to use not a

149
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:12,780
high volume of data so the IT security

150
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:16,979
suggested scheme the first we so this is

151
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:18,180
our word is a statistical solution this

152
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:24,420
the first

153
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:31,260
so this is done this is the number of

154
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:33,390
packets sent to each IP this is the

155
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,790
number of packets sent to each IP

156
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:39,390
address in the first chart we can see

157
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:42,990
the IP address here is the IP address of

158
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:47,430
the gateway which has the highest number

159
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:51,900
of packets sent and in the second chart

160
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:58,829
where where is the attacked traffic we

161
00:12:51,900 --> 00:13:00,870
have lots of other IP addresses and you

162
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:06,210
can see that this is not the normal

163
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:11,360
behavior from this chart so what what is

164
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:11,360
our solution our suggested solution is

165
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:46,040
so our suggested solution is do the Q

166
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:50,220
modeling for the income traffic first we

167
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:54,510
get we cluster their income traffic into

168
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:56,880
different packet sizes and each packet

169
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:59,880
size we have a stream of traffic we

170
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:04,740
enter it into a queue that have a

171
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:08,790
service time which is greater than the

172
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:14,490
the mean Araya mean arrival time of the

173
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:18,000
packet and then from this we can model

174
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:24,200
the delay or the queue size you can see

175
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:29,780
the chart down you have the queue size

176
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:34,110
per second as and as you can see it is

177
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:40,530
coming up and going down depending on

178
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:44,610
the number of packets sent per second so

179
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:46,079
we can see the difference between the

180
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,050
normal behavior and the animal's

181
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,360
behavior when we use our methods so in

182
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:56,719
the normal behavior you can see that the

183
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,720
keel is building up and emptying and

184
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:04,800
within a certain range and for the for

185
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,360
this type of attack

186
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:12,449
this view is building up infinitely and

187
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:16,970
as you can see we set up a threshold

188
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:20,700
so after this threshold we assume that

189
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:31,070
every point after exceed this threshold

190
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:37,560
is is regarded anomalous point and so an

191
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:39,450
attack can be declared how we can choose

192
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,060
the throw shot becomes to the threshold

193
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:48,610
off from the complimentary CDF

194
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:52,209
the delay will be modeled earlier so

195
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:55,630
what we did is for for 30 days we have a

196
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:59,760
complimentary CDF for each day and from

197
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:03,130
this complimentary CDF we set up a

198
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:08,020
reasonable threshold and then we have

199
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:12,220
the mean for 30 days and as you can see

200
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:18,130
when we set up the threshold it was in

201
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:26,350
this case 1 1250 we declared an anomaly

202
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:29,740
in 700 7000 seconds and it was 2,000

203
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:35,830
seconds later than the actual attack so

204
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:39,060
we can we can always reduce the

205
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:45,580
threshold so we have an early detection

206
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:49,060
but there is a trade-off between the

207
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:55,270
early detection and a false positive

208
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:59,020
alarm still in some cases yeah so the

209
00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:01,780
future work is to develop simultaneous

210
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:04,420
fuse for different package sizes so in

211
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:07,210
our analysis we used just one stream of

212
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:12,190
packet size which was the for the TCP

213
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:14,020
protocol in for our IOT device and also

214
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,940
reducing the difference between the

215
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:19,060
detection and the actual attacks are by

216
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:22,510
selecting optimum threshold updating

217
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:28,139
threshold to his time so because we know

218
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:31,300
that the behavior of IOT devices is not

219
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:34,210
uniform in most cases like for example

220
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:41,260
in the motion sensor or in the IP

221
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:44,970
cameras or so we have a normally heavier

222
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:49,420
that changes with this time slightly and

223
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:53,110
also we are starting to develop our own

224
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:58,230
testbed and assess the real-time

225
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:58,229
application of our algorithm thank you
