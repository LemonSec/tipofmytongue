1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,790
yeah my name is Dan Pittman I work for

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:10,430
that logic as a an architect doing

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,349
various things cloudy staff and Scootie

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,700
stuff obviously so I'm gonna have little

5
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:15,349
talk about threat hunting and some of

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,590
the practical stuff that we do within

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:21,169
our research team and our soccer teams

8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,730
so obviously starting off with a sort of

9
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:23,810
definition or at least talking about

10
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,070
what the difference is and there's only

11
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,779
one difference as far as we're concerned

12
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,220
right between detection and hunting and

13
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:30,710
that's where there is known and unknown

14
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,910
threats detection obviously you know

15
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,410
what you're looking for and you can

16
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,420
write good signature and it's nicely

17
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,830
tuned and so on and so forth whereas

18
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,700
hunting you know you may not know what

19
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,410
you're looking for you're trying to find

20
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,270
stuff that's unknown but you still need

21
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,589
to kind of know which bits you might

22
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,880
want to look for something to search for

23
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,270
and I kind of kind of talked about that

24
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,460
a bit today obviously if anyone

25
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:52,370
disagrees you can not ask any questions

26
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,350
later maybe posted on YouTube so look

27
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,150
let's set the scene right so this is the

28
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,530
way we see security is that you've got

29
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,030
some really highly trained people in the

30
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,200
middle and they're you know you've been

31
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,550
training them for ages and they're

32
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,810
really highly specialized but you

33
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,699
haven't got very many of them normally

34
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,290
and then you've got a bucketload of

35
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,179
attacks happening right because a lot of

36
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,280
most attacks these days that we see in

37
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,890
our socks and we run a a sock has about

38
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,870
4,000 customers we have a lot of data we

39
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,870
see a lot of attack attempts and some

40
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,310
attack success and you know that water

41
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,570
mation that drives those attacks is

42
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,130
what's the biggest challenge really and

43
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,199
so I'm going to talk a little bit about

44
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,149
why automation is critical for threat

45
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,920
hunting even though obviously that

46
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,060
people are still are still critical so

47
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,890
where do those things go we've got our

48
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,630
school team we've got some attacks that

49
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,190
we were able to thwart but still we've

50
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,420
got these inbound threats right and

51
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,770
generally speaking you're getting

52
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,020
overwhelmed a lot at the time especially

53
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,190
if you run out a small stock and you've

54
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,140
got a lot of data or you've got large

55
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:46,340
Maya systems to manage it can be very

56
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:48,380
difficult and just a switch stalls

57
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,540
program you know what we want to build

58
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,720
is our nice analytic defense right so

59
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,820
see the good guys here and it gets a bit

60
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,380
confusing thanks to George but building

61
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,789
that analytic defense of building your

62
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,740
clone army is going to be important

63
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,360
right because you can know some of what

64
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,280
you're going to look for and ultimately

65
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,990
digging through all that data can be the

66
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,090
biggest challenge so what's that

67
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,519
analytic defense automation look look

68
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,049
like you want to match the behavior in

69
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:13,489
the techniques the attackers necessarily

70
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:15,260
not looking for a specific thing in a

71
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:16,010
signature you know can be relatively

72
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,390
trivial to do

73
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,040
at times if you've got a known attack

74
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,059
and I'm going to talk about that but

75
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,040
they're different ways to apply that

76
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,530
automation that's like I says the core

77
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,720
difference industrialization of

78
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,549
attacking is a very real thing now we've

79
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,129
got countries where unemployment is very

80
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:32,599
high around the world and there they

81
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:34,518
have teams of people that are probably

82
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,730
more organized and some of the companies

83
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,400
I've been in to see running as attacks

84
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,140
and passing things around the world and

85
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,000
attacking our our customers and so we

86
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,980
really need to make sure that we can

87
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,620
find these things so we talk about a

88
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:52,459
known attack and this is the shot with

89
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:55,220
bug from 2015 it was relatively easy to

90
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:56,540
find right so we had we knew that the

91
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,129
content we were trying to look for we

92
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,420
knew to look for this admin HTML and

93
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:02,390
forwarded equals we can look for that

94
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,488
and within the URI there was a community

95
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:07,099
rule out I was a bit more tuned and this

96
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:08,510
tool obviously so you know if you know

97
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:10,879
if you see these things then that's the

98
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,290
attack being attempted and you know you

99
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,910
need to go and dig into the data and

100
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,650
that that can be quite an easy thing for

101
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,569
someone to do in their sock right you

102
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,160
take the community rule maybe you tuned

103
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:20,899
it a little bit you build it into your

104
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,989
IDs and you escalate it to someone who

105
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,430
knows what they're doing

106
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:27,139
but threatening is different right

107
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,870
it's about finding what you don't know

108
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:31,160
like I say it's not the same as zero day

109
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,569
hunting of zero day something there

110
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,340
isn't a patch for but what we're trying

111
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:36,560
to do here is find stuff that before

112
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,209
hits the public domain so one of our big

113
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,919
success stories in that case was one a

114
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:41,599
cry week downloaded the shadow brokers

115
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,910
packet we were looking at it months in

116
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,168
about a month and a half in advance able

117
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,880
to understand what was going on our

118
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:47,959
customers were protected from that I'm

119
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,400
not going to go on about one or try

120
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:53,269
today obviously everyone's talked about

121
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,620
one across forever so one of the key

122
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,900
things though is the automation is

123
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,030
pervasive within all of it right don't

124
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,280
it sort of labor on the differences but

125
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,260
definitely you need your own clone army

126
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,669
of things to try and find things out and

127
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,349
you can use automation in both of these

128
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:10,190
cases but we're going to focus on threat

129
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:11,540
hunting today obviously so what you need

130
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,370
to do to prepare right you need

131
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,798
something you need obviously need data

132
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:17,120
right so if at star wars now we've got a

133
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,400
lot of the rings I'm not going to do

134
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,810
Harry Potter don't worry and your

135
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,880
automation is only as good as the data

136
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,349
you've got I would say right so we have

137
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,909
a lot of data one of our cheesy snacks

138
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:27,130
we throw around we've got bit we've got

139
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:28,990
more data than Netflix

140
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,610
and that's the quantity of data when

141
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,590
you've got a large sock 4,000 our

142
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,420
customers as I said the amount of data

143
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,820
that you collect even just our event

144
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,440
data that alone log data is massive and

145
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,960
so our challenge to sift through that

146
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,090
and get into it is a really big deal for

147
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,530
us and that's why we need more ember

148
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,270
smoke tools we need very very clever

149
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,119
people working in our research teams and

150
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,010
our our sock and that automation is

151
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,780
critical so what are we looking for in

152
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:56,170
that data there's some obvious things

153
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:58,059
right source IP destination IP etc we've

154
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,460
got a sort of generic payload on on the

155
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,470
right on your right and we're gonna

156
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,599
focus on this payload body and the URI

157
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,950
today but you know for that known attack

158
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,990
we know what we're looking for we know

159
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,539
we're looking for things in the RI we

160
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,620
can find out very easily but when we're

161
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,600
doing threat hunting we don't

162
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,040
necessarily have that luxury we might

163
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,810
know some little bits here and there you

164
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,340
know the admin HTML being here it might

165
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,780
give us a clue but obviously that's

166
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,039
gonna throw up a ton of false positives

167
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,109
because that's hid when people are doing

168
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,930
administration against that against that

169
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,480
system perhaps so you want to collect a

170
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,250
lot of data and but why not all the data

171
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,370
right so there's a few reasons for them

172
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,650
I love this this tweet ages ago by by

173
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:38,140
James and kind of highlights why Big

174
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,549
Data isn't this of panacea to everything

175
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,870
one of the big reasons for not

176
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,010
collecting all the data or at least

177
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,500
trying to manage the data properties

178
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,510
cost there are some vendors who entire

179
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,280
strategy is based on pH we're selling to

180
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,960
people run seam tools and want to keep

181
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,090
swishy financial organizations will want

182
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,669
to keep their data forever or at least

183
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,380
seven years and so that means a huge

184
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,820
amount of data being stored don't

185
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,900
necessarily want to compress it cuz

186
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,370
obviously that takes longer if you want

187
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,190
to go to back and do post instant

188
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,630
analysis if you do collect a lot of data

189
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,950
then you need to do some good stuff with

190
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,780
it right you need to normalize it you

191
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,310
need to know that the timestamps are

192
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,479
normalized between different systems

193
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,040
maybe they're in different parts of the

194
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,020
world or that just drifted a little bit

195
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,480
so you need to do that and obviously you

196
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,830
need to categorize right if you want to

197
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,840
search you know data and this is a big

198
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,950
challenge for us than just searching

199
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,169
carte blanche throughout your entire

200
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,340
data set will take a long long time so

201
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:28,330
you want to be able to categorize that

202
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,919
and look for specific things and that's

203
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,539
the kind of thing you know you can do

204
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,220
with increasing volumes and diversity of

205
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,500
data is making sure you categorize and

206
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,430
normalize appropriately so what strings

207
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,290
can we pull out there's some obvious

208
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,449
ones right and boring stuff like source

209
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,469
IP and destination IP source

210
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:42,879
he for us is one of those interesting

211
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:44,800
things because obviously we all know

212
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,960
that keeping IP reputation has a

213
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,610
diminishing kind of return on investment

214
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,289
because attackers shift IPs

215
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,629
but it's much better than to try and

216
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:54,370
look for their the IPS that are in there

217
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:55,479
controlling infrastructure we think

218
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,270
about if you saw my talk yesterday

219
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:59,438
talked about the dropper systems the

220
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,909
infrastructure that they're managing

221
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,990
that will host the web shell or host a

222
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:03,159
piece of malware that they pull down

223
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,139
when they're doing a remote code

224
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:06,370
execution that's unlikely to shift you

225
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:09,909
know that's going to have a more static

226
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:11,229
IP not completely static obviously but

227
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:12,520
they might use a domain or something

228
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:13,960
like that we can keep track of those

229
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,400
things rather than looking for the

230
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,779
specific attack right because that's

231
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,758
just going to change all the time and

232
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:20,650
there's other bits and pieces you know

233
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:23,650
like the head in the headers Apaches

234
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:26,620
flats is quite a common one for look for

235
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,299
in headers and so on user age and

236
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,589
obviously they can spoof this but you

237
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,930
know you can often tell if they're not

238
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:33,699
particularly bright whether they're

239
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,979
whether they're automating things we're

240
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:39,159
going to focus on payload body for some

241
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:40,539
of the examples I've got we find it

242
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,770
definitely to be generally they're more

243
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:43,180
useful when you're looking for a taxi

244
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,589
looking you're doing threat hunting

245
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,139
because it contains the richest amount

246
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,520
of information and this is where that

247
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,659
expertise comes in right this is where

248
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,580
some of the guys they're here today from

249
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:53,919
our sock really add value to us because

250
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,438
they're able to dig into this data and

251
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,909
understand and start to tree out as far

252
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:59,289
as where they need to look and start we

253
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:00,789
can start to return that information

254
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:02,770
back into our research and content teams

255
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:04,899
to generate what we would call telemetry

256
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,399
signatures or more wideband signatures

257
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:08,020
to pull in more data to do some great

258
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,050
threat hunting so I'm going to talk

259
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,520
about these two relatively obviously

260
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,779
that means they're there they're still

261
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,490
out there we all know there's the

262
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:18,009
vulnerabilities don't disappear within

263
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,830
within six months I think that struts

264
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:23,499
one is the one that was really most

265
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,180
damaging in that year so we've seen

266
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:29,069
successful attacks for both of these and

267
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,069
they're still being exploited like I say

268
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:32,649
so there's obviously an exploit DB

269
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:35,019
record those of you don't know exploit

270
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:36,610
dps is great resource for attackers and

271
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:38,409
defenders alike so you can go on there

272
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,909
and you'll see proof of concept code

273
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:41,620
sometimes and so if you're looking for a

274
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,568
known attack and it can be very useful

275
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,040
and you sometimes you get proof of

276
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:46,389
concept code like I say but often you'll

277
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,889
get some kind of payload information

278
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:49,810
like this we're not going to go into the

279
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:51,430
specifics of how this works but we can

280
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:53,219
see that there are certain potential

281
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,609
contact matches within this

282
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,140
so we can see that different parts of we

283
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,090
could use to build a signature or do

284
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,730
since we're hunting on or specifically

285
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:04,170
find this attack one of the interesting

286
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,230
ones in here is the process builder so

287
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,939
this is the way that the Java execution

288
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,350
is run remotely or within the payload

289
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,710
and so you can build up this process

290
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,300
basically and run a command and this is

291
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:19,290
the one that you know it was useful to

292
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,250
us in these examples so now we're

293
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,530
starting to talk about how we're going

294
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,900
to hunt right so this if you start to

295
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,220
build a signature using process builder

296
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,110
there's kind of two outcomes if you've

297
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,250
got low data volumes if you're you know

298
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,200
a relatively small stock with a

299
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,880
relatively small set of systems you know

300
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,590
maybe it only fires four known attacks

301
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,600
it's not really adding value on top of

302
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:39,210
your existing signature set it might not

303
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,650
fire at all it might farm some benign

304
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,120
use maybe you're actually using process

305
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,800
builder internal need to do some stuff

306
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,510
between your applications so you just

307
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,620
turn it off right and sort of waste feel

308
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,420
like you might waste at a better time

309
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,510
don't do something else have a coffee

310
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,430
whatever if you've got high data volumes

311
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:56,250
obviously you can just get swamps right

312
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,660
so you might you might feel the same

313
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,760
that you're not really getting any value

314
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,589
out of it and or you might just sample

315
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,439
bits of data and start see benign use

316
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:07,800
and discard the process again no value

317
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,180
go do something else right you might be

318
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,469
able to use that data later for

319
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,760
forensics and obviously that has used

320
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,740
but again we've got that data storage

321
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,750
problem so this is why automation is

322
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,250
really important so back to this back to

323
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,500
this view of our attackers and whether

324
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,000
or not we've got enough manpower is

325
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:25,740
important right so we want to build that

326
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
automation out so what do we need we

327
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,470
need dedicated resources to be

328
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,900
investigating the data we need then

329
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,370
supported by dedicated tooling this is

330
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,319
something obviously where we can do a

331
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,000
low logic because we build and develop

332
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,010
our own tooling so we can build and

333
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,050
develop tools for our sock and for our

334
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,939
researchers whether that be automation

335
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,949
to go and grab this of malware that

336
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,440
we've seen attempts attack attempts

337
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,610
being used within or whether it's you

338
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,110
know within the stock itself and

339
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,990
searching through data using different

340
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,910
tool sets or to be ready when this

341
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,940
WebLogic thing drops to the world and

342
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:59,730
actually dropped on a Saturday

343
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:04,380
you can see probably not in that little

344
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:05,970
Chinese thing as a Saturday released on

345
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,860
this Chinese blog so that's how we found

346
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,050
it we dropped in and we were able to

347
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,550
find this Chinese blog we were able to

348
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,020
obviously translator and speech people

349
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,819
internally and work out what was going

350
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,530
on it wasn't just on the blog it was on

351
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,510
Twitter as well so how many people are

352
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,640
monitoring Twitter for for new attacks

353
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,620
or emerging threats as we call him but

354
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,020
it wasn't all so bad so but ultimately

355
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,910
it was on the 23rd of December so not

356
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,380
fantastic right but our guys were there

357
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,870
and working and they were trying to work

358
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:33,180
this through and understand what was

359
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,220
going on within the attack and again we

360
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,810
saw this process builder thing right so

361
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,520
we started to realize that this was

362
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,680
obviously a good way of detecting

363
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,630
attacks not just these specific ones but

364
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,180
other attacks that might be happening

365
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,710
[Music]

366
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:49,439
this was months later obviously after

367
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,570
the WebLogic stuff after the struts

368
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,980
stuff so yeah mary coasters we knew that

369
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,690
we knew that process bill that was

370
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:58,620
involved again and we can look again and

371
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:00,030
see what what we could do to use that

372
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,820
for Cynthia hunting right so let's look

373
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,410
at that WebLogic stuff so let's pretend

374
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,460
we didn't know about it we didn't know

375
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,780
about web project we were still

376
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,610
collecting data for hunting purposes

377
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,770
we'd used the struts as to inform us

378
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:13,740
that we needed to look for process

379
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:15,960
builder and we wanted to have a look at

380
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,670
for a generic java signature to detect

381
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,770
attacks against java from the outside

382
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,150
and so we have this payload right so

383
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,250
we'd never seen this async response

384
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,810
service before we knew this process

385
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,300
builder was in there and we'd there was

386
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:29,160
this nasty PowerShell command coming in

387
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,709
through the string within the payload so

388
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:35,100
not fantastic but we knew maybe that we

389
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,360
wanted to look for a process builder so

390
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,090
we really need to pay attention to these

391
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,260
three things and then we start we're on

392
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,760
a threat right we should start to do

393
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,710
some analysis so if we do we're doing a

394
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,030
blind analysis we maybe won't be sure

395
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,530
about what was going on within this

396
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:49,170
payload wouldn't necessarily know the

397
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:51,000
paper process builder was a nice way of

398
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,010
finding an attack what do I do

399
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,930
do I try and run it myself to this does

400
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:57,030
the your eye look anything like we have

401
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,530
internally and it was a 500 response

402
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:01,550
which is kind of important a lot of time

403
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:04,020
people assume is 500s and errors not

404
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,670
success but actually in this case 500

405
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,140
was an indicator of success and so

406
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,740
because we've done this research

407
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:12,069
beforehand we knew that and we knew

408
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,600
that was important and it's that classic

409
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,310
needle in a haystack with needle in a

410
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,010
needle stack as one of my colleagues

411
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:20,229
sometimes calls it right at that point

412
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:22,029
of time right in that at the end of

413
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,860
December in 2017 the amount of traffic

414
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:25,330
was very very low so we wouldn't have

415
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,640
been having high hits from a more tuned

416
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,440
signature but the point is is that you

417
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,360
want to be able to detect to detect

418
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,709
these things early on if you wait until

419
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,810
it's in the public domain if you wait

420
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:36,250
and like we say six months later when

421
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,869
the traffic was out higher and you would

422
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,370
have been seeing much higher hit rate

423
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,930
from that signature and maybe it would

424
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,390
have drawn attention in you're very

425
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:45,399
tuned system you know it's too late

426
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:47,020
basically they've already built out the

427
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,670
attack they've already got over the hub

428
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,050
of things not working or their

429
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:53,229
automation not really being fantastic

430
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:55,899
and systems are being attacked so having

431
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:57,310
that early warning system generated from

432
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:58,720
automation and generating from your

433
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:03,369
threat hunting is really where weak and

434
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,510
we can get valuable for our customers so

435
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,130
the point is you need to optimize for

436
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,050
this new stuff right build automated

437
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:10,480
systems looking for generic exploit code

438
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:13,449
something that you know is used

439
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,640
externally to run commands or part of an

440
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:18,130
RC not that specific you're either the

441
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,540
part of the payload that lets you see

442
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,189
what was happening unless you give an

443
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,810
early warning to your sock and someone

444
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,279
who can go and look at it that security

445
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,660
expertise is where it's really is

446
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:28,060
critical there because they're the ones

447
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,890
that are able to sort of correlate out

448
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,880
and understand what that means and look

449
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:34,209
at the rest of the payload and

450
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,920
understand it and so it's imperative you

451
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:40,109
need a high grade security expertise

452
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,880
within the circle within a third party

453
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:45,510
so more recently we've had done Drupal

454
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,670
which was also quite interesting and

455
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:51,040
very damaging another RCE so Drupal made

456
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,089
an advisory out and we could see ever

457
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,560
obviously that this was going to be

458
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:54,670
significant again and this was in the

459
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,000
core code of Drupal is something I

460
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,589
touched on yesterday not a plug-in

461
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,620
another way of running commands within

462
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:04,899
Drupal which was exploitable extend so

463
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,579
again we've got an exploit DB record the

464
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:09,010
majority of vulnerabilities end up with

465
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:10,239
one at some point but normally this is a

466
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,439
good way of telling whether or not it

467
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,940
can be exploited in all whether

468
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,100
something's going to get better or worse

469
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:18,400
and so meets the same bar is the

470
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:20,560
WebLogic one basically so again because

471
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,649
he start to see some of this going on so

472
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,050
when the call pass the

473
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:26,300
ability was them trying send this get

474
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,519
request the format and we could see a

475
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,529
curl request pulling down file but Sh

476
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:33,050
obviously it wasn't coal-fired FSH we've

477
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,920
changed that there's a difference

478
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,269
between of payload in the actual

479
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,610
vulnerability here in it from the

480
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:39,980
exploit DB record we could write an idea

481
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,509
to catch the vulnerability itself but

482
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,220
the payload was something that wouldn't

483
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:45,439
have been appearing on that expert DB

484
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,939
records so again we can start to look at

485
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:49,579
this data and work out ways of

486
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:52,309
understanding how to catch other similar

487
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:53,479
attacks using Perl or something else and

488
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:55,969
you can get that from looking at the

489
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,769
actual exploitation traffic not just

490
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,749
from you know the vulnerability data

491
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:02,689
that was released by the company or the

492
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:04,429
export DB record so what's the next

493
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:06,319
steps for hunt right so P they're using

494
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:07,869
curl what about W get maybe they're

495
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:10,449
using that you might wanna add rice and

496
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:12,769
data capture mechanisms to look for that

497
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:14,569
Wars out of this type e has the IP

498
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:16,550
address hit and anything else recently

499
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:18,079
obviously what's that payload attempting

500
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,579
to do is it running another payload is

501
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,959
it downloading something is it trying to

502
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:23,540
deploy some kind of crypto a mine or

503
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,699
something else and can you use that to

504
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,439
generate more threat hunting data

505
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:28,819
collection methods and important

506
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:30,559
obviously what does the command control

507
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:31,910
look like can we write detect code for

508
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,449
that and can we find out what that

509
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:42,170
happens the stages after that initial

510
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:43,490
curl attempt so none of these steps

511
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,990
really require attack to have being

512
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,850
successful this could have been an early

513
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,910
warning your threat detection is

514
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:52,879
generating leads for your threat hunting

515
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:54,769
hasn't necessarily detected the success

516
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,329
of the attack but your people are able

517
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:58,490
to then go and look for other attacks

518
00:16:56,329 --> 00:17:00,378
that come along later and that's what's

519
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,059
important is that yeah we can get a

520
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:03,439
signature from a community store we can

521
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:05,329
get a you know how they're from our

522
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,490
vendor their supplies our IDs and we're

523
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:08,779
going to understand necessary the output

524
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,429
to that may be tune it for our own

525
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:11,599
purposes but for hunting is about

526
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:14,270
finding things that we don't know about

527
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,520
all right and finding things that might

528
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:18,199
be suspicious and somebody a human being

529
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,398
can then go and investigate without them

530
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,500
trawling through huge amounts of

531
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:26,089
unstructured data and obviously useful

532
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,770
for it for for for forensics you know if

533
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:29,450
you see that file SH on any of your

534
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,010
boxes or were there any other

535
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,389
vulnerability or any other traffic then

536
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,809
you can start to understand that maybe

537
00:17:32,389 --> 00:17:37,740
that's a system

538
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:40,559
attack this in the lumber so we generate

539
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,409
what we'd call a virtuous circle so you

540
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,789
understand one threat you start to look

541
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:46,710
at that threat whether it's in the URI

542
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:48,299
or somewhere else you strap the payload

543
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,919
you start to dig into the payload you

544
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:52,230
may be trying to execute it somewhere

545
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,669
build an environment there's different

546
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,009
aspects of the attack analyze the

547
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:57,480
command and control camera background

548
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:59,399
have another look at the threat

549
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,539
extractor your eye analyze your eye and

550
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:03,120
you end up with this nice virtuous

551
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:04,139
circle of trying to find attacks that

552
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,789
you don't know about that aren't

553
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:08,369
necessarily in the public domain she's

554
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:10,019
always too late really to analyze the

555
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:12,449
siient that cnc and perhaps release it

556
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:14,879
more content for that and build up a

557
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:17,159
nice virtuous circle basically and

558
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:18,748
within your process and you some people

559
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:20,940
in in more operational roles might call

560
00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:22,590
this continuous improvement and we've

561
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,690
largely automated a lot of this and

562
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:29,369
operationalize that for a hunting

563
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:30,929
capability within your dataset so we end

564
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:33,029
up with our clones fighting clones right

565
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:34,860
so attacker uses some new vulnerability

566
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,330
they might drop the same payload we've

567
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,369
caught it right because the payload was

568
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,720
similar they might use a new payload in

569
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:40,980
the same campaign so it's using a

570
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,659
similar type part of the payload that

571
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,289
process build or something we've caught

572
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:45,600
it again

573
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:48,379
and that's the point you end up with you

574
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,519
know ever sort of increasing amounts of

575
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:52,080
increasing detection capability

576
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:55,169
basically via your throw hunting

577
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,600
mechanism another way of looking at it

578
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:59,129
is this threat tree so you can imagine

579
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,629
that this carries on off the bottom of

580
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:03,149
the slide obviously that you build up

581
00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:04,498
there nice idea of a certain threat and

582
00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:05,939
you can understand the new payload that

583
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:07,980
was in that threat and start to

584
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,330
understand a new threat from that and

585
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,100
they'll get a new pillow down of that

586
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,830
one and carry on and going maybe not

587
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,899
forever but certainly there's very

588
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,549
little new you under the Sun which we

589
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:19,229
should we should realize and attackers

590
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:20,369
in it are inherently lazy most of the

591
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,320
time so they're going to reuse stuff

592
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:24,178
right and that's often what we see and

593
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,559
so you assume each a plateau where

594
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,419
there's very little new to be discovered

595
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:32,490
and you were able to automate that for

596
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:33,809
hunting so summary of what I've talked

597
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,629
about so far can give you advance

598
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:38,279
notices of attacks right and going on

599
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:40,110
that you didn't know about something new

600
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,299
or something weird or a different

601
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,110
approach to an existing exploit that

602
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:45,059
we're out there

603
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:47,189
and obviously really easy to throw these

604
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,780
up in bullet points but that capability

605
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,580
is directly tied to the amount of data

606
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,860
you have right and how you manage that

607
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,049
data most importantly it's all very well

608
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,309
having huge reams of data but the

609
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:57,510
automation you invest in it and the

610
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:59,129
people that drive that automation

611
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:01,200
whether its traditional or machine

612
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,580
learning and ultimately you can't

613
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,870
necessarily be ahead of that tacko but

614
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,159
you can walk right directly in in shadow

615
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,719
so hopefully you're seeing the attacks

616
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,850
when they're attempt it's not successes

617
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,670
and which is really our goal a little

618
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:13,409
logic if you think about you know having

619
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:15,480
four thousand different companies within

620
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:17,520
our common platform and all the data

621
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,610
that comes in and think about the IP

622
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,559
address space of our of our of our

623
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,928
customers it's very long I suppose you

624
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,428
could put it that way and hopefully

625
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:28,320
we're going to see something very early

626
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:30,240
on build detection content and then

627
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,250
discover it for the rest of our the rest

628
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,600
of our customer base before they get to

629
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,820
some vulnerable system that's down here

630
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,110
in a normal organization or with a much

631
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,790
smaller IP address space you have a much

632
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,469
shorter amount of time and thus that's

633
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,730
what I was once a customer via logic and

634
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,340
that's kind of what I bought into right

635
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,350
I had a much better chance of being

636
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,990
protected from attack as I most likely

637
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:53,699
be down here if I perhaps reasonably

638
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:55,830
regularly it's a better summary of kind

639
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,390
of our process really and last fight

640
00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:00,720
there's no there's no sales lies in this

641
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,919
one so we'll take data from a lot of

642
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,570
different sources and that's the point

643
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,250
so it's not just about the network

644
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:07,230
obviously we look at the cloud now

645
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,400
everyone's moving into clouds and most

646
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,559
people have got some kind of cloud

647
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,120
platform so taking the logs that audit

648
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,649
logs the access and change logs from the

649
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,928
cloud is very important as we have

650
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,890
traditionally done on-premise and

651
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:18,870
pulling in data from containers

652
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,280
containers are obviously much more

653
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,139
widespread than they were even a year

654
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,418
ago and so monitoring now is really

655
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,799
important and we built a native

656
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:27,390
container solution that you can take out

657
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,010
the repo and drop into your hosts and it

658
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,929
monitors that into an intro container

659
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:32,850
traffic obviously different connected

660
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:34,410
devices firewalls etc and taking logs

661
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,178
from those and feeding it into our

662
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,860
back-end platform through some of the

663
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:39,600
processes that we've talked about today

664
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,820
to make sure that we can analyze that

665
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,520
data and escalate incidents into our

666
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:46,230
sock so we were we raised a significant

667
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,250
I have incidents through our sock and

668
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,230
talked about some of those numbers

669
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,549
yesterday other than the point is using

670
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,960
that they're different mechanisms

671
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:53,220
whether they're signatures and rules and

672
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,320
traditional methods or whether it's more

673
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,840
modern human or

674
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,070
system anomaly detection or some machine

675
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,230
learning stuff for false positive

676
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,790
reduction we can understand whether

677
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,650
something's medium or low what was

678
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:06,270
informational and ultimately you know

679
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,410
you don't want to be woken up at 3

680
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,120
o'clock in the morning you want an email

681
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,440
or something like that or whether it's

682
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,020
critical and high and needs to be looked

683
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,420
at by a person as quickly as possible

684
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:17,220
see we've got this 15-minute SLA we give

685
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,300
them which is pretty tight to determine

686
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,490
whether or not we should wake our

687
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,950
customers up if it's out of hours and

688
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:25,170
get that to them in a way that describes

689
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,760
their next actions right ultimately our

690
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,770
customers understand their systems the

691
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,550
business and we understand security and

692
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:33,600
those two things that work well together

693
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:35,970
that's me I'm a little bit ahead of time

694
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,250
and we'll see if anyone's got any

695
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:44,130
questions so I can take them on

696
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:46,890
hopefully some use I so two questions if

697
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,870
I may one is how to deal with HTTPS are

698
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,430
you just on the one side of the TLS

699
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,260
offloading and then my second question

700
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:53,550
would be how do you know your customers

701
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,930
network so one of the issues we face

702
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:57,360
having recently merged with another

703
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:58,680
company is we see stuff like WordPress

704
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,209
attacks and then we then have to

705
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,900
question what we've been using WordPress

706
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:03,720
does this matter

707
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:06,300
that sort of thing okay so yeah tell s

708
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,040
or SSL so yeah we're we're the other

709
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,180
side of your float generally speaking it

710
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,560
depends what we've deployed so if we

711
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,930
deployed our wife we can obviously man

712
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,000
and middle that and have their signature

713
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:16,590
certificate on their wife or we're going

714
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,690
to decrypt it on our agent on the house

715
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:20,189
so we have different mechanisms well

716
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,360
we'll have an agent or plug into a

717
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,220
spammer either way we're going to

718
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:27,510
decrypt that we need to we need the

719
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:29,250
certificate it buries customers networks

720
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,660
that's obviously a big challenge it's

721
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,460
easier in the cloud because you've got a

722
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,050
lot of API so you can hook into we're

723
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,940
going to use our scanned data so we

724
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:38,129
deploy our vulnerability scanners and

725
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,600
they'll hopefully run regularly and so

726
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:42,000
we can use that scam data to build an

727
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,679
asset model if you've seen our system

728
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,210
you see we build up a nice topology map

729
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,860
of the environment and we can understand

730
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,480
that but that's where Security's always

731
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:51,629
a partnership right between engineering

732
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,630
and operations and security to make sure

733
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:56,160
that the language you've been used and

734
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:59,490
the way you communicate their lives in

735
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,840
context but that scan data would tell us

736
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:02,400
if the WordPress is in the environment

737
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,780
one of the things I talked about

738
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,310
yesterday was our emerging threat

739
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,780
process and that's where that scan date

740
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,450
is really useful if we see a new

741
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,399
emerging

742
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,380
something hot like that Drupal one was

743
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:13,418
then we can use that scanned data to

744
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,250
proactively reach answer hey we you're

745
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:16,630
vulnerable right you want to pass this

746
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,029
this is going to get bigger and going to

747
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:27,519
get worse so there's a mixture of

748
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:29,300
approaches any more questions no sweet

749
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:33,579
thank you very much thanks

750
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,579
[Applause]
