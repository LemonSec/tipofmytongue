00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:09,180
Cheers hi everyone i'm seth the savvy

2
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:12,360
and quick run-through of who we are and

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:16,039
all the busy stuff at the top when I'm

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,930
not doing typical stuff family DIY

5
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:22,800
inventing my own board game and watching

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,000
rugby any chance I get a B hi I'm avi so

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,070
I'm a recent graduate from this

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,170
University doing forensics computer and

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,360
cybersecurity my current role at the

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,000
moment is a cyber threat hunter and this

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,469
is my first job since coming out of uni

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,820
so between finishing Yulia and starting

13
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,590
my job I managed to travel around

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,750
Southeast Asia to make the most of my

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,920
time off so you're welcome to catch me

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,200
later if you wanted any more information

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:48,750
about me it's time for me as well ok so

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:52,890
start off how many people here know

19
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,269
about the attack matrix and mitre one or

20
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,350
two excellent because I didn't want to

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,390
go into too much of it

22
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,660
I'm really high level might is a

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:05,339
not-for-profit organization the first to

24
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:07,920
have the dog TLD they invent it's the

25
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,600
CVE database for vulnerability and patch

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,909
management and all of that that became a

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,100
common language for the vulnerability

28
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,859
managers and IT teams out there to

29
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,689
understand which vulnerabilities they

30
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:21,240
had to look like what they've done is

31
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,520
exactly the same but for TTP so tools

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:28,139
techniques and processes of the attack

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,990
routes why did I choose attack to set up

34
00:01:28,139 --> 00:01:31,770
a dedicated fret hunting service I

35
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,869
didn't want to reinvent the wheel

36
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,619
there's two hundred-plus techniques

37
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,270
created by a load of really good

38
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:40,859
analysts out there who all of the

39
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,810
information is based on publicly

40
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:46,318
available information all the references

41
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:51,270
are on the tack framework um so ya don't

42
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:54,270
want to reinvent the wheel and ya create

43
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,848
loads and loads of 278 or whatever

44
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,759
John's created they're already there use

45
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:03,749
them and it's also about having that

46
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,459
common language so as a technician I

47
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:08,639
might have be looking at hunting on a

48
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:12,510
technique I might be a checkpoint a

49
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:15,690
Cisco technician and understand how to

50
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,370
look for that in Cisco and SharePoint so

51
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,760
somebody else within the team might be

52
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,170
the juniper or Palo Alto they can

53
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,640
interpret the technique and then

54
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,739
translate it to the language of their

55
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,140
tools and technologies obviously

56
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,440
different languages as well is English

57
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,359
Chinese German and it's also there to

58
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,210
help me identify the gaps in our

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,270
defenses so if we're looking at as many

60
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:41,520
of the techniques as possible each of

61
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,470
those techniques relies on a data source

62
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,260
those data source are fed by your

63
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,990
security controls your a/v your EDR your

64
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,359
endpoint detect and response tools your

65
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:55,100
proxies all of those feed into the data

66
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,000
sources and those give you the detection

67
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,370
capabilities against each of the

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,830
techniques if you find you haven't got a

69
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,720
data source you've got a gap in your

70
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,480
detection capabilities and possibly your

71
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,310
prevention technologies as well so you

72
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,359
need to pass that on to your security

73
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,400
engineering and your security

74
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,080
architecture teams they can take those

75
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,240
gaps raise them to the business give

76
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,820
them the what the risk is to the

77
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,970
business of having that gap in your

78
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:24,030
defenses and hopefully either close it

79
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,190
down or accept the risk so that's why I

80
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,890
chose March or a tap framework to set up

81
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,540
the dedicated service and just quickly

82
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,820
the fret hunting services they're at

83
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,220
John's already mentioned in his talk

84
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,560
earlier it's that continuous improvement

85
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,390
cycle it's not just standing still it's

86
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,100
ensuring your business is moving forward

87
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,670
all the time and looking for new stuff

88
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,980
and we have a dedicated sock they do the

89
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,049
known stuff and the known unknown we

90
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,140
look for the unknown it is unknown only

91
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:54,780
to our business it's not unknown

92
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:59,630
necessarily across the internet so

93
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,630
that's why and where do you start

94
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:06,989
so my to attack framework has two

95
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,600
hundred-plus techniques in it I naively

96
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:12,330
thought and we actually recruited the

97
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,239
team most and started in July I thought

98
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,980
between July and Christmas I came two

99
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,130
hundred-plus techniques we get all of

100
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,690
them done neither not two so there are a

101
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,840
number of techniques in there that

102
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,969
require things like physical forensics

103
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,580
etc if you're looking at firmware and

104
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,229
bios and stuff like that

105
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,938
you can't automate that you can't grab

106
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:33,020
the log logs back automatically you

107
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,550
actually have to sit down and do

108
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,080
forensic there are a number of

109
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,810
techniques in there that you just can't

110
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:44,210
do in an automated fashion in a fast

111
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:46,280
fashion so it wasn't achievable then

112
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,438
obviously gaining access so this age-old

113
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,229
problem for IT and security it's getting

114
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:53,599
access to the tools and the data to

115
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:57,878
actually look for the detections look to

116
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:57,878
create actions look for activity and

117
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:05,090
sorry we still have that problem we were

118
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:07,729
global we're a global business so

119
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:10,400
getting access to the data over in one

120
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:12,650
of the international markets that can be

121
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,599
a challenge as well if we're lucky in UK

122
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,219
we can get however the data pretty

123
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:19,099
quickly but if we have to send off it

124
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:21,199
could take half a day a day a week or

125
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:22,909
even a month to get that data back so we

126
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,440
write the detection we contact the

127
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:26,090
market you given the information and

128
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,180
eventually we get the infant there the

129
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,310
data back so we can do some analysis

130
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:35,120
then eventually we get access to the

131
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:37,129
tools more data and we've got a small

132
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,889
bit of malicious activity in a whole

133
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:41,629
load of normal activity the needle in

134
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:43,400
the haystack or needle in the needle as

135
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:48,469
was said earlier a needle in a needle

136
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:50,989
step and it's trying to find that one

137
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:52,819
piece of malicious activity amongst all

138
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,669
of the other suspicious activity that

139
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:58,190
your developers your IT admins your

140
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:59,830
other security people all of it all that

141
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,389
all of them are doing things like

142
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,659
PowerShell commands and stuff like that

143
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:07,430
if they're sending PowerShell up to

144
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:10,520
Amazon things like that they're going to

145
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,990
be using base64 to encode it and that's

146
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:16,400
gonna flag on one of our optimization

147
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:19,250
techniques so yeah eventually you get

148
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,138
there there are other hurdles but I'm

149
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,440
trying to stick to free free things from

150
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:23,440
slow

151
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,520
so what tolling do we need so the most

152
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,350
important thing is record everything

153
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,680
record what you do in your incident

154
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:42,820
tracker this has two benefits one of

155
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,949
them is helping the juniors within the

156
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,680
team or helping other analysts in the

157
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:48,850
team if you've record it once somebody

158
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,979
else can use what you've already done

159
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,570
and build on that so they're not doing

160
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:54,570
the same thing again not duplicating

161
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:57,639
effort you're only doing it once

162
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,210
secondly top tip and I'll come back to

163
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,270
this later

164
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:03,909
is records anytime you have a true

165
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,560
positive and actual cyber incidence of

166
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:08,380
malicious activity within your

167
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,229
environment try and track the technique

168
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:14,469
number in noir instant tracker against

169
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:16,389
that security incident that's on this

170
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:20,169
later but it helps you prioritize it

171
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:25,360
helps you start an attack is very much

172
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:27,969
an endpoint centric so it's all about

173
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,419
the endpoint so having a good ADR tool

174
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:33,940
this one was mention earlier if you get

175
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:37,479
chance search for Microsoft blog for

176
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:40,419
weapons there's a really good using

177
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:42,340
power bi and sis mom to do fret hunting

178
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,830
there's free stuff out there obviously

179
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,979
there's all of the commercial stuff you

180
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:50,500
come Blackfyre ihx tiny and cisco amp

181
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:53,919
and plenty of others out there that you

182
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,260
can use as well but most of the

183
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,150
techniques are based around activity on

184
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:01,060
your endpoints your workstations your

185
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:03,460
laptops your servers so having a good

186
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,460
EDR tool is key for threat hunting in my

187
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,739
opinion

188
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:11,138
lastly threat hunt threat hunting scene

189
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,990
so we've actually set up a separate

190
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:16,240
scene for fret hunting we our security

191
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,039
operations center have a court that the

192
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,560
enterprise scene feeding them in alerts

193
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,960
and but that's been tuned for that for

194
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,729
the known known and the known unknowns

195
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,219
so that's the stuff that we know about

196
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:28,570
we know how to deal with we don't want

197
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,849
to be giving them all of the false

198
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,588
positive all of suspicious but not

199
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:34,828
necessarily bad activity because

200
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:38,079
otherwise they'd be wasting their cycles

201
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:39,789
not actually fixing bad stuff they'd be

202
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:41,620
there trying to tune stuff out that's

203
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,449
our job as for hunting is to chew

204
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,550
down to a state that they can just get

205
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,800
straight into the incident and follow

206
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,959
the playbook and I said we've done it

207
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,910
separately you can do it within your

208
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,040
existing scene if you're able to

209
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:57,189
segregate it out or just keep the data

210
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:06,610
to the side but for us it was easier to

211
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:10,000
set it up on a separate system sorry

212
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:11,650
so I mentioned prioritization earlier

213
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,130
where do we start how do I fix that

214
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:17,680
problem and so it's not right technique

215
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,630
prevalence what I said about recording

216
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,620
the technique number or numbers within

217
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:26,290
the incident tracker that then gives me

218
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,540
a prevalence of which techniques have

219
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:31,319
been used against my environment now if

220
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:34,630
I haven't got automatic automated

221
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,570
response to those techniques I need to

222
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:39,550
develop those automated responses to

223
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,279
them so I'm going to prioritize any

224
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:45,099
techniques I'm actually seeing used

225
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:46,600
against us the more they use the more

226
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,790
likely unfried that the higher our

227
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,620
prioritize them and then I'm going to

228
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,480
deprioritize those techniques I've

229
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,279
already looked at in the last 30 days

230
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,930
because I don't want to be looking at

231
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:58,870
the same techniques again and again and

232
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:01,510
again unless I prioritize them in other

233
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:05,339
words obviously so we've got a scoring

234
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:09,810
mechanism to try and narrow it down and

235
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:13,360
on the left there data sources so

236
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:14,890
mention it already you need to do the

237
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,360
mapping against your data sources

238
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,240
against your security tools to

239
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,490
understand which ones you've got and

240
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,320
where your gaps are now obviously you

241
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,060
want to prioritize the ones that answer

242
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,580
to the most techniques process

243
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,770
monitoring is 149 of the techniques if

244
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,260
you've got process monitoring probably

245
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:34,720
through a new dr tool you you will be

246
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:38,050
able to detect some of the activity of

247
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,820
those techniques but obviously there are

248
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:42,069
others in there from my previous

249
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,630
experience you've got PowerShell that

250
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,400
only answers one technique you know

251
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,260
cover that a bit more in a bit and

252
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,230
you've got email

253
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,360
you've got properties and DNS records or

254
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,459
they only own your although they only

255
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,440
answer one technique they only give you

256
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:56,878
the detection

257
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,509
bilities and against one or two

258
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:02,190
techniques my experience is that I can

259
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:04,379
get a lot of information out those log

260
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,529
sources out of those data sources so I

261
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:10,290
would prioritize those above and finally

262
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:12,480
threat intelligence so threat

263
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:16,529
intelligence will pass this various

264
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:20,519
groups that might be likely to attack us

265
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:21,930
or attack the industry so will collate

266
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,579
those groups we'll look at the

267
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,949
techniques that those groups have known

268
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:28,469
to have used any technique that's been

269
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:30,660
used by multiple groups will get a

270
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,610
higher priority than those techniques

271
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,009
that are used by only one or two groups

272
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:38,189
because again I want to get as much bang

273
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:39,660
for my buck as possible I want to get as

274
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:41,670
many techniques that are applicable to

275
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,439
my business investigated because I'm

276
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,509
more likely to catch the bad guys and

277
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:48,480
girls when they attack us if they're if

278
00:11:45,509 --> 00:12:02,490
they're aimed us so threat Intel is

279
00:11:48,480 --> 00:12:04,259
really useful nope sorry and and that's

280
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,029
that's those are the cool ways there are

281
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:09,569
some other prioritizations that we do as

282
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:12,899
well but that then gives us a top-20

283
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:15,689
that we really focus down on within the

284
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:18,990
business and we look at all of the

285
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:20,639
techniques but those top 20 are the ones

286
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,759
that are most applicable to us and were

287
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:29,540
really important moving on I'll quickly

288
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:29,540
run through a process not that quickly

289
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:37,519
sorry to spit up right well I'll start

290
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,479
the fire we've prioritized our technique

291
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,189
we've taken our technique from the

292
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,439
attack framework we've got all the

293
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:45,839
information out of attack and how it's

294
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:47,819
used by the different groups and we'll

295
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,399
create detection for it and we might

296
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:51,990
start with a very wide detection for

297
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,759
that technique and we might then start

298
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,649
narrowing it down based on the threat

299
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,470
Intel we've had and based on the data we

300
00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:00,480
have available etc once we've written a

301
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:03,269
detection we then go and collect the

302
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,250
data as I said that could be pretty much

303
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:07,110
instantly if we've got it available in

304
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,450
an answer where I assume in the UK

305
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,160
market but as it's

306
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,950
it could take a lot longer if it's an

307
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,930
international market so we get hold of

308
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,660
the data eventually we feed all of that

309
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:21,900
information into our threat hunting

310
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:25,110
scene and we perform analysis then we

311
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:27,209
start the analysis tuning model and we

312
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,460
go around that circle quite a few times

313
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:32,630
to try and get rid of as many false

314
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:36,090
positives as possible to get rid of the

315
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:38,310
developers sending encoded commands to

316
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,680
AWS because we know that team we know

317
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,660
that they do that on a daily basis we

318
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,000
should have other techniques and

319
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,770
detections in place if they're cop if

320
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,970
their accounts compromised what I'm

321
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,949
trying to do is just find this

322
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:52,320
particular technique so I want to narrow

323
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:56,280
it down so that I get just a true

324
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,230
positive alerting out of it once we've

325
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,920
done that tuning cycle we tuck it into

326
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:03,900
our dashboards on our scene and we

327
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,120
monitor it for a while we then will pass

328
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,920
off to the red team and get them to run

329
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,170
a test against it and hopefully that

330
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,449
should flag in our dashboard and we

331
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,370
should see that it's actually working if

332
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:16,650
it doesn't then we go back into the

333
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:19,890
tuning cycle and try and fix where we

334
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:20,459
broke it and if we do find something too

335
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,430
positive

336
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:25,260
we've passed it on to our Intel team and

337
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,579
they can share it with trusted partners

338
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:30,810
but they can also then give us

339
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:33,510
additional information so I think it was

340
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:35,939
Dan was talking about the TAC team it's

341
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,830
if we find it in one point in the TAC

342
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,010
chain and we can find the most likely

343
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:43,140
other techniques that those groups would

344
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,670
use or that multiple groups are used we

345
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,319
can go and try and look for activity

346
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:48,719
there we could try and find out how did

347
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,220
they get into the environment and what

348
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,980
what they were trying to get and what

349
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,870
they're trying to get after when we've

350
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,430
done all of the tuning we can we've got

351
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:59,670
it to a really good stage they're only

352
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:01,560
fires on a true positive we pass it over

353
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:04,040
to the shop we write the playbook so

354
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:09,449
they can eradicate containing the cover

355
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:18,660
bit hot on the back there and so that's

356
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:21,450
the process so I mentioned the cyber

357
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:25,110
attack chain kill chain Lockheed Martin

358
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:26,880
all that this is actually the 12 tactics

359
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:29,550
so these are column headers in the

360
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:33,000
framework here they loosely translate to

361
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:36,300
the the cyber kill chain down at this

362
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,680
end down here you've got exfiltration

363
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:42,630
and impact are the two tactics in the

364
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,040
framework those are the ones that

365
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,950
actually have an impact of the business

366
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,079
and there is some impact further up the

367
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:52,470
chain but it's more resource utilization

368
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:55,920
than actual cost of the business when

369
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:58,380
the bad guys and girls still copy your

370
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,990
data they're stealing your IP when

371
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,900
they're deleting or encrypting your data

372
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:06,090
they're impacting your productivity when

373
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,250
they're changing your data changing our

374
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,650
customers account to their accounts and

375
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,570
we have pay them instead of our customer

376
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:16,350
they're costing us money and reputation

377
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:18,630
or damage so we want to stop them we

378
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,550
want to stop much further up to the kill

379
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:22,830
chain so we want to detect them much

380
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:25,140
further up the kill chain so our job in

381
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:27,780
threat hunting is to keep pushing

382
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,730
pushing the attackers further up the

383
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,860
kill chain it's not just fret hunting

384
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:34,710
the whole the cyber operations needs to

385
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:37,740
keep pushing them up so that that's our

386
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:42,980
main goal and as I said I've built the

387
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:47,130
team in start the team in January 2018

388
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:49,140
actually recruited by July I've got

389
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:53,340
three juniors and free seniors including

390
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:54,960
myself now what the attack framework has

391
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:57,660
is as I said all of that common

392
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,100
knowledge built by senior analysts

393
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,890
really good analysts who know their

394
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,840
stuff by using the framework I'm able to

395
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,579
that the juniors are able to not just

396
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,960
rely on the seniors in a team to get to

397
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,520
share their experience but they're able

398
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,650
to use all of the information on the

399
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,780
attack matrix so it's a force multiplier

400
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,190
it allows you to have more senior

401
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,710
analysts in your team than you actually

402
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:19,890
have

403
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:22,140
and tunnel vision so I might be really

404
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:24,000
good at finding PowerShell I might stop

405
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,040
the attackers every time they use

406
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,890
passion against me no matter what

407
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,810
PowerShell commands or how they've tried

408
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,970
to hide I always find them when they're

409
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,950
using PowerShell and I'm really good at

410
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,690
that I really enjoy looking at looking

411
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,450
when they're using PowerShell they'll

412
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:42,270
work out that they can't get past me if

413
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:44,730
they use any partial commands now if I

414
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,410
just sit there and focus on it they will

415
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,920
pivot past me they will use another

416
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:52,610
tactic another technique to escalate

417
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:55,650
their privileges to move laterally and

418
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:57,990
if I just look at partial all the time I

419
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:00,030
will miss them so by using the framework

420
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,280
by looking at what other techniques they

421
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:04,950
could be using against you you stop

422
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,170
tunnel vision so this is why I believe

423
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:11,790
we have it gives benefit to use the

424
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:17,730
attack framework and on that note I will

425
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:19,350
hand over to other thank you so the

426
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,880
following slides an example of how I

427
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,439
have performed a threat hunt and

428
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,660
investigation using the might attack

429
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,340
framework and I must add that the tools

430
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,230
technologies and groups used throughout

431
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,699
this run-through I made up do to protect

432
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:33,270
to protect the identities of the

433
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:35,190
innocent so it starts off by our threat

434
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:37,080
entire team feeding me information with

435
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,240
potential groups that could potentially

436
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,770
harm our company so the might of type

437
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,660
framework features multiple attack

438
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:47,910
groups however for this example I've

439
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:49,170
used asmath group and Gorgon group so

440
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,940
when looking at the two groups that

441
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,650
threaten time provided in my to attack

442
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,970
it is seen that each group includes a

443
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,820
list of techniques that they have

444
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,470
potentially used to harm companies so my

445
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,030
job as a threat hunter is to create

446
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,190
detections for each of these techniques

447
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:04,980
so that we have the ability to find and

448
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,720
contain against them so for this example

449
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,030
I try to look at any common technique

450
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,170
situated across break groups and it

451
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:13,020
turns out there are ten common

452
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:14,790
techniques so the next stage is

453
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,590
prioritization so cephus already

454
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,500
mentioned prioritizing techniques

455
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:21,629
so once narrowing down the top 20 common

456
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,760
techniques I notice I personally hadn't

457
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,200
visited security disabled and security

458
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,810
tools in the last 30 days

459
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,100
and in addition I did speak to a few

460
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,510
members of the team and I found out

461
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,330
there was in a global detection

462
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:35,010
currently in place so they're moving on

463
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:39,030
to pick him what attack group to focus

464
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:40,950
on so as you can see both groups have

465
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:43,080
used the technique differently Gorgon

466
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,250
group use task kill command to disable

467
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,020
security tools

468
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,760
whereas Lazarus group disable them

469
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,770
through using SSH so I decide

470
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,390
to focus on Gorgon group as I thought I

471
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,470
could probably create the detection and

472
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,420
I look quite easy

473
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,160
and in addition I don't have a look

474
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,930
around and we did already have detection

475
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,470
in place for all azimuth group as we

476
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:06,190
monitor an SSH so then moving on to the

477
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:07,600
data sources so when you click into the

478
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,760
technique I'm able to see what data

479
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,590
sources the technique requires and as a

480
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,510
team we've been able to map out each

481
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,230
data source to our existing tools and

482
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:18,610
this is being great as a new starter as

483
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,200
still getting to know the environment so

484
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,409
it has sped up my hunting process

485
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,610
because I Nabal a tool tool account so

486
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,830
for this technique I knew that we had

487
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,449
command line monitoring in place which

488
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,330
will enable me to patch to the use of

489
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:33,130
tasks he'll be in use however it isn't

490
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,350
as always easy as it sounds

491
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:37,690
as I am part of a global team is

492
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:40,120
sometimes difficult to retrieve data due

493
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,160
to access issues and these problems I'm

494
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,110
still having today

495
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,970
so therefore sometimes have to contact

496
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:48,189
international markets or security

497
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:51,190
engineers to help me gain access to this

498
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,410
certain data I mean it can be very long

499
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:55,480
process but again it's been great before

500
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:57,250
a new starter as I'm able to get to

501
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,640
these people in different teams and even

502
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:03,670
in different countries so then moving on

503
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,860
to creating the detection as you can see

504
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,090
I created a PowerShell script that

505
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,370
allows me to collect my online

506
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:11,830
information from one endpoint detection

507
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:14,169
and response tool I can't lie I did

508
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:16,300
start with an old script embedded by one

509
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,890
of our seniors in our team but I managed

510
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:21,159
to adapt it to alert for this particular

511
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:22,960
technique so this this script will alert

512
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,400
me when task Hill has been used to say

513
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,750
about any of our security tools in our

514
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,700
environment and then I also wrote this

515
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:33,580
this detection in another detection and

516
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,320
response tool so as you can see in this

517
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,810
in this tool I use the query in the

518
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,980
console to create alerts so you may

519
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:41,470
wonder why I've created two different

520
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,730
detection and two different tools so

521
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,580
this is just to guarantee a wider

522
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:49,060
coverage across different markets so

523
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:50,350
then where does all the days ago all the

524
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,270
things to capture fees and so our

525
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,669
hunting scene where we can tune out any

526
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,870
false positives so when I first break

527
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:58,570
the detection there was a lot of noise

528
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:00,520
which you can see and as a team we are

529
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,860
constantly moving tech needs in and out

530
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,110
of the dashboard as

531
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,580
prioritization changes so the lower

532
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,290
priority hadn't sit in secondary

533
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,939
dashboards where we still monitor them

534
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:11,280
individually but just not as regularly

535
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,740
as I stopped when - I mean it should

536
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,160
also be noted that these are just top

537
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,720
top 20 random techniques I've picked but

538
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,470
even our own top 20 techniques can be

539
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,080
very noisy at times so then moving on to

540
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:27,420
tune in the detection I was able to

541
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,100
determine that the 1500 alerts were all

542
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:32,610
down to three privileged accounts used

543
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,740
by our team our IT team so they have the

544
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:36,719
responsibility of deploying I got the

545
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,340
update and security tours and as it

546
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,070
turns out security tools can be in a

547
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:44,520
pain so I'll install therefore they use

548
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:46,350
tasks of a lot however before it's glued

549
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,540
in the three privileged accounts from my

550
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:50,100
hunt I checked in these counts that were

551
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:52,710
monitored and controlled through other

552
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,570
created detection that we have in place

553
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:56,280
so if their account ever did become

554
00:22:54,570 --> 00:23:01,049
compromised we would know about it

555
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:03,090
elsewhere so then once this detection is

556
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:04,830
tuned and the alerting is in place I

557
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,439
will pass the entire red team who were

558
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:09,270
kindly test if the detection works so in

559
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,220
this case we just get our red team to

560
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:13,950
read a skill on their machine and killed

561
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,960
off one of our security tools and then

562
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,490
if the detection does work and then

563
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,160
would appear on the dashboard which you

564
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:22,410
can see there and this is a very helpful

565
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,120
process as we can actually know whether

566
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,950
our detection works or whether we use go

567
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:30,418
back and tune it again so it comes back

568
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:32,400
with the right information so then

569
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:34,470
surface or dimension it is important to

570
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,780
record all of this into in an instant

571
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,850
tracker even if it is a false positive

572
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,620
so other members of the team know what

573
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:43,020
I've been up to and then they can maybe

574
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,449
use the existing tools or detection to

575
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,220
develop it further so within the

576
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,840
security ticket I would start by

577
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,090
referencing the merit attack technique

578
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,360
I've been working on and then along with

579
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:55,889
the technique number our next step would

580
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,709
be to write the potential potential

581
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:00,510
impacts with our company mention war

582
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:02,460
detection is currently in place and then

583
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,679
any mitigate mitigation steps that we

584
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:09,059
may need to take if our company was ever

585
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:10,740
to be affected by this technique so when

586
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,030
I'm when the detection gets to a stage

587
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,309
where it is only firing through

588
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,350
positives I would create a playbook for

589
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:17,000
our soul

590
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:19,730
alerts again they will know how to

591
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,120
contain eradicate and recover against

592
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:24,770
this technique so then to summarize my

593
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,959
experience using the motor type

594
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:29,030
framework I think it's been a great

595
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,340
experience that it has sped up my hunted

596
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,740
it allowed me to plan out what I should

597
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,510
be hunting for and by us mapping data

598
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:38,600
sources to our tools I know we're so

599
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:40,760
heading to as I am relatively new to

600
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,549
this cyber security industry it has

601
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,710
increased my knowledge and skills in

602
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:47,480
common attack types and it showed me how

603
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,510
I can detect and prevent against certain

604
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,220
techniques whilst I could stand here and

605
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:54,110
this many benefits about using my to

606
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,760
attack I think it's important for you to

607
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:58,219
know like how long it's taken me to get

608
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,770
here and so our team did form about a

609
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,750
year ago and to gain an understanding of

610
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:04,460
how each different detection works and

611
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:07,190
how to detect them has probably taken me

612
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,080
at least four to six months I think it's

613
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:11,299
important to try find the baseline data

614
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,879
of your company so that understanding

615
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:15,530
any false positives and then adapting

616
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,780
each technique to make sure that we have

617
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:19,460
the best detection monitoring and

618
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:22,549
response available to these potential

619
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,590
attacks thank you all for listening to

620
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:24,980
my run through and now pass you back to

621
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:31,280
sir

622
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:35,530
you are mentioned a few final tips okay

623
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:38,149
so three is the magic number still and

624
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:39,980
I've already said it had the technique

625
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,190
number two your incident tickets it

626
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,090
helps you prioritize it helps you

627
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:46,820
understand which ones you need to look

628
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:49,580
at more automate and get into a known

629
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:52,460
name true positive for the stock to be

630
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:56,600
able to respond to it and prioritize the

631
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:59,929
twenty techniques so as Katie Nichols

632
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,209
from mitre and Brian Mayer I think it is

633
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:05,179
from red Canary did a talk back in

634
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:07,850
January where they did the top twenty

635
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:10,820
mitre techniques they're seeing used in

636
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:12,889
mitre and in red Canary they were

637
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,799
different because they've got different

638
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:18,289
customers or a different infrastructure

639
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:20,179
and now different organizations and

640
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:22,700
there are a few similarities but they

641
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:26,450
weren't necessarily in at the same level

642
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:28,730
within that those top twenty and so I

643
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:31,880
just took that as a starter for ten well

644
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:34,429
Dhafir 20 even and focused in almost 20

645
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,860
it will really help you do not try and

646
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:40,070
eat the whole whale in one go do not do

647
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:43,070
hall 217 do not try and do it we failed

648
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:45,168
you will for help narrow down to the top

649
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:48,379
20 and then keep those 20 up today as

650
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:50,840
the business changes and the attacks

651
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:54,710
change reprioritize which techniques

652
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,959
you're going to focus on wall or to make

653
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:59,270
detection of the techniques I get bored

654
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,160
very easily I don't want to do the same

655
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:02,799
thing again and again again I want to

656
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,330
look at new stuff all the time

657
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,070
automate it get it into the stock if you

658
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:10,100
can automate the protection prevention

659
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:12,649
remediation automate it just get it out

660
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:15,350
of your hair don't don't redo stuff all

661
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:18,679
the time and those are kind of my three

662
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:20,030
tips for the thing anything else as Abe

663
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,190
you said come and find us

664
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:25,190
after the talk and we'll go through more

665
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:27,669
you want any information it's free go

666
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:30,790
and have a look at at ikomaya dot org

667
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:39,269
thank you very much

668
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:50,230
[Applause]

669
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:51,970
does anyone have any questions yes he

670
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:54,669
said you've got like a red team that you

671
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:58,090
pass stuff off to their internal how

672
00:27:54,669 --> 00:28:01,179
much are you worried about if they just

673
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:02,529
test your existing hypothesis that do

674
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,809
you ever bring in like external red

675
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:07,600
teamers to just without giving them any

676
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:09,279
information about what you've done you

677
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,049
do an attack part and see if we detect

678
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,169
it or do you rely just on your internal

679
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:19,690
team yes so that yeah we use internal

680
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:25,740
and external red tubes we also have some

681
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:25,740
automated testing as well so yes we do

682
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:38,049
global you read it no I'm just just

683
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,730
really quickly do you ever like looking

684
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:42,360
to detail of the unknown unknown so

685
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:44,499
these sort of abnormal ease around

686
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,869
things are just just a bit odd a bit

687
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:49,389
weird something is not wrong and how do

688
00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:52,990
you if you do can you actually apply

689
00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:54,998
that to to Montee absolutely so mitre

690
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:57,730
isn't every technique that can be used

691
00:28:54,999 --> 00:29:00,999
that the point is is if we're looking at

692
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:02,649
as wide a range of possible of the mitre

693
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:06,279
techniques these are the most common

694
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:08,139
techniques the apt groups out there a

695
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:11,350
lot of them almost all of them have been

696
00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:12,969
mapped into those techniques they might

697
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,769
use zero days they might use new

698
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:18,129
techniques that not being documented

699
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:19,990
anywhere before but at some point they

700
00:29:18,129 --> 00:29:21,998
will have to do they'll have to film

701
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:23,590
that tactic and the chances are they

702
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:26,379
might use a zero day to get into your

703
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,970
business but then they'll live off the

704
00:29:26,379 --> 00:29:29,860
land so we'll be looking at their

705
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:32,320
activity that could be administrator old

706
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:34,449
could be malicious we're always trying

707
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,830
to find it you might not find them at

708
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:37,210
the first stage and we might not find

709
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:39,850
them in the middle but we should find

710
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:41,889
something in there if we keep looking at

711
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:43,748
the whole as much of the attack

712
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:50,070
framework as much as many of the

713
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:54,830
techniques as possible anymore

714
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:58,070
No thank you very much chisel

715
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:58,070
[Applause]
