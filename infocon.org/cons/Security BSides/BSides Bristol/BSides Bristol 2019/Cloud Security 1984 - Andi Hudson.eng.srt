1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,179
further - first things first just give a

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:18,180
round of applause for all the wonderful

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:19,619
people here it's great it is here and

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,810
it's great to see so many people that

5
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:25,050
they're in the in the InfoSec community

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,220
so so everybody loves a disclaimer so

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,800
let's get that out the way

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,610
there's the framer so let's crack on

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,760
right so a little bit about me I'm Andy

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:38,219
I'm Andy I joined IBM three years ago

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,800
security architect by now lead a growing

12
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:45,989
team of security architects within the

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:48,780
business and we've grown from 1 to 24 in

14
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:52,379
the last 12 months so if you're looking

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,989
for any jobs look up IBM jobs that so

16
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,809
cool so a brief agenda right this isn't

17
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,998
going to be in any particular order so

18
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:02,550
when it's all about the Clyde we're

19
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:05,640
going to talk about the problem you know

20
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,350
hackers things like that we're gonna

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,810
talk about the solution and then if

22
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,720
there's any time for a conclusion and

23
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:16,290
some questions at the end so quick show

24
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:20,759
of hands who's read the classic novel

25
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:22,830
1984 by George Orwell yeah cool right so

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,470
that's it for those that haven't it's a

27
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,920
dystopian novel written in 1948 Penina

28
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,230
when computers looked much like this so

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,110
you know make further kind of you know

30
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:36,650
procrastinating about what happened then

31
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:39,360
what is the Clyde where did it come from

32
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:42,480
either there how did it get there what

33
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,840
when was it invented so in the very

34
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,930
beginning you have these heavy people

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,690
does anybody know who they are so we

36
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,670
have grain valve for the left of Herman

37
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:58,740
Hollerith to the right so I mean

38
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:01,320
probably better known for telephones was

39
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,869
Graham Bell although history really kind

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,639
of attributes it to this guy here he

41
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,230
invented the very first communications

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,390
device but it was Graham Bell actually

43
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:12,810
made it easier to do and Herman

44
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,769
Hollerith

45
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:18,340
invented the punch card

46
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:21,460
later machine which which then it went

47
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,680
on to make IBM and of course there were

48
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,430
hackers as well so so did he know who

49
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,160
this guy is

50
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,890
Shirin thank you so I'm actually enigma

51
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,840
so of course you know when we had

52
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,160
computers back in the past we were

53
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,970
already hacking so this was this was

54
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:40,150
when we were down at Bletchley Park

55
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:42,970
hacking the Enigma machine which which

56
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,820
enabled us to decipher the messages from

57
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,410
the Nazis in the Second World War so in

58
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:51,040
the not so beginning obviously

59
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:53,530
telephones were more kind of you know

60
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,400
made accessible to everybody and so we

61
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,640
had phone phreaks

62
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,970
and we also had old IBM mainframes as

63
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,369
well so of course you know history shows

64
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,320
us that it's always been there it's

65
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:10,230
always been a problem it's anybody know

66
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:14,230
what this is so 2600 books was very good

67
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:17,619
cigar lounge and there so it has PC

68
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,970
nowadays so yeah basically for those

69
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,460
that don't know what it is there was a

70
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,890
serial in America called Captain Crunch

71
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,940
and it used to play 2600 Hertz times

72
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,200
telephone lines so if people who have

73
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,180
found the telephone line it would open

74
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,290
up free calls you get free calls and

75
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:34,900
some course phone free King was born so

76
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:36,850
it escapes me Lobby I think it was John

77
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,560
Draper something like that who was

78
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,320
nicknamed the Captain Crunch who did a

79
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,290
short well quite a long stint in jail

80
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,690
but further subsequent to that people

81
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,250
are also intrigued by this 2600 so

82
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,950
people started to emulate it when

83
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,030
obviously the the telecoms companies and

84
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,780
the government's made Captain Crunch

85
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:57,670
stops selling this so so some of the

86
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,460
people that used to replicate this this

87
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:03,459
device it was called a blue box Steve

88
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:05,050
Wozniak Steve Jobs so you know there's

89
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,240
hackers everywhere people have been

90
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:11,190
hacking forever and ever and ever and so

91
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:15,359
cause hacking continued to evolve so

92
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:18,089
when I will add yes that is me

93
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:22,450
computers look much more like this and

94
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:26,409
and III as opposed to kind of behind

95
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:28,270
people use computers nowadays I use them

96
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,669
probably in a lot of ways that

97
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:32,979
that you that you use them and so of

98
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:35,740
course you know and I was about 11 I

99
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:38,169
started to build my own computers and so

100
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,330
going on but it's in board systems and

101
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:42,789
things like that you know that the the

102
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,340
the internet came along and it was

103
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:47,169
amazing because it was this new place

104
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,318
where everybody could could could

105
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:52,150
communicate so so again we've gone

106
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,310
through all these different eras and

107
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,919
we've all been connecting to the cloud

108
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,860
alright so you know taking back to the

109
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:02,830
IBM old mainframes you know you use

110
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,750
Teddy typewriters to control them so how

111
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,060
old is the client i I don't actually

112
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:10,569
know the answer because it's been around

113
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:14,050
for so long so so when I started to grow

114
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:16,349
up I started to build my own data

115
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:20,530
centers and course you know that

116
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:22,810
essentially is a client so I started to

117
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:25,419
build my own pride and then kind of the

118
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:30,099
last 10 15 years that the cloud as we

119
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:32,530
know is born right so strategy's started

120
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:35,590
to evolve as people start to move their

121
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:38,409
workloads to the Clyde and and of course

122
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,880
you know it's super cool isn't it it's

123
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:42,759
the Clyde it can do everything it will

124
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,199
save our it'll save our existence it

125
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,550
will be able to do all kind of a manner

126
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:47,680
of things you know all the different

127
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,080
capabilities all the different models of

128
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,659
course all the rules that we have to go

129
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,199
by to you know the road ahead for

130
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:55,900
everybody

131
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,409
you know is actually really really full

132
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:01,888
of surprises right so so you know more

133
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:04,210
often than not you know I hear people's

134
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:07,419
catastrophes of moving to the Clyde and

135
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:09,460
and not you know we're gonna start doing

136
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:11,380
he played ourselves can you give us a

137
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,638
hand with it it's always too far down

138
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,919
the line that they come back to us and

139
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,900
say actually yeah you should have taken

140
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:18,818
your advice and that and actually got

141
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,310
some some help before we started our

142
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:23,199
journey to Clyde so you know take that

143
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:28,169
as a piece of advice because of course

144
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:32,860
the aftermath you know it can be really

145
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:37,060
catastrophic so there are some good

146
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:38,169
examples of of pride topologies all

147
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,110
right we see some really good examples

148
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:42,240
of cloud but then we see some really

149
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,740
really

150
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:49,940
really bad examples of Christ all right

151
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:54,360
now this is a really interesting

152
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:56,610
important slide because I mean I I'm

153
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,580
really happy that I got that responsibly

154
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,740
on this but but it plays on something

155
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,560
called confirmation bias all right

156
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,930
so so this brings me back a little bit

157
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,710
to the kind of George Orwell times the

158
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:15,509
kind of dystopia whatever dystopia is

159
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:17,609
and you know to to to to normally we're

160
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:22,169
overrun by our own confirmation bias and

161
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:24,810
and that basically takes us away from

162
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:27,719
true fact or what has actually factually

163
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:30,210
true so so of course you take the

164
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,620
emotion away you take the bias away or

165
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,299
at least you try to take the bus away

166
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,430
now unfortunately we all have this is

167
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,860
programmed into us we can't you can't

168
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,419
change it what we can do is we can be

169
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,310
mindful of it so we can try and make

170
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:44,039
better and important decisions like I

171
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:46,919
said relying on fact and not just what

172
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:48,509
confirms your belief you know and

173
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,698
similarly you know I'm not a religious

174
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:54,690
person by any mate but by any means but

175
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:58,469
you know to judge is to be judged so you

176
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:00,300
know I always say that you know I can't

177
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:03,360
judge someone for doing something on a

178
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,460
basis that I have no authority to do so

179
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,169
you know if there's someone I mean

180
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,229
coming here today there was someone in a

181
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:13,318
in a Honda Civic wanting to go past me

182
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:15,990
at lightning speed right yeah perhaps I

183
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,610
think mmm god what a one I've got here

184
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,710
you know what what are they doing I'm

185
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:23,669
going to sit a 17 in the fast lane but

186
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:26,849
who am I to judge who can I honestly

187
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:28,049
stand up to and say well I know that

188
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:29,909
there being an idiot for trying to drive

189
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,590
fast you know they could be going to

190
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:33,360
they could be driving to go and see a

191
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,338
dying relative you know I don't know

192
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,240
that they could just be you know late

193
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,329
for work and they should have got up

194
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,909
five minutes it earlier so yeah perhaps

195
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:44,550
they are an idiot but you know at the

196
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:46,620
end of the day you can't really you know

197
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,050
judge just on the basis of that and of

198
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:52,290
course why the hackers hacks date of the

199
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,819
new oil so as we bring out all these new

200
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,650
technologies and all these new

201
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,070
things course the the threat landscape

202
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:01,110
changes so we're now seeing that the

203
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:04,170
criminals and the cyber gangs you know

204
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,880
using a lot of this new technology in

205
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,610
ways that we don't understand please we

206
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:13,170
don't see and and we have to always try

207
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:15,600
and maintain that one step ahead now my

208
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,000
course if businesses are now monetizing

209
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,920
all their data I of all the machine

210
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,170
learning algorithms that they're

211
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,110
processing against these things then

212
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,540
then of course the cyber criminal is

213
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:30,600
going to do that as well right right so

214
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:34,890
so but it's okay because we've been

215
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,760
saved right we've got quantum we've got

216
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,770
blockchain

217
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,880
we've got AI and it's gonna it's gonna

218
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:43,650
save the world it's going to

219
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:49,740
revolutionize the world of course what

220
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:53,030
what we're seeing is that release in a

221
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:57,480
lot of this so I mean what do you mean

222
00:09:53,030 --> 00:10:02,490
now we've been playing around with image

223
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,930
recognition so so obviously I hope you

224
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,930
all know how image recognition works

225
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:09,930
right you you play your algorithms into

226
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,729
into your into your a I to show a no to

227
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,800
provide we'll talk about foxes right you

228
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:18,120
want it to recognize a box you train it

229
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:20,990
with a load of theta by boxes now one

230
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:26,550
might not know that if I now stick a

231
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:29,040
picture of a of a toaster with rainbow

232
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:31,740
colors all over it I've now spoiled that

233
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:37,319
algorithm and it will now not process

234
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:39,840
Fox data will not correctly look at data

235
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,900
that pertains to being a fox so of

236
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:46,080
course you know if you think a bit D

237
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,610
provide this well you know what why

238
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,690
would I not want to start then trying to

239
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:53,070
hack people and poison their rai data

240
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:56,760
that's a perfectly good way of

241
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:59,640
sabotaging a business so in course a lot

242
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:03,330
of the time a lot of the the people that

243
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:05,750
are making these these things you know

244
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,610
have no concept of security they have no

245
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,170
ability to

246
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:14,060
be able to think about well how do I do

247
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:15,979
this securely and as everybody or just a

248
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:20,420
quick show has anybody heard of the

249
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:24,130
hypes cycle in Gartner yes okay so the

250
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:27,140
hype cycle is is a kind of theory that

251
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:29,209
when a new technology comes out there's

252
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:32,720
there's there's a hype for it and this

253
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:34,969
hype really kind of dictates how well or

254
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,279
how or how rubbish this this thing does

255
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,940
but what we always find is that there's

256
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,189
a peak and and they set that peak that

257
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,959
we realize that these technologies

258
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,120
aren't actually going to save everything

259
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,910
that they're not going to be able to

260
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,079
make us you know save the world and and

261
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,149
all the great things they get me wrong

262
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:55,550
in the future twenty thirty four years

263
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:57,320
we maybe I don't know if you can see

264
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:00,290
that's where we are at the moment with

265
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,990
machine learning so so we're just about

266
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:05,180
to drop into the trough of

267
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:08,300
disillusionment you make the trough of

268
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,790
disillusionment is that we realize that

269
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:13,819
okay this not this isn't actually going

270
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:15,890
to fix everything so you can see just

271
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,600
here we've got less than five percent of

272
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,730
the potential audience has actually

273
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,000
successfully adopted the technology

274
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:25,519
fully so that is still a few years away

275
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,640
yet so it's not going to fix everything

276
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:34,760
so how do we fix it well we all aware of

277
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:40,120
DevOps I'm hoping were mostly aware of

278
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:43,490
DevOps so that's traditional DevOps now

279
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:47,329
unfortunately for us or fortunately you

280
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:49,220
know we you know developers are going

281
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:52,489
out spitting out this lovely magical

282
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:55,040
unicorn poo and and worth going around

283
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:57,140
having to sweep it up everywhere and so

284
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,760
of course the the methodologies and the

285
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:03,500
frameworks I've come across multiple

286
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:06,459
multiple DevOps teams across not just

287
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,329
the UK but internationally as well and

288
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:11,839
everybody's got their own way of doing

289
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:14,479
it so so kind of you know what do we do

290
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:18,160
right now I like to think that security

291
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,600
is everybody's responsibility I mean

292
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,730
who's responsible for the security

293
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,920
when you leave it at the end of the day

294
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:27,170
you know do you have a security guard

295
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,439
that looks after it do you do you do you

296
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:32,360
ring up some special number to say right

297
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,069
I've left the house now it's locked it's

298
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,490
locked it's and it's alarmed it's

299
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:41,180
engaged in anything but what we do know

300
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:44,930
in in DevOps is a good buzz term which

301
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:46,849
is infrastructure as code so everybody

302
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:50,930
is aware who's aware of infrastructure

303
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:52,730
as code cool cool cool so I like to

304
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,500
think there are some good books on this

305
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:56,509
as well as coke culture as code

306
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,980
all right changing the mindset changing

307
00:13:56,509 --> 00:14:00,920
the culture because if you change the

308
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:04,610
culture then you change the way people

309
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:08,649
think and take security very very

310
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:11,660
important so who's got social media

311
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:18,350
everybody yeah I'll tell you what who

312
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:21,740
hasn't got social media cool no 101

313
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:25,899
whatever that cool so fair play

314
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:28,759
absolutely fair play you know now it's

315
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:30,740
it's a great thing right you know it's a

316
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:32,990
platform which can which can make things

317
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,509
great it's a platform where everybody

318
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,709
now has an opinion but course the

319
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:40,819
problem is when you mix that with

320
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:43,758
technology it gives people a platform to

321
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:46,819
voice their confirmation bias and course

322
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:51,199
people are emotional people are

323
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:54,170
changeable people have habits so so

324
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,329
course giving them a platform to voice

325
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:59,060
or their that their opinions and all

326
00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:03,410
their bad all their bad juju are

327
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:05,839
obviously makes real work real work with

328
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:08,110
things happen so you know never is a

329
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:13,670
time when we've been so connected that

330
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:15,380
that we that we are so divided right you

331
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,810
know a whole nation is just pretty much

332
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:20,870
being divided based on praxis and and

333
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:23,689
and the virtual that you see from both

334
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,790
sides both sides of the argument it's

335
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,170
just like you know being in a school

336
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,139
playground when these people are

337
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:32,779
actually looking after our actual world

338
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:33,380
you know so so kind of we gotta rein it

339
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:34,370
in a bit

340
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,060
now in this brings

341
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:40,820
back to kind of 1984 right because for

342
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,770
those that haven't seen it I mean I

343
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:46,670
won't spend too long talking about it

344
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:48,410
but but everyday they used to they used

345
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:51,020
to meet and watch the television it was

346
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,910
called the telescreen and they would

347
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,890
participate and participate in what they

348
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,689
called the two minutes hate right and

349
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,550
the two minutes hate was them watching

350
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,940
their their enemies their enemies of the

351
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,709
state and they would they would play

352
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:06,500
videos of these people and they would

353
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:08,960
all scream and shout abuse and and and

354
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,270
and spread their vile hatred against

355
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,950
their enemies and course the way in

356
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,230
which they manipulated the news they

357
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:18,020
manipulated the media they really kind

358
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:20,180
of you know change the way people's

359
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:23,210
perception yesterday's enemy was

360
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,829
completely forgotten by because

361
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:27,350
tomorrow's enemy is the one that's right

362
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:30,980
in front of their face so so you see

363
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,930
this now all the time all over all over

364
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:38,529
social media all over social networking

365
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:46,189
so you know again how do we fix that I

366
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:50,270
mean any any ideas for me this is really

367
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:51,680
really undervalued right it's basic it's

368
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:54,529
generally easy and it's generally

369
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,180
something all of us have every single

370
00:16:54,529 --> 00:17:00,230
one of us we all have morals and we all

371
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:02,569
have values and so kind of shift in that

372
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,490
behavior changing that culture changing

373
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,589
that mindset you know security is

374
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:10,670
everybody's responsibility you know

375
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:12,438
should help to better ourselves we'll

376
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,209
never get rid of the problem you know

377
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:18,860
we'd only have to just find new ways of

378
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:21,770
fixing the problem so so course let's

379
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:24,229
get back to the technology so DevOps

380
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:26,240
acceleration is too fast the security

381
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:28,550
that's what I hear all the time hey how

382
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,410
do we integrate with your pipelines how

383
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:33,889
do we integrate with your tool chains

384
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:36,170
because security is static security is

385
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:38,150
seen as the same no you know we're all

386
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:41,540
saying no you can't do it like that can

387
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:45,320
do like this I don't think that's right

388
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:47,240
I think security is a driver for private

389
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,330
option and insert DevOps methodologies

390
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,550
because

391
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:54,090
because you know changing that culture

392
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:57,020
changing that - set shifting to the left

393
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:59,310
you know means that they've set cops

394
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:02,580
becomes kind of part of everyone's way

395
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:05,129
of thinking and of course that way we

396
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,770
get into a much easier continual

397
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:11,430
delivery of our Clyde's and services and

398
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:13,139
solutions to be able to to keep up with

399
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:15,930
the pace of change to keep up with the

400
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:18,780
pace of Deb's DevOps and dev seconds and

401
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:21,240
making sure that all of our all of our

402
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,220
pipelines and our chains are as secure

403
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:28,110
and we're taking all the necessary steps

404
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:29,960
to to embed this in and of course there

405
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:32,429
are hundreds of tools to help us

406
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,200
absolutely hundreds of them so you know

407
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:36,600
if you don't know or not comfortable

408
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:42,120
with one try another because at the end

409
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:43,949
of the day at the end of the day you

410
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,479
know what what you're practicing

411
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:47,940
preached today will be something

412
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,400
completely different tomorrow and you

413
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:53,430
know I'm always you know having to kind

414
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,530
of change my mindset on things you know

415
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:58,320
when for instance shower two and shower

416
00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:01,590
three become bad it'll be what would it

417
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:05,189
be next char four or five six and so on

418
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:07,139
and so forth so with the clay it will

419
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,570
always change it would always have that

420
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:16,260
it will always evolve and we have to try

421
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:18,210
and be one step ahead and and and like I

422
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,250
said you know what I preach today

423
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,450
tomorrow will be something completely

424
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,360
different

425
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:26,970
now how again you know do we do we be

426
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:30,300
able to to really rate in that in how do

427
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:31,910
we how do we make sure that we're all

428
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,669
working towards a common goal

429
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:39,120
well it's pretty easy you know ethics

430
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:42,780
morals and collaboration it's work

431
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,879
together let's share ideas let's let's

432
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,700
participate in constructive criticism

433
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,530
you know and let's join let's join them

434
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,630
build a community yeah it's great seeing

435
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:56,129
everybody here today Abey sides you know

436
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:57,810
it's awesome and I battle through those

437
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:01,270
quite a bit quicker than my fault

438
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:03,850
so there's a couple of good links there

439
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:07,330
we got about 10 minutes left nine

440
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:09,570
minutes left so say are there any

441
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,570
questions

442
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:24,970
what this is a good question actually so

443
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:26,379
so we're well seeing things what we're

444
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:29,529
doing is the DevOps teams are

445
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:31,299
integrating security into them so so

446
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:34,630
rather than pulling in the security

447
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:36,429
people to come and fix their projects

448
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:40,570
fix their teams fix their their

449
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:42,399
methodologies they're employing so so in

450
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,439
some instances the larger teams are

451
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:46,120
becoming smaller because those skill

452
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,789
sets are going towards the development

453
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:51,639
side but then course you're always going

454
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:55,600
to need a higher level of of help

455
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,909
sometimes so so what I do see is those

456
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,850
teams becoming smaller from the security

457
00:20:57,909 --> 00:21:02,830
standpoint the dev ops team becoming a

458
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:48,939
little bit bigger but then still also

459
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:50,379
relying and needing to bring in well I

460
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,179
mean the thing about the cloud is the

461
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,630
shared responsibility model so you know

462
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:59,260
about the CCM matrix and the staff so

463
00:21:54,630 --> 00:22:02,559
the cloud capability model I get makes

464
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:04,629
our mark immense but look it up CCM 3.1

465
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:09,549
I think we're on our controls matrix at

466
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:12,070
the moment but you know absolutely the

467
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:14,930
good thing is is you know I talked about

468
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:18,379
this taper and utopia I mean what is

469
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:19,910
utopia you know what is does anybody

470
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,860
want to live in a perfect world where

471
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:25,100
everything's hunky-dory and really happy

472
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:28,129
and fluffy I'm not sure that people do

473
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:30,679
but but of course there becomes a

474
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:34,000
crunching point and I think we're we're

475
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:36,320
nearing that kind of critical mass where

476
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,910
you know the people will start you know

477
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,790
I'm not saying go and become especially

478
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:42,380
W and start shouting from rooftops and

479
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:45,050
tying yourself the buildings and stuff

480
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:48,700
but you know definitely I think the

481
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,700
conversations are beginning to be had so

482
00:22:51,370 --> 00:23:01,580
their second loss do you see the same

483
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:04,670
pipelines or you see yeah she said no

484
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:07,820
all part the same what about the fiscal

485
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:11,930
insider the employees pipeline delicious

486
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:13,820
connect gaining access there's always

487
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:16,460
the insider threat you can never be you

488
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:19,129
know how secure secure secure isn't an

489
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,370
end goal and say of course the problem

490
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:24,710
is as people are people you know the

491
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,939
lady before she was saying that you know

492
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:29,350
although we know what's good and what's

493
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,350
bad people still choose to do bad things

494
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:40,160
oh yeah yeah maybe you've always got you

495
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,260
you've always got to sign off right by

496
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:46,820
somebody else and that's the whole

497
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:48,379
that's the whole point the same I see

498
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:51,080
what you're getting out right so yeah so

499
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,460
obviously from from one to other yes

500
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,600
absolutely because you should always

501
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:57,980
have sign off of somebody else's work so

502
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,300
the thing about the pipeline is it may

503
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,980
still be able to come under the same

504
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:04,070
pipeline but then it will get picked up

505
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:14,450
at that QA stage when they go what hang

506
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:23,450
on what's what's this exposing 65000

507
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:25,610
course yeah yeah and that's and that's

508
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,780
what and that's why I'm seeing some and

509
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,580
don't get me wrong they're still early

510
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,080
days they they still think once the dot

511
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,520
so you know they still see securities as

512
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,710
inhibitor do you think it will sway them

513
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,720
by so a degree it does a little bit but

514
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:39,140
you know companies like Netflix can do

515
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:50,570
it then then what why aren't the rest of

516
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:53,030
us kind of probably yeah yeah little

517
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:55,399
insider actively in fact old enduring

518
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:57,530
that same deal a problem you might you

519
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:03,760
can create deal IPE to stop reduced you

520
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:12,230
couldn't have yeah

521
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:13,790
said one at the backbone anymore cool

522
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,520
