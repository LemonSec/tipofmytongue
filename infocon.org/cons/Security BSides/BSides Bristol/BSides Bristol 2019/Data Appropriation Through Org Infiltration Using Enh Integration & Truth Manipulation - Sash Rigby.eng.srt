1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,720
thanks very much so it's pretty

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,400
impressive introduction yeah quick

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,910
thanks to the organizers and volunteers

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,040
for getting besides Bristol off the

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,349
ground pretty impressive

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,939
today I'm going to be talking about this

7
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:25,600
stuff or physical red teaming and

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:27,580
realistic attack scenarios so in truth

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,070
what that really is is dressing up

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:33,670
breaking in telling fibs and hacking as

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:36,430
much as you can so today I'll be talking

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:40,000
about kind of how we get into the

13
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:42,640
buildings and warehouses and different

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,500
properties and less so much about the

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,940
techie bit about what we do once we're

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:52,899
in so I'm the technical director and

17
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:55,899
co-founder of modok's we are a boutique

18
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:58,600
consultancy based out Bristol delivering

19
00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:01,000
pen testing check testing technical

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:05,890
research but we were lucky enough to

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,500
work across telecoms finance UK gov and

22
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:14,320
we kind of hack all sorts of things from

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:17,830
servers to boats to 4G networks to bank

24
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,729
ATMs shop kiosks voting machines

25
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:24,130
whatever we're trusted with we kind of

26
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:26,470
get in and have a good time so this is

27
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,449
two of our guys tom and ben with big

28
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,210
smiles on their faces afterwards spent

29
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:35,680
ten days up in north of Scotland hacking

30
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:38,048
an automated ship which I'm sure you can

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,280
guess was amazing so that was naturally

32
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:42,850
a Red Team and that was more of the

33
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,290
technical penetration testing what we

34
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:48,149
could do with the ship so if we could

35
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,149
hack it so if we could take it somewhere

36
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:54,420
so this is meet technical director so I

37
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,220
started out as a software developer

38
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:01,210
after finishing University yesterday

39
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,490
music legal on up and I realized pretty

40
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:06,100
early on that there weren't any jobs

41
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,449
writing music for film so I decided to

42
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,478
learn how to code while I was in

43
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,400
university got some freelance work and

44
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,020
the company I was working for got hacked

45
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,860
and I was really interested in how that

46
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,810
happened and

47
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,610
surely after moved into security and

48
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,890
I've been working in security for well

49
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:25,480
over ten years now I lose count yeah

50
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:27,279
same as a lot of people here kind of it

51
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,530
helps to have a bit of a cheeky side as

52
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,030
well and yeah I'm sure as you know

53
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:34,300
there's a quarry a lot of hackers in the

54
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,190
room kind of helps if you can build a

55
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:41,050
career out of it

56
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:44,609
so this is me last slide is poori

57
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:48,610
obvious that passes a bit photoshopped

58
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:53,380
that's okay so is that one and so is

59
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:56,860
that one and so is that one so it

60
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:58,720
doesn't really matter how good your

61
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,840
photoshopping skills are you can kind of

62
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,390
use a lot of pretty loose techniques to

63
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,250
kind of appear like you're where you're

64
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,829
supposed to be just with a simple pass

65
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:12,660
and a lanyard so I like to carry quite a

66
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:16,210
few it's a four on site obviously

67
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,490
distraction as you can so when we're

68
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:21,700
going on site we do take as many of

69
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:24,010
these as we can get so missing a purple

70
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,170
one if anyone's got perform in the

71
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,170
market for a purple lanyard mum for a

72
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,510
job that's coming up so this pass

73
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:37,630
actually I did tell a lie is not

74
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:40,738
photoshopped this pass was made on a

75
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,970
machine in the clients reception and

76
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,010
they were kind enough to put a camera in

77
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,200
so it's supposed to take your photo and

78
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,030
print out the past and I held up my

79
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,200
phone with a picture of Super Mario on

80
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:55,690
it as it took the photo and then entered

81
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,519
my details in and because the guys on

82
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,650
the security desk is so used to just

83
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,090
seeing these visitor passes sure enough

84
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,760
when you walk up and you say our youngs

85
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,260
and hits a superior whoever they just

86
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,549
swing the gate then you go on in and

87
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,480
kind of starting to work so again it's

88
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,459
not it's not crazy

89
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,010
technical hacking but it's just being a

90
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:16,630
bit cheeky and with this pass has

91
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,310
certainly happened to us twice were

92
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,048
security guards have actually approached

93
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,030
us and said excuse me

94
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:24,609
you kind of seem to be in the wrong area

95
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:27,520
with this pass we were sat outside the

96
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,060
CEOs office in a couch area and we

97
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,430
thought it was a

98
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,010
breakout area just for all staff and we

99
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:36,400
had kind of antennas trying to get pick

100
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:40,000
up the wireless signal and the

101
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,849
receptionist for the CEO asked us you

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,070
know what why you sat here and called

103
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,230
security over and the security guard

104
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:50,320
first thing doesn't grabs the pass and

105
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:52,120
he sees the name and the logo that was

106
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,430
in the top left it says oh it's no

107
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,190
problem yeah they're with us and just

108
00:04:54,430 --> 00:05:02,110
let us go about making the wireless

109
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:04,870
faster so red teaming I'm sure you've

110
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,639
all heard of it so why do we do it so

111
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,860
it's important for us to really

112
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,360
highlight key areas for improvement in

113
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,190
the organization so a lot of

114
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,280
organizations are going to have policies

115
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:17,050
on how they secure their systems how

116
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,609
they secure access to buildings and how

117
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,680
they segregate privilege within their

118
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,320
organizations it's really important that

119
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,450
we can highlight those vulnerabilities

120
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,669
but also we're going to be focused on

121
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,320
the gaps and everyone continually is

122
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:31,120
getting focused on the controls and

123
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,520
everyone's proud about the controls that

124
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,200
they put in but it's our job to kind of

125
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,150
rip up the rulebook and just say well

126
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,060
actually you're smokers leave the door

127
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,620
open every time on a Monday between

128
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,120
11:00 and we can just get in through

129
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,830
that door so it doesn't matter

130
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,600
necessarily about the policies and the

131
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,159
processes it's really important for us

132
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,860
to go and highlight those gaps that we

133
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,400
see on the day we can change our

134
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,830
abilities as well so a lot of pen tests

135
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,299
are really quite tightly scoped so if

136
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,250
we're given free rein over an

137
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,100
organization and if that's globally

138
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,900
maybe we can travel as well we're able

139
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,970
to chain those vulnerabilities to get

140
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,099
into that first server and we're able to

141
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,169
escalate up through the organization and

142
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:15,370
really prove the concept that we can go

143
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:17,740
from a real low access level to turning

144
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:20,080
the whole company and of course it's a

145
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:23,340
bit silly and we love it and it's great

146
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,169
that we get to sell this kind of work so

147
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,849
the approach is to focus on high risks

148
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:30,190
so we're not really interested in

149
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,600
cross-site scripting and a TLS

150
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,090
certificate that's out of date on a

151
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,680
server or you know maybe there's a

152
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,570
barrier that lets you into the carpark

153
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,400
we don't really care about this kind of

154
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,770
stuff we're only going to focus and

155
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,840
report on stuff that gets us in

156
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:46,508
to the company so a lot of the time

157
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,729
we'll be throwing away stuff that we

158
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:51,129
don't care about so we'll see a lot and

159
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:53,050
it might be a security risk and it could

160
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:54,490
be great to pad out a report but we're

161
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,340
not interested in that stuff we're only

162
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:59,440
interested in the stuff that gets us the

163
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:03,460
quickest route into controlling the

164
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,560
organization and is sample based as well

165
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,388
so we're not sampling every door in an

166
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,690
organization not sampling every server

167
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:14,050
it's really just about picking where we

168
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:15,400
think that we can use technology and

169
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,080
weaknesses to get as into the

170
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,659
organization and it helps us identify

171
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,849
really weak corporate structure so a lot

172
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:24,099
of these gaps in policy due to people

173
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:27,719
not communicating properly or people not

174
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:31,360
following process that's the boring bit

175
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,710
so getting in we can go in through Wi-Fi

176
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,159
obviously we can try and hack the

177
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:39,008
wireless crack hashes and the rest of it

178
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:41,349
we can try fishing which is really

179
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:43,030
successful we can go on site into

180
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:45,099
buildings and we can go in through the

181
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,289
internet and through industry specific

182
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:50,949
stuff so like I mentioned ATMs and

183
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:53,318
kiosks and the rescue it so problems

184
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:55,030
with Wi-Fi it's quite time-consuming so

185
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:56,560
on a Monday you walk around you've got

186
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,059
to start collecting packets you've got

187
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,000
to hope that people are connected to the

188
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:05,199
right access points it can also be

189
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,819
secured so using it can be secured with

190
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,370
a conversation you know we can ask the

191
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:11,319
client bar using certificates using WPA

192
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:13,270
enterprise and if they are then we can

193
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,130
oh it's probably fairly secure up to a

194
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,599
point but if they're not doing that then

195
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:19,779
there's probably a way into the wireless

196
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:24,069
network so that doesn't necessarily need

197
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:25,630
a full-on red team but it can yeah why

198
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:27,430
this can definitely be secured and

199
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,319
actually why this is one of the main

200
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,630
things that slows us up on the red team

201
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:34,149
if there aren't any Ethernet ports and

202
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,559
the secure wireless that can make it

203
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:37,570
really really difficult to get access

204
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:40,059
into an organization once we're in the

205
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:45,070
building well come on how we do that

206
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:48,969
lady phishing it works so inevitably if

207
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:51,550
you've got a large organization you're

208
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,290
gonna get in through fishing so again we

209
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,390
don't necessarily have to put that in

210
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,849
our Red Team methodology because

211
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:59,980
no it's gonna work and we can work with

212
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,380
the client to understand how they're

213
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,240
going to potentially be fished and what

214
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,130
things that they can have their email

215
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,280
boundary that's going to help stop them

216
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,530
getting fish

217
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:16,300
we were running a job two weeks ago for

218
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:20,290
a very strange financial investment firm

219
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:24,760
out of Paris and they were a company of

220
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:26,680
only about 150 people and even within

221
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,220
that 150 people we had two people

222
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,479
finally open the final payload so you

223
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,880
know if you've got that is approximately

224
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,770
you know 1/2 percent of people opening

225
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,580
it in a larger organization that's

226
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:40,530
definitely going to get you in so time

227
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,390
well-spent

228
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:45,189
compromised through buildings again

229
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,689
we've got a hundred percent success rate

230
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,280
of getting into buildings and then

231
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,430
getting onto the network following that

232
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:53,140
web applications for larger organization

233
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,089
this is a really really brilliant way in

234
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,800
because you can start to fingerprint the

235
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,900
organization from the internet and

236
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,630
there's no real way that you're gonna

237
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,550
get caught or detected in that initial

238
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:05,800
fingerprinting stage so you can spend a

239
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,449
lot of time just crawling the web sites

240
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,870
understanding the technology they have

241
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:13,090
and again eventually you will get in and

242
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:16,930
through industry specific technology so

243
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:19,870
we one of the most alarming projects

244
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:22,300
that we did in 2017 we were able to

245
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,970
compromise a large organization through

246
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,680
the 4G network that they provide and we

247
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,480
were able to do that globally as well so

248
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,969
going in through the user equipment

249
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,440
through the core network and onto the

250
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,930
enterprise network and we got domain

251
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,110
admin ultimately through the user of

252
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:40,359
Gooden and again a lot of these things

253
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,910
is about persistence so if you can kind

254
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,680
of spend enough time trying to get in

255
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,079
through something eventually if you've

256
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,180
got enough knowledge you will eventually

257
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,240
be able to get in so today I'm going to

258
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,910
be focused on physical security so we're

259
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,620
looking at getting into head offices

260
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:59,650
branches and shops data centers and

261
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:02,800
third parties so head office obviously

262
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:04,390
this is often more secure than a lot of

263
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,040
the other locations because people think

264
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,649
that's where their crown jewels are also

265
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,589
forgetting the fact that network

266
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:13,389
kind of leaves the building branches and

267
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:14,829
shops can be a great one because then

268
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:16,600
you're up against staff that maybe

269
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:19,388
haven't been trained in the same way as

270
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,920
people in head offices so we've been

271
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:25,329
able to get into the backroom caps of

272
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,339
different companies that have shops and

273
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:29,859
going through kiosks and things like

274
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:32,079
this and get access to the enterprise

275
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,879
network and get domain admin whilst the

276
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,189
SAC you know in hive is in the back of

277
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:37,809
shop and then it's I mean it's not

278
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:40,599
necessarily a fair assessment of

279
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:42,490
training and awareness but it's because

280
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:47,139
you know maybe because I knew that day

281
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:48,819
or but actually it helps highlight the

282
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:51,189
network's to get the segregation from

283
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:53,079
the shops and it's kind of highlights a

284
00:11:51,189 --> 00:11:56,309
lot of the different layers within the

285
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:58,628
organization and potentially need fixing

286
00:11:56,309 --> 00:12:00,399
data centers are getting harder and

287
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:02,410
harder to get into I mean you can dress

288
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,269
like a techie but still a lot of the

289
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:06,550
time you'll have barriers that are kind

290
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:08,920
of weighing you or they're using iris

291
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:11,589
scanners and the rest of it so they're

292
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,809
getting harder and third parties is a

293
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:16,540
great way to compromise an organization

294
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:18,100
if you can get it signed off that the

295
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:21,660
third party's in scope and get that

296
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:26,769
agreed then that can be a brilliant way

297
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:29,620
so there is stages again if any of you

298
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:31,179
are pen testers or you know you've seen

299
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,069
pen test reports there's a lot of the

300
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:35,170
similar stages of how we're getting into

301
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:39,699
the network when we're using physical

302
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:43,240
means so from our point of view

303
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:46,479
we're often working with large

304
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:49,959
organizations that based out the UK but

305
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,839
they are global as well so for us when

306
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:55,569
we're picking a target we like to pick

307
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:58,679
if we can at least some of the countries

308
00:12:55,569 --> 00:13:00,729
that are maybe not as advanced

309
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:04,240
technologically or necessarily in their

310
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:06,249
security attitudes so even a country

311
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,589
such as Portugal their attitudes can

312
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:10,059
still be quite different South Africa

313
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:11,829
has been an amazing country that we've

314
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:14,230
worked in multiple times for different

315
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:16,029
companies and in those kind of countries

316
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,709
you can kind of walk up you've got the

317
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,629
English accent and you walk up and you

318
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:20,399
just say oh hi I'm from head office I

319
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:22,589
forgot my pad

320
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,360
can I get in today and they'll just open

321
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:26,730
the barrier and send you up to security

322
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,120
to get your temporary pass so I was I've

323
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,680
actually had a pass issued I needed it

324
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,790
for a week and they issued it for a

325
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,709
month just in case the culture can be

326
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:40,980
really different as well so people are

327
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:42,809
often a lot more relaxed in these

328
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,399
developing countries where maybe they

329
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:46,139
they've seen that they can just send

330
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,199
reports back to the UK and say

331
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:50,850
everything's a-okay and actually on the

332
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,160
ground everyone's chilling out the

333
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:55,439
barriers are permanently open everyone's

334
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,540
just saying hey yeah come on in and you

335
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:59,730
have a good time in advanced countries

336
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,559
especially in northern Europe people are

337
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,689
a lot more polite so even if you have

338
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,459
got your past lives touched away because

339
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:07,800
you haven't managed to print it or even

340
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:09,239
if you have got something that's a

341
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,339
little bit of mist maybe you're landing

342
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,319
on to the wrong colour or maybe you are

343
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:15,540
in the wrong area people are still a bit

344
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:17,729
too polite so in Germany and Netherlands

345
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,740
we see this a lot where people won't

346
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,920
confront you and you can kind of ride on

347
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,410
that subsidiaries and acquisitions are

348
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,209
our favourites so any company that's

349
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,980
been recently bought in the last few

350
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:31,920
years they'll really have a lot of

351
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,660
cultural pushback and they won't want to

352
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,209
integrate culturally into the

353
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,069
organisation but their parent company

354
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,869
would have still wanted to plug every

355
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:42,179
one in put them on the same email

356
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:44,220
account to get the branding sorted but

357
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:46,139
at the personnel level everyone kind of

358
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:49,529
thinks they know better and they know

359
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:51,089
that you know what these rules that are

360
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:53,370
coming down from head office aren't

361
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:55,199
necessarily right fit for their company

362
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,809
so again maybe you are from head office

363
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:00,660
or whatever your back story might be you

364
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:02,730
can definitely use that where the the

365
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,589
subsidiary hasn't quite adopted to the

366
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:09,179
security policies in the way of working

367
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:12,449
that head office would prefer and again

368
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:14,910
with the subsidiaries point productivity

369
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:16,740
is the main goal right often so you know

370
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,509
it's really important that everyone's

371
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,519
just getting plugged in and we can get

372
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:22,679
working everyone on the same system so

373
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,660
productivity is probably one of the main

374
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:26,999
things as we all know that actually

375
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:30,679
slows up security and people might say

376
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:33,299
it's the other way around sometimes so

377
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,079
another way to do recon we've all done

378
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,850
it before we go

379
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,310
meeting or we go on site we're using

380
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:42,470
Google Maps or Google Earth to kind of

381
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:47,790
give us a heads up so this was a bit of

382
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:50,940
recon that I did for a hobby job on the

383
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:53,730
weekend is poori not fair that I put up

384
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:57,269
videos of recon from any of our clients

385
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:59,670
so this is a landmark in London that was

386
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:04,920
actually able to get access to out of

387
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:06,410
hours on the weekend and it's these kind

388
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,229
of things you can just use a bit of

389
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:12,000
open-source information it's kind of

390
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,380
just guide you before you're on site to

391
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,029
give you an idea and it's not

392
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,800
necessarily gonna tell you how you're

393
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:18,839
gonna get in it's just gonna help

394
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,240
familiarize you with the building and

395
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:23,970
give you a sense of what to expect when

396
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:30,300
you're there and then this little video

397
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:34,850
friends don't do this but you can if you

398
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:37,500
but sure we can do what you want so

399
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:40,290
another really really decent source of

400
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,899
information is the planning office so

401
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:44,699
you'll get floor plans for most modern

402
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,520
buildings from a planning office and

403
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,829
even if this office has restricted areas

404
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:53,819
or areas that don't necessarily need to

405
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:55,319
be in the plans architects want to get

406
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,970
those plans through and that's what

407
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,700
they're good at so they'll provide as

408
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:02,550
much information as they can to really

409
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,589
help set the scene for what developments

410
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,839
are going to happen in that building so

411
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:08,760
this is one from actually Huey I didn't

412
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:11,970
have time to find anything juice juicy

413
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,770
unfortunately but you can see the

414
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:17,130
architects love just putting as much

415
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:19,579
detail as they can in so stuff that

416
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:22,380
might not even be relevant you can help

417
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:25,619
get a lot of information before you

418
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,600
arrive on site and again in the past it

419
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,370
has helped us a lot maybe we see a fire

420
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,230
escape connects to a door that goes to a

421
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,489
basement and we found that some

422
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,280
basements are connected to other

423
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:37,620
buildings so we have learned stuff from

424
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:41,160
planning offices that we didn't know

425
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,600
being an outsider I'm not really sure

426
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,940
what the remedy for this is because

427
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,419
again productivity is important so it's

428
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,560
important

429
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,480
these companies are getting their

430
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:51,360
buildings modified in getting the plans

431
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,770
through but from a Red Team perspective

432
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,629
yet just be aware that you can get a lot

433
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,990
of information from planning offices

434
00:17:54,630 --> 00:18:00,450
another thing cameras more than 2.5

435
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,880
meters in height require planning

436
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,200
permission so again this is from Yui

437
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,630
and they're planning on putting new

438
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,250
cameras up so you can see the location

439
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,050
and the direction that the cameras going

440
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,280
to be pointing and again you might think

441
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,899
well this is this getting bit

442
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,120
unrealistic now but actually we do have

443
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,240
security guards that are following us on

444
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,179
cameras and we've spent up to 45 minutes

445
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,670
before in fire escapes hiding from the

446
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,460
cameras waiting for them to forget about

447
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:29,340
us and hoping that we can kind of get

448
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,410
out fire escape and yeah we've had some

449
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,970
close shaves but finding areas that

450
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:37,680
aren't covered by cameras has definitely

451
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:40,860
helped us another brilliant source of

452
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,240
information for getting inside buildings

453
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,209
that you don't necessarily have a lot of

454
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,850
information about architects and

455
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,920
interior designers they really want to

456
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:52,560
promote their work on Instagram or on

457
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:55,710
their website whereas the client our

458
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,240
client and their client has Velen they

459
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:00,840
might want to keep that stuff a bit

460
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:03,510
secret so this is from a real job where

461
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:07,199
there was no way of finding out the

462
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:09,960
layout or the interior of the client's

463
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,790
building but with a bit of research we

464
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,000
were able to find the interior design

465
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:16,530
and this this these shots did actually

466
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,180
really help us get access to the

467
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:21,690
building because what we've got here

468
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:23,430
we've got a shared meeting space but we

469
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,400
can see at the front entrance

470
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:28,350
we've got receptionists so if we want to

471
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,340
get into this part of the building we're

472
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,169
going to have to have a pretty good

473
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,870
story of why we want to be in this space

474
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:36,000
and this meeting room specifically

475
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:39,149
connected to buildings via a glass

476
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,830
walkway and we were trying to get onto

477
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,260
the other side of this glass walkway and

478
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:46,020
at that point we didn't know that there

479
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:48,570
was another way in which we later found

480
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,129
but we were very focused on this area so

481
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,689
we knew that we would definitely need a

482
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:54,180
producing backstory if we found

483
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,130
ourselves here anyway

484
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,900
we did find ourselves there and sure

485
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,860
enough the security guard asked us where

486
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,690
our password

487
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:05,129
we've been able to get into the building

488
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:08,130
without a pass and yeah this is kind of

489
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:10,409
where it led to us hiding in the stairs

490
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,940
because we said our passes are on our

491
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:14,250
desk we're just going to get them yeah

492
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:17,010
and as I'm hammering the lift too close

493
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:18,210
he's walking up saying oh yeah I'll come

494
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,679
with you I'll come with you it's like no

495
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,570
no it's fine we're going up to the fifth

496
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,190
floor we'll be back we'll be back and

497
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,850
then we ran down the stairs and hid for

498
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,960
45 minutes but at least we kind of knew

499
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,149
that we were going to expect to be

500
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,500
questioned whether you make a plan

501
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:34,820
around that or not so I guess it's

502
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:37,440
entirely up to you the same building

503
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,639
from the outside again Google Earth we

504
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,740
can see that the stairs are going to

505
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:42,120
lead up and from the shape of the

506
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,130
windows we can see the windows are

507
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,709
different on each floor so we kind of

508
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:49,500
could somewhat surmise that maybe these

509
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:51,809
windows are from that first floor and

510
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,039
sure enough we understood where that

511
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:58,980
room was going to be in the building

512
00:20:53,039 --> 00:21:02,480
before we were even there yep and

513
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:05,250
shaking classic classic corporate vibes

514
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,779
another thing is really important from

515
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,549
these kind of things so we can see there

516
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:10,350
we can really get a sense of the dress

517
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:13,230
code in that building and again you want

518
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,340
to blend in you if you turn up in a suit

519
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,570
in some buildings

520
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:20,428
you're gonna look massively out of place

521
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:24,840
this is Ben and Dmitry when we were

522
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:27,419
trying to break into the 4G network hi

523
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,740
this can go a long way but again as soon

524
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,690
as you find yourself on a corporate

525
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,250
floor with everyone in a suit is that

526
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,519
really the most appropriate thing to be

527
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:38,000
wearing I find that a suit with high vis

528
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,289
it's kind of puts you right at the top

529
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,789
because then you're that you're this

530
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:43,470
you're the boss of the guy that's

531
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:45,090
wearing high vis and you're probably

532
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,559
doing something that no one else needs

533
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:49,980
to know about so you can just go about

534
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,990
your day full casual more and more

535
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,139
that's pretty common dress code in

536
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:57,929
offices especially you know if there's a

537
00:21:55,139 --> 00:22:00,570
technical company so again don't go

538
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:02,549
turning up to a technical company

539
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:05,070
wearing a suit because no one's going to

540
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:06,809
greet you with a friendly face and

541
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:09,120
everyone's going to be questioning who

542
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:13,619
you are and why you sat at their hot

543
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:16,198
desk so on-site prep

544
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:19,049
at the time is anyone give me a shout on

545
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:23,279
time I'm good thanks

546
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:27,299
so this is pretty much all we need to

547
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:30,149
take as well as a laptop of course so

548
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:32,668
we've got the Selphy printer so this is

549
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:35,849
the printer that I print out classes so

550
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:39,690
most of the passes that I take have been

551
00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:41,698
printed out in a cafe so this is about

552
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:45,329
100 quid and it will print out you can

553
00:22:41,699 --> 00:22:47,399
actually buy the the card shaped paper

554
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:50,399
that will just stick directly onto a

555
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:53,399
blank then we've got the proxmark three

556
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:55,498
again between 100 and 200 pounds you can

557
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:57,208
clone passes with this so once you are

558
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:59,099
in a building maybe you want to start

559
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:03,509
bumping into people then we've got a

560
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:05,009
Raspberry Pi for them by passing on a

561
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:06,859
network or maybe we can create a bridge

562
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:11,039
with that and then the classic Alfa

563
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:12,839
another bit that is important if you do

564
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,119
get into a meeting room and maybe you

565
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:17,009
settle down you might want to lock your

566
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,889
laptop up because we've had it before

567
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:21,839
where we've not want to leave a meeting

568
00:23:19,889 --> 00:23:23,939
room because we've got a decent place to

569
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:25,619
sit we've gone to get a bite to eat in

570
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,679
the canteen and come back and our

571
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:34,069
laptops have gone missing so yeah

572
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:37,649
lock them up if you can more importantly

573
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:40,408
take your time so I say to everyone

574
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:43,258
that's on the team it's Monday we're not

575
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:44,969
getting in today whether we do get in or

576
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:47,279
not on the Monday it's important to

577
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:49,049
really dial it back and take your time

578
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,479
and just watch how the organization

579
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:54,029
works watch how people operate watch

580
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:56,969
where security guards go and just have a

581
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:59,669
coffee and just just become part of the

582
00:23:56,969 --> 00:24:02,099
space and just really chill out because

583
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:03,509
if you go rushing in there and full of

584
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:07,109
energy and full of hype you're gonna

585
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:10,049
screw up this is a fire escape that we

586
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:12,059
got in through and this was opposite a

587
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:14,549
coffee shop so we were sat just having a

588
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:16,168
coffee and from the floor plans we

589
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:18,440
already knew that these two doors went

590
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:21,419
to different parts of the building but

591
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,039
security guard on the right door with

592
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,959
the uniform of the company we were

593
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,799
trying to get into kept coming in and

594
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:29,070
out and doing as

595
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:31,710
from this door so we knew if we try and

596
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:33,299
tailgate someone in a smoker or the rest

597
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,119
of it on the left side we're going to

598
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:37,559
end up in the wrong part of the building

599
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:40,350
another thing we do is walk round and we

600
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:43,619
take photos of people's passes so before

601
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:45,330
we're actually in a restricted area we

602
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:47,639
just walk around again taking our time

603
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:50,158
with a cup of tea and just take so many

604
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:57,949
photos as you can of people and their

605
00:24:50,159 --> 00:25:00,330
passes hey yeah yeah yeah of course yeah

606
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:02,190
I'll come onto this one in a bit yeah

607
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,710
this is this is very very important

608
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:07,470
photo actually yet so this guy's called

609
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:08,820
Dean he was head of security at a

610
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:11,820
company that we're trying to break into

611
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,649
and unfortunately he's been tipped off

612
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,239
that we were coming he hadn't hired us

613
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:16,889
the word got around that there's some

614
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:19,350
people there trying to break into the

615
00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:21,149
building and I have to put him in

616
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:23,580
because it was hilarious watching him on

617
00:25:21,149 --> 00:25:25,889
the walkie-talkie operating trying to

618
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,389
spot these hackers that are coming and I

619
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:29,428
managed to get pretty close and when he

620
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:30,748
had no idea what a hacker actually looks

621
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:35,789
like when they're trying to break into a

622
00:25:30,749 --> 00:25:39,749
building so this is Alex I asked Alex to

623
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:42,330
send me a photo of him looking smart so

624
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:50,549
I could make him a fake pass so thanks

625
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:54,029
Alex so in the cafe I decided to smarten

626
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:59,309
Alex up a little bit find a guy in a

627
00:25:54,029 --> 00:26:00,989
suit if I could so I mean not every

628
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:05,070
suits appropriate when you're trying to

629
00:26:00,989 --> 00:26:06,690
break into a building but ya can smile

630
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,178
now takes up here a little bit was a bit

631
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:12,529
of Ryan Gosling

632
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:14,759
so this was done from a cafe and

633
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:16,379
unfortunately so this was using an

634
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:18,299
online program called Pixlr which is

635
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:20,340
kind of an online photoshop so there's

636
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:22,440
you know again it doesn't have to be

637
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:26,580
perfect the work you're doing it's not

638
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:28,470
going in vogue although this could it

639
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,210
just has to pass the kind of passing eye

640
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,309
test where someone glances down they're

641
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:36,809
kind of like oh oh you work for us yeah

642
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:39,470
he's a bit of jazzy guy as well and

643
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:39,470
again so

644
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,228
what we see in corporate offices as well

645
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:44,519
a lot of the passes of really really

646
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:46,379
simple because they don't need to be a

647
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:51,719
complex design so more often than not

648
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:53,580
they're pretty easy to forge and there

649
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:55,559
we go that that was printed out on this

650
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,119
printer and it got us into the building

651
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:00,299
and just helped us operate and just look

652
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:03,509
a little bit more well maybe not a

653
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:05,969
lights but I mean who wouldn't want that

654
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:11,309
guy working for them maybe head of sales

655
00:27:05,969 --> 00:27:30,239
or something so yeah the reason it's

656
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:34,279
that photo see if we got audio here hi

657
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:40,559
Luke I've been the office and mother

658
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:43,200
yeah okay yeah just with Luke up in the

659
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:47,969
office and he's saying there's a 95 it

660
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:51,210
needs to custom look at the printer can

661
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:56,039
you give him access to behind the desk

662
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:59,669
we'll give him whatever he needs okay

663
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:03,408
pointy round in maybe five minutes I

664
00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:06,029
guess these are point engine printer and

665
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:06,419
yeah just tell them that wherever needs

666
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:14,249
it

667
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:17,700
yeah okay cool very much so yeah at that

668
00:28:14,249 --> 00:28:19,469
point we tried to get in through the

669
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,999
back entrance and security said our

670
00:28:19,469 --> 00:28:24,779
maybe you guys aren't supposed to be

671
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:27,330
here so I made that call

672
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:30,809
so hence me taking the actual photo of

673
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:32,789
Lucy's past and just called the main

674
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:34,229
number of the office has to be put

675
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:37,379
through to Lucy and the guy that

676
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:39,539
answered said oh hi yeah Luke here

677
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:41,789
having a health and then so he patched

678
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:43,739
me through and I'm coming from the

679
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:46,950
internal number to Lucy and said hi is

680
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:49,619
that Lucy dams coming down basically and

681
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:51,570
Danny was there for three hours just

682
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:52,889
plugged into the printer and just doing

683
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,490
what he needed to do and sure enough

684
00:28:52,889 --> 00:28:56,659
who's on

685
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:59,790
corporate office network at that point

686
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:04,530
another way in a lot of you would have

687
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:06,600
seen these keypads the if you ever see

688
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:08,670
this keypad it's really really easy to

689
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:12,870
bypass the same as you would on one of

690
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:15,320
those combination locks of a bike if you

691
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:18,419
put the pressure on the turn knob

692
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,189
whichever is the hardest to push pin

693
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:23,550
that's the foot the next one that you

694
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:27,740
should push push so if you fully lock it

695
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:30,540
on obviously press see first lock the

696
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:33,179
dial fully on give it some pressure and

697
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,830
just press whichever button is the next

698
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:36,540
hardest in your workout the combination

699
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,980
and the thing about those combinations

700
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,440
is that doesn't matter which order they

701
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:43,800
go in so people often or list is three

702
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,059
nine six wherever that one was it

703
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,490
doesn't matter the order you press them

704
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:49,320
in so you just lock it on and just find

705
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:51,660
whichever is the most firm and it will

706
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,010
the next one two pushes it'll be really

707
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:56,550
really different to all than the others

708
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:58,020
so yeah that's pretty typical either if

709
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:01,110
there are no locks that you can easily

710
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:02,309
bypass again a hotel card or some other

711
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:04,889
card that you don't really care about

712
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:07,800
can be used to shim the lock so this was

713
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:11,820
in a car park in the basement of an

714
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:13,379
office in Munich again luckily I don't

715
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,750
know if it's Germany or the privacy

716
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,940
thing but there was no CCTV in the car

717
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,940
park so just spend five minutes trying

718
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,679
to bypass this door and got in through a

719
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:27,780
fire escape door and then we were in the

720
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:30,809
office and then once we're in we spend a

721
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:32,790
lot of time in basements poking around

722
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:35,070
looking for things that might be of

723
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:37,770
interest and again a lot of these really

724
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:40,200
large buildings have quite industrial

725
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:43,080
basements where they go through air and

726
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,000
water and the rest of it which is so

727
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,530
yeah of course so this network did

728
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,030
actually give us corporate access but

729
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:49,830
what we were also able to do this the

730
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,780
red roots are there that had internet

731
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:53,490
access so we were able to bridge the

732
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,260
corporate network to the Internet if we

733
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:59,610
wanted to to give us decent persistent

734
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:02,490
access that way these boxes were all

735
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:06,149
empty cardboard boxes in the basement on

736
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:07,320
another job and again what we were able

737
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:11,010
to do here is take

738
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,720
Mack address from that Mack and clone

739
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,370
the MAC address and of course Maxon

740
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,980
attached to the domain as easy as

741
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:18,719
Windows PCs and so that helped us

742
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:22,710
authenticate to the wireless just on a

743
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,120
Mac whitelist so you got once you're in

744
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,500
keep your eyes pealed right and keep

745
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:29,000
your technical mind on and be like oh

746
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:31,910
well yeah we've this might come abuse

747
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,190
yeah more basements can be a bit boring

748
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:38,970
so we really want to be where everyone

749
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:43,590
else is just upstairs smiling and

750
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:45,240
getting a cup of tea it feels really

751
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:47,879
good once you're in but it comes at a

752
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,590
bit of a cost this was Danny's heart

753
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,500
rate after a security guard had been

754
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:54,530
chasing his round

755
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:56,520
Danny hadn't run at this point

756
00:31:54,530 --> 00:32:00,420
whatsoever I'm sure he has in his life

757
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:01,860
but at this point we still just walking

758
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,110
around the building and his heart rates

759
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:06,179
up at 140 so even though we're kind of

760
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:08,429
allowed to be there you've got so many

761
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:10,020
doubled lies going on in your head it's

762
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:12,500
hard to keep track of what's going to

763
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:16,170
happen when you do actually get caught

764
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:17,430
so the main challenges once we're in for

765
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,980
the techies it's going to be obvious so

766
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:23,060
Ethernet access network access control

767
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:28,170
and kind of drifting into the wrong area

768
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:29,940
the biggest problem is food so prep and

769
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:32,130
make sure you got snacks in your bag

770
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,590
because you're gonna get hungry and once

771
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:36,570
you're in maybe you get into an area

772
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,010
that you can't leave or if you do leave

773
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:41,550
it's going to be difficult to get back

774
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:43,470
in that area so take snacks and settle

775
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,690
down somewhere and make sure you've got

776
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:48,300
enough for lunch and a decent afternoon

777
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:50,180
snack so getting around the ethernet

778
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:54,870
security a little bit of techie stuff

779
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:56,580
before we wrap up so often printers are

780
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:58,409
a bit more done than the rest of the

781
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:01,560
devices on the network so we're going to

782
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:03,330
have you know mschap wealth education

783
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,460
and network access control on the

784
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:07,439
network that's going to slow us up from

785
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:09,600
plugging our own laptops in what we can

786
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,580
do is plug into a printer port often

787
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,139
clone the MAC address of the printer and

788
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:15,000
it's going to help fast trackers on to

789
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,680
the network and of course people need to

790
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,840
see that printer so we're going to have

791
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,320
direct access to if nothing else at

792
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,709
least

793
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:25,050
workstations so there we were plugged in

794
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:26,850
and on that printer luckily in that area

795
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:28,710
there was an out-of-order sign just

796
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:30,330
knocking around so we just put that on

797
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,640
the printer and people coming up trying

798
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:34,080
to print and because they thought we

799
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,850
were the print team we were getting

800
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,919
roped into helping people print their

801
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:41,250
work from the other printer and the

802
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:44,970
hours really held my bets at 14 trying

803
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:47,130
to print a word documents down hard so

804
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:49,050
yeah you can see we're just plugged in

805
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:51,780
and we're kind of happy as Larry another

806
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:53,430
way getting around port security so you

807
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:57,180
can actually configure a Raspberry Pi

808
00:33:53,430 --> 00:34:00,660
pretty easily to act as a bridge and

809
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:02,340
that will help you get packets on the

810
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,200
network whilst you're looking like a

811
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:09,540
computer that's supposed to be on the

812
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:12,929
network so you can put this in between a

813
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:16,380
router and a computer that will

814
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:18,750
authenticate to the Mac and you can

815
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:21,860
inject packets onto that Raspberry Pi

816
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:26,130
and they'll put it onto the network as a

817
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:30,030
as the computer that you've you've had

818
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:31,380
authenticated to the port there's a we

819
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,880
have our own scripts to do that and

820
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:34,860
they'll power up the Raspberry Pi and

821
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,660
look for a Gateway and look for packets

822
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:39,570
but I'm pretty sure there's some stuff

823
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:41,639
on github that all just put you in the

824
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:44,160
right spot with that being in the right

825
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:46,620
place so again a meeting room if you can

826
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,210
book a meeting room out get it for as

827
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,130
long as you can so just put the meeting

828
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:52,050
room out for the week and you're good

829
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,800
and because we're in such polite

830
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:55,020
countries

831
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,850
no one's gonna pop their head in no

832
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,980
one's going to do anything so for this

833
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:01,170
meeting room here we did it actually go

834
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,180
in through the conference system and we

835
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:05,490
have this TV off the wall we have the

836
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:07,500
cable splayed out for the whole week

837
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:09,450
just so if you get access onto the

838
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,860
network and no one disturbed there's no

839
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:12,620
one said hey what you do in and the rest

840
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,910
of it so we were all good

841
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,470
building persistence so once you're in

842
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:18,359
what you want to do so you can start

843
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:21,180
cloning the easier cards that are left

844
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,890
secure you can steal visitor passes if

845
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:25,140
you can so if you can get to behind

846
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:26,609
reception or if you can get to a spot in

847
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,230
the building maybe there's a bin where

848
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,940
people dump their passes at the end of

849
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,530
the day just keep your eyes peeled for

850
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,150
any passes they're going to help you

851
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:35,220
later in the week because that first

852
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:37,560
time getting in can often be the hardest

853
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,730
and once you know the building just keep

854
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,230
looking out for ways that you're gonna

855
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,060
get in on Tuesday and through the rest

856
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:43,500
of the week

857
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:45,330
signing in and friends as a visitor so

858
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,100
if you can get one guy in and the other

859
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:50,009
guys still stood in the coffee shop you

860
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:51,960
can just walk to the barrier and just

861
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:53,490
say hey Steve yeah come on in yeah oh

862
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,690
yeah yeah can we get this guy in the

863
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:58,859
rest of it maybe he's carrying something

864
00:35:54,690 --> 00:36:02,850
and we just get him in that way this is

865
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:04,320
a video another funny story there was no

866
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:06,839
one in reception and we'd been in this

867
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,660
building until about half 10:00 at night

868
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:11,460
just taking out open computer so

869
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,020
obviously everyone's laptops encrypted

870
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,120
so we stayed in the office till out of

871
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:18,390
hours desktops on traditionally

872
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:20,310
encrypted so we just took our time hang

873
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:22,589
around the office till they people start

874
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:24,299
going home 9 10 and at 10 we know

875
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:26,100
there's no one left so we just start

876
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,350
going through the floor and just taking

877
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,970
desktops apart plug the desktop hard

878
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:33,240
drive in your computer and start getting

879
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:34,799
hashes off the computer that way before

880
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,250
we left the building I was like I'll

881
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:42,510
just get some passes so I'm scoping out

882
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:44,820
the reception and little did I know it

883
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:47,880
on the other side of the glass there's

884
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:50,070
the night security just smoking watching

885
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,930
me through the glass and I can't see her

886
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,670
and she's just there like just smoking

887
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:55,560
watching I don't know where she was

888
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,660
stood anyway she comes bawling in like

889
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,980

00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:12,240
keep your eyes peeled because this girl

895
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:15,180
left her pass in the food hop-up machine

896
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,240
again thanks very much helps us out for

897
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:21,419
the rest of the week so once we've got

898
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,120
network access secured it's up to us

899
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:28,380
then go and do the techie pit the

900
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:31,020
traditional pentesting and start you

901
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:33,330
know running necess and you know what as

902
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:35,850
pen testers do run their cisco cup of

903
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:37,319
tea now what's actually going on there's

904
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:38,819
a lot hard work trying to find

905
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,500
vulnerabilities on the enterprise

906
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,450
network we're scanning brain mapping

907
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,280
we're trying to find those services

908
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:47,220
again same approach we're looking

909
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,660
for those really high impact high risk

910
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,279
vulnerabilities that are going to get as

911
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,140
into a server and then we can start to

912
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,450
escalate privileges throughout and we

913
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:56,310
want to prove further persistence so we

914
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:58,140
want to take control of that domain and

915
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:00,660
stay there as long as we can we want to

916
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,580
be able to leave and prove that we got

917
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,000
in got some data and we got some access

918
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:07,230
as well that we could take with us and

919
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,080
make sure you get the evidence so that's

920
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:11,820
me and Danny up there with two big

921
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:19,230
smiles on in an office that we shouldn't

922
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:24,110
be in so that was me any questions we've

923
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:24,110
got time for questions questions okay
