1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:09,559
so thank you for everyone attending the

2
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:12,018
talk this was originally going to be a

3
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,959
beer farmers talk but they all had jobs

4
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:18,590
or something so unfortunately couldn't

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,680
make it so I will be standing in instead

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:24,910
of them so just quick bit about myself I

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,520
do stuff at a company security stuff

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:31,640
co-leader of our Scotland chapter we

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,469
have farmers remember so in a way you

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,140
are listening to a beer farmers talk

11
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:39,500
just not the one that we were planning

12
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:44,120
I'm really active on Twitter and I just

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:47,329
do security stuff so the purpose of this

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:52,070
talk is to go over to have not aware of

15
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:54,340
anything else been cordless but I came

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:58,370
up with the idea of security enablement

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:01,670
after being look frustrated like that

18
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,919
guy finding that going off two teams

19
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,020
asking him to fix the same things over

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,670
and over given a bit of friction and

21
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:12,679
asking for bugs to be fixed not getting

22
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,520
security reviews died and so on so forth

23
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:20,180
and it became apparent to me that we

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:23,000
have to change things constantly trying

25
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:26,630
to do that the shayateens golden and

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,600
that is it's just not working so I tried

27
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:32,089
you a more encouraging positive way of

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,589
doing it so the concept itself security

29
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:38,570
enablement I kind of derive from the

30
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:44,350
squad top model anyone here familiar

31
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:48,439
with squad top okay so squad is a

32
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:51,619
development app concept where teams are

33
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:53,869
broken up into isolated teams that are

34
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:57,140
self functioning so they all do things

35
00:01:53,869 --> 00:02:00,650
from development on systems that the

36
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:03,380
iron testing deployments troubleshooting

37
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,330
so you no longer have separate teams for

38
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,640
development testing it's a team

39
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,949
responsible for service so the idea

40
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,919
behind that they own that system they

41
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:14,450
can hopefully get things out quicker

42
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,600
this obviously means you get some

43
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,750
degrees of us

44
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,769
Latian you might have different systems

45
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:25,800
that share common components so you kind

46
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:29,730
of form squads to join up and form

47
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,710
things termed as tribes and guilt they

48
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:36,510
kind of work together to form performing

49
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:39,510
a single task it's what if I have a

50
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,250
really good resource on this so if

51
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,190
you're interested recommend go reading

52
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,340
up on there but the big thing around

53
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,810
squads

54
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:52,080
is having the cross team collaboration

55
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:55,050
to achieve the goal so my idea is take

56
00:02:52,080 --> 00:03:00,060
that sort of concept and power the

57
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:03,390
security aspect to it well going down

58
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,280
this road I think it's important that we

59
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,350
have a look at ourselves and see how we

60
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,710
are perceived to others because

61
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:13,019
perception often indicates how teams are

62
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,650
gonna interact with you how they're

63
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,570
gonna react to what you say to them and

64
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:21,330
when taking a step back and seeing what

65
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:27,000
other safe wins and our teams think of

66
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:29,160
Martine well some of that's online there

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,610
so these are just pictures I found

68
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,270
online and security engineers so I'm a

69
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:39,090
security engineer my partner does think

70
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:43,380
tsardom backside all day staring at the

71
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:47,940
monitor doing nothing and yes I actually

72
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:50,519
normally do shots at the computer but as

73
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,590
I said it's important to see what teams

74
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,890
think of you and if you take a step back

75
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,920
and see what we actually do especially

76
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:02,670
what I used to do in my team was scored

77
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:06,299
a lot tell people what to do what not to

78
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,459
do as well as seen as a roadblock no you

79
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,800
can't release this because it hasn't had

80
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,740
a security scan have you done this have

81
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,510
you done that so it's a hindrance to

82
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:19,940
them delivering what they actually

83
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,940
trying to get out into production so

84
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,560
taking a step

85
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,949
I think it's time that we change from

86
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,949
being the perception of the policing the

87
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:34,710
the ones that are constantly watching

88
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:36,870
other teams trying to find faults with

89
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,448
them trying to prevent them from doing

90
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:42,300
things basically at times prevent them

91
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:47,430
from doing their jobs and turns it into

92
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:49,770
a concept of where we teach teams let's

93
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,750
teach them how to do things let's teach

94
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,030
them how to do the basic things so we

95
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,719
don't have to keep up with doing the the

96
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:59,669
constants trivial things

97
00:04:56,719 --> 00:05:01,830
let's get better interaction with the

98
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:04,378
teams so then when things do go wrong

99
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:08,909
they can hopefully come to us and not be

100
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:11,669
afraid and this is really important

101
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:15,990
because if you take a step back and see

102
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:19,919
where development yeasty la or in fact

103
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:23,099
most processes and companies it was very

104
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:26,938
monolithic I like to you think of this

105
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:30,210
as an analogy to development when you do

106
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:32,669
a back in the day feature release you

107
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,940
had lots of changes all grouped together

108
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:38,190
and put out in one big change quarterly

109
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,159
release annual release by might be

110
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,930
released and that was great that was a

111
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:44,879
lot easier from a security point of view

112
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,860
you could as you know when the release

113
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,900
was happening you sure it would take a

114
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,550
while to do the security test and review

115
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,469
but you could plan for it you could

116
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,389
allocate resources to it you knew what

117
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:56,270
was coming

118
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:59,039
whereas if you changed you today

119
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,770
releases or something like this they

120
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,050
come in all shapes and sizes and they

121
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,560
it's a now just a constant flow there's

122
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:10,199
no notion of hey we're going to do a

123
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:13,589
quarterly release most many companies

124
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:16,250
that are especially that the newer ones

125
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:19,949
that are following modern development

126
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:22,080
methodologies are following the CR C D

127
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:23,610
so for those who don't know CR C D is

128
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,620
continuous integration continuous

129
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:29,279
delivery basically developed test passes

130
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,669
the test

131
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,620
push into production and that means you

132
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:36,599
end up with the releases happening on a

133
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,610
continual basis sometimes maybe even a

134
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:40,878
daily base

135
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:43,379
so that means you can no longer plan

136
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,819
allocate resources because it's

137
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:48,659
something that's just continuously

138
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:50,279
happening so that's definitely not going

139
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:53,310
to scale well because as we all know

140
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:56,279
security teams don't scale up as a

141
00:06:53,310 --> 00:07:00,479
business growth and we already we are

142
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:03,090
under-resourced as is so this is where

143
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,120
this whole concept comes from and before

144
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,770
going down this path the very first

145
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,069
thing you need to do is make sure you

146
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:14,299
get buy-in from management's this is

147
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:16,860
going to help to make sure that you get

148
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,169
the support that you need from the top

149
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,729
level that you're going to get the

150
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:23,068
perception that this is something really

151
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:25,949
important think about if the CEO is

152
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:28,439
talking about security it must be really

153
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:31,349
important versus some engineering

154
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,879
manager down at the the lower rung not

155
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:36,210
to say that what the same is not

156
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,860
important but just the perception coming

157
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,688
from the further up the trains better

158
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,719
and also if you're going to start

159
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:45,089
implementing features asking for budgets

160
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:47,759
so on so forth you're going to have a

161
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,919
much better time if you get the buy-in

162
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,189
from those who actually make those kind

163
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,378
of decisions and while doing this make

164
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:57,240
sure you're on the same page so make

165
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:59,789
sure the management understands that

166
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,729
what you're trying to achieve why are

167
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:05,729
you trying to achieve it and at the same

168
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:07,589
time that you work with management to

169
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:09,870
understand that you're going to help

170
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:12,629
support the business because the last

171
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:17,310
thing management want to do is have some

172
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:20,460
sort of feature or process that's going

173
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:24,330
to hinder business and negatively impact

174
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:26,549
on the business so once you've got

175
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,620
buy-in from management then it can kind

176
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:36,870
of start on the path and the very first

177
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:38,459
thing I'd say is awareness sorry so for

178
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,269
me awareness is really something

179
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,869
important when I did my university

180
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:45,360
degree

181
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,640
I sort of as a developer are there four

182
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,370
years of university not once to hear

183
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,090
sequel injection cross-site scripting

184
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:54,510
any other common

185
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:57,630
horn abilities I went straight into a

186
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:59,760
job now as a fair to assume that I

187
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,470
should have been able to code and

188
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,779
prevent cross-site scripting or sequel

189
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,890
injection how could I prevent it if I

190
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,870
don't even know about it

191
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:09,000
so we have to create awareness around

192
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,100
these issues it's not saying that then

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,770
people will fix them but at least they

194
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:17,130
know it exists they have to be aware of

195
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:19,829
it and hopefully by making them aware of

196
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:22,710
it and this is where I always prefer

197
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:24,960
using real-world examples so for example

198
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:27,270
across our script team don't just show

199
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,630
alert box show you something like a be

200
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:33,360
fog across that scripting inject the

201
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:36,750
beef hook users browsers compromised

202
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,040
that Satyam brings the awareness to the

203
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,410
user that cross-site scripting is

204
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,140
actually something that's really

205
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:47,360
dangerous and you need to be aware of

206
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:50,910
alert box nothing really

207
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:54,230
so and taking that a step further and

208
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:56,850
saying here's some real-world examples

209
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:59,070
where it's actually resulted in an issue

210
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:02,250
or compromise for a company just further

211
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:04,650
drives that message home and then

212
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:10,020
there's some common tools that you can

213
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:11,670
use to help so I always top 10 think

214
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:15,230
everyone and almost people in the room

215
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:19,140
will know that what that is and it's

216
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:22,740
used in many tools reports and that's

217
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:25,439
it's something that's updated quite

218
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:28,350
regularly but to our phones but every

219
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,880
few years and to me that's a really

220
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,190
useful tool because it keeps up to date

221
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,870
with the current common vulnerabilities

222
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:39,270
that you can find out there so again

223
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:41,330
emphasizing these are the issues you

224
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,709
need to watch out for to those

225
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:47,310
developing a systems testing systems

226
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:50,099
deploying new systems science 25 has

227
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:52,140
something similar and then cwe arm is

228
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,010
going a little a little bit lower but it

229
00:10:52,140 --> 00:11:00,330
helps you classify different

230
00:10:53,010 --> 00:11:01,459
vulnerabilities based on their tops so

231
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,860
while

232
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:07,779
another really useful tool for awareness

233
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:14,330
the CTS it adds some sort of fun

234
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:17,779
gamification to awareness and also helps

235
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:21,920
from your security team so I'm horrible

236
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:23,839
at CTS I won't lie but I did my first

237
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,610
one last year and I've always been a bit

238
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,000
too afraid of doing them because I

239
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:33,200
suspect I was horrible at them and I

240
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,870
confirmed that but what it does what the

241
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,420
one thing they taught me is you get so

242
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,880
fixated in your own little bubble that

243
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:45,529
you work day in day out doing CTS make

244
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:48,740
you aware of a lot wider issues to look

245
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:49,339
out for so I'm pretty much focused on

246
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,640
whereabouts

247
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:57,050
I don't do anything matter and network

248
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,970
security in that CTF change that so it's

249
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,859
just making a way of the different

250
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:04,490
scopes and getting other people involved

251
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:07,520
in that just going to help from that

252
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,910
aspect and then also having simple CTS

253
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:14,420
so again from awareness point of view

254
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:16,370
having some competition and I think of

255
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:19,520
most people would agree development

256
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:21,140
teams QA teams basically I feel like are

257
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,770
competitive when I get in a team

258
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,990
environment

259
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:27,949
so putting a team against the key team

260
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:30,920
and some fun maybe you my name formal

261
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:32,870
CTF competition is a great way to raise

262
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:37,729
awareness and have some fun while doing

263
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:40,399
it brown bags are another great one that

264
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:43,820
can literally cost nothing to set up a

265
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,220
few PowerPoint slides presented over

266
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,399
some lunch

267
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:51,410
tom session especially if you've got

268
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,899
some desktop sharing they are web cross

269
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:57,430
tools out there and it's a great way of

270
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:57,430
sharing information with your teams

271
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:03,260
while talking about training the the

272
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:08,029
important thing is don't make it man

273
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:10,160
Rafi I find that as soon as you make

274
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:13,730
mandatory it becomes a checkbox exercise

275
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,010
and you got to remember teams are have

276
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,800
they

277
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:19,080
priorities under pressure to deliver so

278
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,400
what they're going to do are going to

279
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,290
finish this I'll leave it to the last

280
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,550
minute I got to finish about this date

281
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:26,640
click-click click-click click-click

282
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:29,280
they've not absorbed anything and you've

283
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,980
actually solved nothing rather make it

284
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:35,569
easy for them to access it when they

285
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:40,370
want to and make it relevant

286
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:45,270
why should a web developer take some

287
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:51,030
mandatory training around and I say for

288
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:54,270
instance always always Intel if they're

289
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:57,630
just developing on web applications is

290
00:13:54,270 --> 00:14:01,439
there going to help them so make it

291
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:04,290
relevant and also make it self reference

292
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,660
so they can come back to it how do you

293
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,219
prevent cross-site scripting okay well

294
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,589
I'll just go to this page and look it up

295
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:14,100
and make it simple to digest so I'm a

296
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:17,280
really big fan of tables have a so for

297
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,510
example security headers have a table

298
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,860
these aren't your mandatory security

299
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,650
headers which you should always have

300
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:25,290
these are the defaults and then if the

301
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:26,670
ones you have more information links

302
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:28,770
that they control down and get further

303
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:31,650
information at the dev I can see

304
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:34,620
straight away go to the page okay

305
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:38,160
there's these tables copy them put them

306
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:42,440
in it's taken me five minutes versus

307
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,439
falling through rounds of documentation

308
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:50,670
so as I mentioned before security teams

309
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:53,010
are often facing challenges with

310
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:57,689
resourcing so one way to combat that is

311
00:14:53,010 --> 00:15:00,450
with security champions security

312
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:02,790
champions will be people that you should

313
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:04,350
have volunteer the last thing you want

314
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,900
to do is try and force this on someone

315
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:09,240
because they'll likely be resistant to

316
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,640
it get people to volunteer to this

317
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,260
because a they'll be interested in

318
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,990
security otherwise while they're

319
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,300
volunteering and B they'll actually want

320
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:22,560
to make a change so that's really

321
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,520
important and they're gonna help because

322
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,930
they're gonna act as the middleman

323
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,230
between security team and the

324
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:31,819
development teams and QA teams and

325
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:33,740
the pointman teams so take for example a

326
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,580
team we're working on some company

327
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:40,160
portal and a security team there's gonna

328
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,320
be a disconnect their security team is

329
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,640
going to be focused on purely security

330
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:49,400
related concepts that development team

331
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,530
is going to be focus on the webapp

332
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,720
side of things there may be new

333
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,670
technologies that the security teams not

334
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,800
even aware of or there may be issues

335
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:00,560
that the dev team is not even a way of

336
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,660
having that middleman they'll kind of

337
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,630
bridge that gap a bit and also be aware

338
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:08,150
more aware of what kind of priority lie

339
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,880
in that development teams pipelines or

340
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:13,880
what needs to come what new features are

341
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,850
being developed and that can help plan

342
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,740
as well as say hey this should get a

343
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,290
security review or and then your

344
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,060
penthouse or whatever so you get better

345
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:27,050
visibility into what the teams are doing

346
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:29,989
as well and as I said security teams are

347
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:32,479
under-resourced so it helps reduce the

348
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:36,260
burden these security champions can take

349
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:40,160
on some of the more trivial top security

350
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,810
things so if you have a scanner maybe

351
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,020
they can take ownership of scanning in

352
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:47,000
their weather means that now that dev

353
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,980
team can scan their web app when they

354
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,490
want to and it reduces the burden on

355
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,770
your team having to do that and as I

356
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,620
said it will help identify issues you

357
00:16:54,770 --> 00:17:00,530
know so you know the whole shift left

358
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:02,450
well having that the source means that

359
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:04,579
they can potentially want to be always

360
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:08,660
that could potentially help identify

361
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:11,599
issues sooner and one way to try get

362
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,459
people actively encouraged is some of

363
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:17,030
the points on yeah so it's going to look

364
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:18,440
good in their CV Security's not going

365
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,300
away security is only growing in

366
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,670
problems so anything that you can

367
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:28,099
include in the CV basin Security's a

368
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:29,600
plus you can solve ten in conferences

369
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:34,370
maybe depending on the company and

370
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:36,919
budgets and they're going to possibly

371
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,570
affect some fine things sooner so from

372
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,850
that team point of view it means less

373
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:45,020
issues to fix less

374
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:52,189
possible blockage for releases so it's a

375
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:53,799
win-win for both teams so on top of

376
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,660
[Music]

377
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:58,070
security champions you have the tools

378
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:01,850
now tools are going to be really

379
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:03,500
important as I mentioned before things

380
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,570
that can happen in a lot faster and one

381
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,140
way to do that is reduce the burden on

382
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,850
yourselves

383
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,220
the manual work that you have to do

384
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:15,379
especially for the more trivial things

385
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:18,679
so static analysis tools that will scan

386
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:20,929
the source code there's many options out

387
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:24,890
there I'm not going to met in mention

388
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:28,730
names but feel free to ask me afterwards

389
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:30,320
or look online but those are going to

390
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,390
look at the actual source code itself

391
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,158
and find common vulnerabilities in the

392
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,289
source code so that could be things like

393
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:39,470
hard code passwords weak encryption

394
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:41,289
algorithms or even finally in the kind

395
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:45,679
of logic of the source code at some

396
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:48,080
points so for example a method or

397
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,880
function that takes in a parameter and

398
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:56,360
the seasons not escaping that request

399
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:59,590
the parameters of the request the next

400
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:02,120
one there's dynamic analysis tools so

401
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:05,149
these are kind of think of your more

402
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:07,699
pentesting tap tools or sorry automate

403
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:10,100
the pen testing in the sense so these

404
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:13,760
are going to be typically your web apps

405
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:16,789
scanners that are going to try attempt

406
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,580
to do common probes against your system

407
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:21,669
so testing things for like example

408
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:25,270
cross-site scripting sequel injection

409
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:28,100
finding information about the web app so

410
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:31,580
what cipher Suites the web app supports

411
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:34,789
I knew of those weak again things like

412
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:36,350
this will take you hours to do these

413
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:38,990
tools well let's really take you minutes

414
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:42,049
some some of them will take hours but

415
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:44,090
some of them will just take minutes the

416
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:48,320
next one is a really big one in my

417
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:51,590
opinion and we're starting to see a rise

418
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,950
of this is libraries in dependency

419
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,949
management

420
00:19:54,620 --> 00:20:00,260
especially around injecting potential

421
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:04,820
malicious code into those libraries it

422
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:07,309
has happened and the way I look at it if

423
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,750
I'm attacker why should I go through the

424
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:11,120
hard work of trying to break through the

425
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:13,220
front door the back door when I can get

426
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:17,689
through but out by the front door with

427
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:20,510
her library as well as libraries are

428
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:23,360
horrendous in terms of maintaining I've

429
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:25,280
done it the pendency hell this library

430
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,439
depends on this library that depends on

431
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,540
that library they didn't update the

432
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,809
library has a vulnerability it doesn't

433
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,510
get updated so from a managing point of

434
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:37,160
view you need to know what risk you have

435
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:39,830
when you have libraries so there are

436
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,510
tools out there that do a great job OS

437
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,800
this pendency track is probably the only

438
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:46,640
tool I'm going to mention because it's

439
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,919
free it does a fantastic job will tell

440
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,870
you what libraries are you using and

441
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,110
what all those are actually have known

442
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:59,530
vulnerabilities and if you don't believe

443
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:59,530
me ask Equifax how this impacted them

444
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:04,250
kind of related to the next one so a

445
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:06,610
certain vulnerability scanning again

446
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:09,260
asset management is something that I

447
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,639
don't think a single company does really

448
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:13,760
well

449
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:17,360
time and time again we seen open MongoDB

450
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:21,490
es open elastics databases and that's

451
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,490
because you have poor asset management

452
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:27,350
with for scanning around those assets

453
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,179
and detecting them as well as the

454
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,370
vulnerabilities so vulnerabilities in

455
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:36,650
terms of always label packages software

456
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:38,419
that kind of thing so quickly going over

457
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:42,770
tools when you when you select a tool

458
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:45,590
ask ask around ask the community you

459
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:47,030
don't have to do double the work if

460
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:49,189
someone's already gone through the

461
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:52,100
process of trying to vet tools get the

462
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:54,230
input them and also find the issues that

463
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,850
they find was some tool that you're

464
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:59,120
looking at that might not work for you

465
00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:00,919
or whatever and also a big one

466
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,290
open-source now don't get me wrong I'm a

467
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,940
big fan of open source but there's often

468
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:08,450
a misconception open source is always

469
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:10,340
free yes the product might be free

470
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,769
you might invest a significant portion

471
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,759
and resources and trying to maintain it

472
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:21,769
keep it up to date

473
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:25,460
like for example Apache the the graph

474
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:28,789
for Apache alright it's gorgeous

475
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:31,519
but trying to maintain that yourself is

476
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:33,549
difficult you're gonna have a lot of

477
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:36,590
time and resources there's an

478
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:39,859
maintaining that much much security

479
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:42,289
thank you their companies are there each

480
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:43,779
she can give a monthly fee and get their

481
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:46,669
products and their maintainer for you

482
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:49,279
whether that will be beneficial for you

483
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:54,019
I don't know but that's that's one thing

484
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:56,570
that you need to consider and as we grow

485
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:57,409
more and more in terms of delivering

486
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,080
faster and faster

487
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:01,580
automation is going to be key devices

488
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,158
are exploiting the number of systems

489
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:08,178
that we have in exploiting do not have

490
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:11,029
things like elastic systems where VM

491
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:14,059
spin up and spin down trying to keep

492
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:14,989
track of that from a manual process it's

493
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,730
not going to work so you're gonna need

494
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:19,399
some more automation than to that and

495
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:23,809
where you can embed it in the SDLC

496
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:26,268
process see our CD is kind of enforces

497
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:29,389
us so it's going to be a click of a

498
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:31,100
button or when I click the button how do

499
00:23:29,389 --> 00:23:33,408
I make sure what's going out is going to

500
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,178
be secure I can't expect every time I

501
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:37,190
click the button someone to validate

502
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:41,119
that can you need some places to do that

503
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:44,749
and in my opinion this is the biggest

504
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:46,279
one for security automate at least the

505
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:53,600
the more trivial things as much as

506
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:55,309
possible quick one security issues make

507
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,350
sure you have a process for triage in

508
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:59,359
security issues as well as prioritizing

509
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:02,209
them some companies I've seen have no

510
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:04,820
process and by this I mean you need to

511
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:07,879
separate your typical bugs from your

512
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:10,879
actually real sorry from your security

513
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:12,619
bugs the demand they can use the same

514
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:14,779
tool but make sure you have a process of

515
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:17,809
being able to identify the risk that

516
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:20,929
each security bug poses and be able to

517
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:21,920
triage that it's also going to help in

518
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:24,680
terms of tracking which

519
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:27,290
teens might need help so hey this team

520
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,870
has created 10 blocker bugs in the last

521
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:31,909
month but whereas no other team has well

522
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:34,550
that teams obviously a problem not to

523
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:36,110
point fingers but to identifiable

524
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:41,050
there's a team need extra training

525
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:41,050
Gardens is there something else missing

526
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:52,460
so it kind of touches on the choice of

527
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:55,580
tools look to your others I encouraged

528
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:58,550
using things like Twitter I used I

529
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:03,260
started Twitter about two years ago in

530
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:05,870
that time I've learned a huge amount

531
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:10,060
more than I've learnt and probably all

532
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:10,060
my years and security outside of Twitter

533
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:17,530
and you network with people you can

534
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:21,320
bounce ideas of people you can get

535
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:25,670
advice supports all that's really

536
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:27,860
important and also at the top there it

537
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:29,030
also avoid you repeating some of the

538
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,740
same mistakes that were made before

539
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:35,060
avoid duplicate efforts there must have

540
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:38,570
resources that they can share with you

541
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:39,980
open source open source documentation or

542
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,840
might even know some tools that might

543
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,290
help that you might I don't know will

544
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,760
develop up from the ground out and the

545
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:49,850
other important one is avoid the same

546
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:52,160
mistakes so in security you always want

547
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:55,010
to try to avoid mistakes because that's

548
00:25:52,160 --> 00:26:01,700
not a security issues so if you can

549
00:25:55,010 --> 00:26:05,150
avoid those great and then some other

550
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:08,120
just quicker bus accept failures we all

551
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:09,920
human except that you're not going to

552
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,989
solve every security bug will get every

553
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,120
security bug personally I find this

554
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:15,910
really hard I'm a perfectionist I'll see

555
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,879
a security bug I want it resolved now

556
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:21,140
but I need to realize that we're not

557
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,790
going to solve them all so that's why

558
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,020
you prior to us make sure you fix the

559
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:26,330
ones that are going to represent the

560
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,710
most risk and at the end of the security

561
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,270
is about managing risk

562
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:30,590
you're not going to eliminate it you

563
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:33,410
just try to reduce it as much as

564
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:35,120
possible and that kind of leads down to

565
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:37,120
the be patient part so sometimes

566
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,530
marquita bug fixed as soon as you went

567
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,409
work with the team target effects as

568
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:47,149
soon as possible but be patient help

569
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:54,530
them as I said ask for help and engage

570
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:57,770
with the community so some up at the end

571
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:59,420
of the day we all when we work for

572
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:01,670
companies we're all trying to see

573
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:05,030
achieve the same goal as a development

574
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:07,610
team or QA team finance team HR team

575
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:09,889
doesn't matter work team we work there

576
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:14,600
to help the companies or services or

577
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:16,910
products to make a profit or provide

578
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:21,050
services if your nonprofit organization

579
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:22,670
or help but the point is you're trying

580
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:26,750
to work to achieve the same thing at the

581
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:28,850
end of the day and that makes you all

582
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:33,470
part of the same team so should work

583
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:36,520
together and there are ways to change

584
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:39,140
the perception of securities a roadblock

585
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:42,170
something of a hindrance and can

586
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:44,870
actually help I've done some things in

587
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:48,559
the past that actually improved the

588
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:51,409
process that the way people went about

589
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,750
things and that helped security as well

590
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:55,040
as the process and that's a huge one is

591
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,840
it gonna get people more engaged and

592
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:01,570
their change slowly changes their

593
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:06,050
perception and at the end of the day

594
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:09,110
sorry that also one way to get people to

595
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:13,360
help the security engage in security

596
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:15,979
more is making least effort as possible

597
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,379
requires little knowledge as possible I

598
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,960
provide the knowledge but also least

599
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,870
effort saving if something can require

600
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,730
one line as opposed to them spending

601
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:27,469
hours on the internet great that's going

602
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:30,950
to be a huge one so for example I've

603
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:33,440
developed a TLS library for developers

604
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:35,030
to use for systems they don't have to

605
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,420
have any knowledge of what South Suites

606
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:40,760
a week and why or even which ones to

607
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:43,910
support that they are one line and in

608
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,410
their code and they know the grades it's

609
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:47,480
going to be really hard for them to

610
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:48,890
argue against that it's going to be easy

611
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,170
for them to implement

612
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:54,950
and everyone wins and that kind of

613
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:57,680
builds on truffle security culture where

614
00:28:54,950 --> 00:29:01,040
teams start thinking of security has

615
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:03,410
been their problem as well or getting

616
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,060
them and their peers to call out those

617
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:09,610
who aren't doing security as opposed to

618
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:09,610
you and that drive that security culture

619
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:29,920
so questions so you certainly have a

620
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:33,250
disclosure program some means of

621
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:36,830
allowing people to disclose a

622
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:40,520
vulnerability or funny so yeah and then

623
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:42,980
make it transparent so work with your

624
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,050
dev teams give in regular updates to

625
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:47,720
that person who found it and give it I

626
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:52,149
know a lot of people expecting money and

627
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,150
gifts on that but but simple thank you

628
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,350
so at the end of the day seesaw is going

629
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:16,330
to be responsible for the security it's

630
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:16,330
in their best interest that security is

631
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:23,240
improves where possible so trying to get

632
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:27,919
there by and from from that is going to

633
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:31,430
help them in the long run right so if

634
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,320
getting the seesaw on board getting the

635
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:37,910
seaso to work with the engineering or

636
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:41,090
development manager or head formed

637
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:58,220
none of these pads that will help

638
00:30:41,090 --> 00:31:05,250
hopefully drive it so yep at the back so

639
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:08,610
good question um there is a SVS it's not

640
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:11,520
quite a security development thing it's

641
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:13,320
more yeah it's more testing framework

642
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,800
but you could kind of leverage that to

643
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:18,090
help aid in security development I'm not

644
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,560
aware of anything outside of the

645
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:22,260
Microsoft the other problem is things

646
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:24,990
are changing so fast so what might be

647
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,870
there one day can change three four

648
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:30,660
years down the line so it's difficult

649
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:33,540
and every company changes their

650
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:35,670
perceptions Lackey so it goes speak to a

651
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:38,700
company hate what's agile to you you

652
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:45,680
might get two different answers from

653
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:45,680
different companies any other questions

654
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:08,910
so there are times where companies

655
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:11,340
cannot change because of legacy reasons

656
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:13,770
and whatever but certainly they could

657
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:18,449
probably try to adapt more modern

658
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:21,090
methodologies and concepts try to take

659
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:23,370
use case like comes to the point where I

660
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,899
say take real-world examples that's

661
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:27,780
always a great way to trust all

662
