1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,590
see I'm Chris I look at malware that

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,840
kind of stuff I'm also a developer on

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,960
threat crowd a threat into a platform

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,410
and open for exchange is the mic okay

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,420
isn't it oh thank you oh yeah I could

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,199
reject my voice

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,019
everyone's venting Crescent about those

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,970
actions usually hit me up I'm gonna talk

9
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:27,089
about Crickley jacking mostly with a

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,249
cloudy kind of angle I'm not sure if

11
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:32,399
everyone knows what crypto Jeff King is

12
00:00:29,249 --> 00:00:35,010
I practiced this talk to my girlfriend

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,250
last night and I know we have a great

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,449
great great Thursday nights

15
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,859
she was laughing every time I said the

16
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:43,289
word click the Jackie so probably should

17
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:46,559
explain it to give me a hand signal

18
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:48,420
display unless you've got a mentor me so

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,250
if you made cryptocurrencies things like

20
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,050
Bitcoin I was the most famous fun part

21
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,390
that key thing about cryptocurrencies is

22
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,038
that army have to mine that currency so

23
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,230
basically kind of making value yourself

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,579
using your piece of resources you're

25
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:04,378
solving basically complex equations

26
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:05,820
yeah assets here we are crypto jacking

27
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,100
is when you're doing it without someone

28
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,229
else mission so rather than paying for

29
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,850
own computing power rather than after

30
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,740
run your own like Bitcoin mine or the

31
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,030
power station somewhere you can pack

32
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,479
into a bunch of those computers and you

33
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,150
can make quality that way and if anyone

34
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,460
has any questions by the way just shout

35
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,900
them out or hand uncle throw something

36
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,860
happy that's fine too so yeah obviously

37
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,530
cryptocurrencies have a pretty crazy

38
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,200
year in terms of pricing a couple years

39
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,390
so back in 2017 there's a big Street up

40
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,670
where you're seeing like I'm public

41
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,470
transport adverts Jeter and bet your

42
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,080
pension Bitcoin that kind of thing Lance

43
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,660
we know there's a robust about to happen

44
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,340
maybe there's some good news there too

45
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,860
though because there's a direct

46
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,810
correlation between how much malware and

47
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,330
to general attacks you targeting the

48
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,160
currency and the price of it so when we

49
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,860
saw Bitcoin and we narrow in other

50
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,450
currencies shooting up in 2017 you see a

51
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,700
lot less ransomware targeting people

52
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,690
because the attackers are switching out

53
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,130
for the miners

54
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,929
they're making more long-term gains that

55
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,490
way sound leaving the prices go down

56
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,180
you suppose so you know some fun friends

57
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,830
don't look very clearly kind of

58
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,690
quantifying the potential of damage or

59
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,300
how much money people are making the

60
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,700
best attempt of

61
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:22,600
scenes by Palo Alto released a blog last

62
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,609
year just to explain that to the top

63
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,870
that's the Monaro bottom ID and that's

64
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,530
how much money that particular attack

65
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:31,420
has made so with Bitcoin there there's a

66
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,940
public ledger so you can see how much

67
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,079
everyone's personal while ID has so you

68
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,050
know some people have millions they're

69
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,490
from legitimate mining with Manero if

70
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,290
it's more tricky it's an anonymous

71
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,310
currency so you can't just go and see

72
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,590
someone's wallet and see how much money

73
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,360
they've made there are public mining

74
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,850
pools which is where most this mine goes

75
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,950
through all their resources to get more

76
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,540
kind of stable earning from my name

77
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,910
between go there and basically get the

78
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,290
same curve either out so Palo Alto they

79
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,829
ripped out a bunch of other IDs and

80
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:01,570
malware and this is what they saw bit of

81
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,030
caveat here those that top one where

82
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:08,320
they made what at that time 15 million

83
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,670
dollars worth of in dollars I looked

84
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,130
about and I've let me find one sample

85
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,230
for that tip that wall IDs so basically

86
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,269
that means there are maybe that was like

87
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,399
a legitimate miner sauce a little bit of

88
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,080
malware as well or maybe there's a bunch

89
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,110
of mining going on I can't see my

90
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,550
telemetry that many infections anyway

91
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,860
basically some people making a lot of

92
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,190
money that's a Tod on their estimate was

93
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,270
that about five percent plus of monaro

94
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,970
there's been mined out there although

95
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:36,730
five summers coins have been mined

96
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,050
illegal even greater jacking so manera

97
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,820
has a marker camp up a bit over a

98
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,290
billion pounds so you know at least like

99
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,180
50 million pounds worth probably has

100
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:47,560
been mined it was machines part that

101
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:49,090
mission see ya copper color more

102
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,980
interesting crypto jacking stories

103
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,690
Norway Singh this is delivered through

104
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,970
like an email or a cast down now my

105
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,470
stuff is a bit more interesting so the

106
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,660
website could coin hive

107
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,850
if you guys are familiar with coin hive

108
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,310
but they had quite a nice idea they

109
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,530
needed help arms funded favorite

110
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,300
websites by letting the mines in manera

111
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,340
in your browser so if you went to the

112
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,840
Pirate Bay's website it'd be mining in

113
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,760
the background white on the website and

114
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,680
making them bit of cash but obviously

115
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,450
quite quickly back I started using it

116
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,250
one the tricks they're doing was they're

117
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,979
compromising people's home Wi-Fi routers

118
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,620
and they're injecting it so that every

119
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,150
single website that person visits has

120
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,430
point I've added to it so

121
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,289
this is a internet scams and binary

122
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,090
addresses that let's show them I can see

123
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,600
there are 50,000 compromised roses right

124
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,859
now I haven't even told these people yet

125
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,330
but every single website a visit is

126
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,560
super slow and they probably wondering

127
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,609
why that there you go

128
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,430
another very interesting trend we're

129
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:49,370
seeing how important so much is the rise

130
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,310
of crypto mining worms so this is one I

131
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,570
looked at a while ago with a math minor

132
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,550
because it was scanning the entire

133
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,530
internet using something called maths

134
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,500
can they see break laws and map to find

135
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,299
more victims Scout to the network to the

136
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,889
way they spreads to other networks has

137
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,750
got a bunch of different exploits built

138
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:07,789
in so if you're running oracle weblogic

139
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,400
snow the alert logic guys talking about

140
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:12,139
earlier that's a lot of security issues

141
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,789
so we'll get in through some of the

142
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:15,830
exploits there's one in the world right

143
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:16,789
now but alone there isn't detection for

144
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,039
yet

145
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:23,300
maternal blue obviously a rather famous

146
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,349
exploit fairer window doesn't be secret

147
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,000
brute force so if you're running

148
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:27,800
Microsoft sequel as guests as a bunch of

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,419
passwords if you're running a honeypot

150
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,949
you'll be seen this stuff hitting you

151
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:32,659
all the time it sounds spreading around

152
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:35,120
the internet and these guys are making

153
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,830
they are reading that money like a few

154
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,110
tens of thousands of dollars that make

155
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,570
you permission the guy that Cisco

156
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,340
identified something behind not bit as a

157
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,380
campaign but very closely related one

158
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,810
and it looks I was a kid at university

159
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,550
outside Shanghai so it's some like

160
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,889
underground he's driving a Porsche

161
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:56,060
around so yeah good money you know I

162
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:58,460
think it also stores it backdoor disable

163
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,750
security too so the problem is that once

164
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,159
they've infected you someone else can

165
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,479
come and take all your business data so

166
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:04,039
they're not just mining malware and you

167
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,930
have like a super slow database to your

168
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:08,510
business they turn on your five or they

169
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,310
turn off your antivirus they change the

170
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:13,490
missions that we file the destitute so

171
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:17,539
there's a yeah the next people can get

172
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,949
at it easier as well so this the first

173
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:20,930
thought like a pretty boring piece of

174
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:23,419
crypto mining Marse taking a look at you

175
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,639
can see there it copies itself to the

176
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:27,710
windows folder then runs it from there

177
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,530
I stopped nets are very easy to figure

178
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,000
decompile I don't want to guess what's

179
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:36,619
kind of interesting about this piece of

180
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,870
map with though see in the code the the

181
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,930
TOB of the domain there is KP

182
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:44,300
so this was going off to a monaro pool

183
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,760
server at University in Pyongyang North

184
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,349
Korean and this is pretty interesting

185
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,270
because I'm university known to be

186
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:52,550
linked one paint a couple attacks and

187
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,740
also they're investing in trip their

188
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,020
mind because if you're in a concert with

189
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,620
a lot of sanctions and you need to make

190
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,130
some money

191
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,779
Krypton is quite attractive after this

192
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,580
so the same piece of my life same well

193
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:06,260
iid be using some more real world

194
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,750
attacks about that point they're

195
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,880
pointing to some publicly available

196
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,260
nevermind servers so I think in this

197
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,639
case this is kind of Jeff's piece of

198
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,560
software they're probably just playing

199
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:17,000
around with obviously it could be

200
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,310
falsified and someone changed the main

201
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,800
name that I'm probably someone with a

202
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,479
finger it's the kind of thing just

203
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,520
because um this has nothing to do with a

204
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:27,590
cloud obviously that it's kind of

205
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,169
interesting because who's behind it this

206
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,880
is more malware so the same month that

207
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:33,109
one cry here and that was obviously a

208
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,779
music quite a bit

209
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,979
those were later set attackers quite

210
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:38,930
closely related based on code reuse

211
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:41,740
which that speakers talking about some

212
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:44,599
other stuff too and they started hitting

213
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,039
crypto exchanges in South Korea this is

214
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:47,810
the more they were deploying they were

215
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:49,310
sending across fake C visas deployed

216
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:53,029
this malware impersonates a piece of

217
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:54,650
South Korean forum software and they

218
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:56,750
stole like 20 million bucks from a

219
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,370
credulous change and then they've been

220
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,580
hitting impossible since then to now

221
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:03,169
it's kind of interesting top closed off

222
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,050
so yeah cryptocurrency also useful for

223
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:09,229
many things including

224
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:14,349
illicit transactions it's on to a more

225
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:16,490
kind of a cloudy things this time so

226
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:19,550
when most people talk about something

227
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:22,010
like crypto Jackie in the cloud is poor

228
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,630
the most common example so I know a

229
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:26,839
couple of people maybe you do too you've

230
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:29,930
had there a SS accounts from Michael so

231
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,969
it's very easy so if you like writing

232
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,890
some code and then you accidentally type

233
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:35,390
the command line your address key sounds

234
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,760
quite a lot and you bash history ends up

235
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,799
on github if you leave a variable name

236
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,789
AWS key in your code because I can get

237
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,589
hub what we see what happen pretty quick

238
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,180
within a couple of minutes is that you

239
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,890
have mouth people in your ad based

240
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,010
accounts spending up lots of easy to

241
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:53,290
traffic doing instances to mime Monaro

242
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,510
and the way that works is that github

243
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,230
has a fantastic search api you can find

244
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,000
him pretty easily

245
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,740
some people can't even see scanning sets

246
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,400
or the repos so it can spin up a bunch

247
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,350
of evil many other mining machines yeah

248
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,870
still a problem there's some good news

249
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:10,780
though so AWS versus if it happens to

250
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,160
you they were normally waive the fees if

251
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,930
you've let them know really quickly

252
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,490
they were also try to let you know as

253
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,160
well I talked about some malaise a day

254
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,860
detect that Amazon's released some code

255
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,240
as well on github ironically that you

256
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,000
can download and ran to keep checking

257
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,380
your public fit bucket and github

258
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,700
accounts to make sure we haven't

259
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,130
accidentally done this themselves so

260
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,260
suddenly aware of all the other problems

261
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:34,540
who happened to a friend of mine is that

262
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,920
when they run out of there's a lemonade

263
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,890
recipe how many machines you can spin up

264
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,120
to spin to mine cryptic currency and

265
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,920
they hit that limit they start taking

266
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,450
down new production service because they

267
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,430
want the mind more Manero before you can

268
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,510
I kick them out of your account so it

269
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:50,349
can be quite obvious when this happens

270
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:52,000
as well so Cuban notes or Cuban Nettie's

271
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,720
I never quite sure how to pronounce this

272
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,300
one next-gen DevOps infrastructure

273
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,550
service orchestration platform for

274
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,439
containers so basically run a bunch of

275
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,120
things like docker kind of virtual

276
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,090
machines if you're not familiar with

277
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,230
docker I guess the main point here is if

278
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,090
someone compromises the kubernetes

279
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,970
clusters then is bad because it's

280
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:14,980
multiple different machines potentially

281
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,690
like a lot of con next-gen devops tech

282
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,880
but doesn't have all the most authentic

283
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,620
ation built-in unless you know yeah she

284
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,570
goes round of enabling it same with

285
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:26,040
things like Mongo database you can you

286
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:30,120
can enable authentication but forget to

287
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:32,319
see others 18-thousand openly accessible

288
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,970
kubernetes clusters which isn't great

289
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,260
but a lot of them like this one here do

290
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:40,030
that authentication enabled

291
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:42,580
however Londo so this is searching again

292
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:44,380
this is this week be if there's 300

293
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,380
different servers that are all

294
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:49,390
compromised and the way we can tell

295
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,090
their compromise is because the Kuban

296
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,490
Etta's plus they're running a docker

297
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,990
container called y1 ee one one five

298
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:59,980
that's

299
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:02,370
container inspector mining see everyone

300
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,720
on that search page has a big problem

301
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,770
also credit turbine you actually showed

302
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,160
there with me they're two people at one

303
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:10,930
this kind of search engine this happened

304
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,880
to Tesla as well that was made on the

305
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,819
news last year Tesla had an issue where

306
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,110
they hadn't opened kubernetes cluster

307
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,600
someone logged in and they just spun

308
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,580
once if eclipta mining malware and run

309
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,750
all these machines obviously potentially

310
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,220
that could they're worse because you

311
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,630
know it was a test but had a bunch of

312
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,950
customer data in there around where cars

313
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,950
were that kind of personal information

314
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:34,330
the report on arm the mr. Tesla

315
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,070
compromised call that wasn't that bad

316
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,720
though you could see the domains of the

317
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,610
attackers were using so they were

318
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,370
sending all the mine cryptocurrency and

319
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:45,610
downloading updates for mr. mania X pay

320
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:47,380
x8 x8 up EU so I took a look at that

321
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,970
domain and the seriously using a bunch

322
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,399
of other attacks so the same people as

323
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:53,830
well as targeting the human s crosses

324
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,990
and done other software to in this case

325
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,339
they found a nice one durability I think

326
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,640
may develop themselves it's not public

327
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:02,560
available the Wester control panel which

328
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,959
is a lot like cPanel have used it before

329
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,569
this piece of software way you can like

330
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,069
deploy WordPress in certain other things

331
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,320
basically again it's kind of a

332
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:14,440
administration tools there are lots of

333
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,029
sub machines are guess

334
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,589
yeah I'm nothing too injured by the way

335
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:20,200
they're doing it generally when you have

336
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:21,790
a service compromised you'll see what

337
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,220
the attacker does is they they kill

338
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,709
competing miners because a lot of people

339
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,829
are also mining on there too so we can

340
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:31,060
see them running he kill an X Emery

341
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:32,739
Semmering is very what the mining tools

342
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,719
of know they all battle each other

343
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,089
continuously they'll do things like

344
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,800
install systems so if you ever have a

345
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,750
common title in this box with mining

346
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,969
malware you're probably finding a cron

347
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,230
tap so the set of scheduled tasks you

348
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,970
find they download in the rightness

349
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:49,180
JavaScript every day and just

350
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,550
continuously updating I also if you do

351
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,649
run better control panel there was a

352
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,189
while where their source code was

353
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:56,140
compromised

354
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,880
and every single installation investor

355
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,529
and Benedick's places out there they're

356
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,290
using them and password in stone off to

357
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:04,360
this server which isn't great and then

358
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,849
with em bokkeum minutes later I'm using

359
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,980
that's yeah train wreck earlier

360
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:13,180
security issue

361
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:15,490
docker yeah just FYI we call an image

362
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,949
from docker hub and need to check what's

363
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:20,260
in there so there's a good research most

364
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:22,720
about Trend Micro and they found if you

365
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,610
downloaded say Apache and PHP from dr.

366
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,000
Hopp Hopp is a place we can download

367
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:30,700
lots of production genes to docker

368
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,080
containers doctor often was actually

369
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,610
doors home in Aero minor there was

370
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,970
consensus running using up your let's

371
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,680
call some CPU cycles so yeah anything

372
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,050
done about the hub double check what is

373
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:44,680
in there this one still up but actually

374
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:48,579
I need to make a complaint another kind

375
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:51,729
of cloudy next Jenny issue CL eyes open

376
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,890
world accessible s3 buckets so there

377
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,380
couple of news websites with have an

378
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,819
issue last month where they were loading

379
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,310
all of their JavaScript resource and

380
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,020
their web pages from an s3 bucket which

381
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:04,270
is fine but they're set up in is well

382
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,380
drivable and then what happen because

383
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,449
they know I could basically write to

384
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,610
those attacker came in and they added

385
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,920
some code and what their code was doing

386
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:14,440
was doing in the minor without mining so

387
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,410
a bit like coin hive but on their own

388
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,600
custom code so if you're running AWS you

389
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,459
wanna obviously check missions aren't s3

390
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,290
buckets you hear more around that kind

391
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,000
of thing when like someone has their

392
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,500
personal data in s3 and they've let a

393
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,050
popular publicly but also people

394
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:33,460
couldn't attack through as well so yeah

395
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,410
I think I'm running away at a time so

396
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:39,940
you're very close to the plant organ

397
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:41,530
beer some ideas for detection so Yarra

398
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,970
rules if any of you analyze now

399
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,650
regularly he's very familiar with this

400
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,510
this is basically how you write your own

401
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,970
antivirus scanner this is the role that

402
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:52,150
we run to detect XM ring which is the

403
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,830
most popular miner out there three is

404
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,770
fine to basically look for a file on

405
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:58,660
your system with like the word X mining

406
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:01,060
in there that kind of thing see if fart

407
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:05,170
about on your database server or gonna

408
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:07,560
take a look at it spawned two ways you

409
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,790
can detect national mining as well so

410
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,199
things like a stratum Network protocol

411
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,420
this is kind of hard Bitcoin works

412
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,910
perhaps sends off and receives mining

413
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,410
jobs and works out how much money's made

414
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,790
that now South very easy that of a

415
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:21,310
network because it's not a message

416
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,480
protocol in itself so you can detect it

417
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:26,410
very easily

418
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,000
also have example Amazon AWS and my

419
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,069
suppose your that's a lot or in how they

420
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,360
will detect this too so they see this

421
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,190
car traffic coming out of your

422
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,010
environment there's often easy for them

423
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:37,990
stack than you because it's happening

424
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:40,120
the clouds can be a bit tricky I'm

425
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,250
destiny little learn you'll set it on

426
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,690
the command line to sippy CEO might be

427
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:47,139
machines something running the command

428
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:49,329
minor - o or something - oh by the way

429
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:51,220
stratum in there with um here's a

430
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:52,989
username and password that's something

431
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,040
maybe another time it's rate where you

432
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,320
have a little bit of program will begin

433
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,420
it's almost certainly a piece of mining

434
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,510
about malware or someone one of the

435
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,560
employees minority Emily and the way

436
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,579
that you detect this if you're not

437
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,649
really doing this new environment you

438
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:06,969
give it free so in Windows you have

439
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:08,829
system on some of us talked about

440
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,589
earlier you just track all the commands

441
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:13,540
that run on Linux we use OS Curie free

442
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:14,730
tool from Facebook you just check all

443
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,560
the commands that messed up too

444
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:20,019
similarly if someone's exploiting say

445
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,609
your Apache struts box you can obviously

446
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:23,110
right and network rule for that

447
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,180
it's not a sea Ricardo you can look for

448
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,069
what's fair and it's like free rulesets

449
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,630
and that does work quite well but you

450
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,310
also want to Namak lead attack the next

451
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:32,470
export to that you don't know exist yet

452
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:34,989
so you can do that by looking for things

453
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:37,810
like is your Apache Tomcat process

454
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:40,029
suddenly running bash its at running

455
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:43,300
flash - ISO interactively like a reverse

456
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:46,180
shell is suddenly your arm Java process

457
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,709
running something dodgy is yeah you get

458
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,239
the idea basically you can chain these

459
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:51,130
things together and you can't expose the

460
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,019
answer export you can generically detect

461
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,019
this bad activity it's pretty easy to do

462
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,779
small kind of cloudy things tend to

463
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,980
docker you see some parameters they have

464
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:02,260
been kicked up with the way the XM or

465
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,919
again pretty reliable detection we run

466
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:07,510
that that's any false positives yet

467
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,429
there's no proactive stuff so mention

468
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,740
people creating s3 buckets for the wrong

469
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:13,480
permissions you can alone that kind of

470
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,770
thing and watch out for it there's a

471
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,870
bunch of what kind of specific things

472
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,339
that AWS is your but aren't in the case

473
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,500
of their compromised or some zesty to

474
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:22,119
take an over entire a SS account you

475
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,730
might get a lot of that saying there's

476
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:26,349
been a lot of ec2 computing instances

477
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,150
somebody terminators is it coming off

478
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:30,219
your boxes so they can spend their own

479
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,260
you were to get alerts to for things

480
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,490
like there's a lot of boxes something

481
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,210
these spawn on a very short amount of

482
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,250
time Amazon have their own

483
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,620
custom thing where they'll hit you up as

484
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:42,549
well for an Amazon you hear on guard

485
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,570
duty you have to pay for that I believe

486
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:46,010
yeah

487
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,139
it's got some nice detectives in there

488
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:50,000
too and it kind of goes on top of some

489
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,710
of their other API so cloud trail is

490
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,690
basically the kind of API login server

491
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,669
to AWS it doesn't nice amount of stuff

492
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:57,679
on top of that flash you can write your

493
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:59,750
own rules too

494
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,059
if you want a summer stuff too so it's

495
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,760
security centered as your they have an

496
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:06,740
alert called Bitcoin tools the victim

497
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,539
falls out of a SS once as you'll have

498
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,830
one with life crypto mining and they're

499
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:12,950
pretty obvious what they are but you

500
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:14,240
know get the picture yeah and there's a

501
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,580
generic alerts with lots of different

502
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,289
things but in network of those two so I

503
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,740
mean most of these kind of mining

504
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:25,330
domains are blacklisted LaVon almost

505
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,330
built into should gonna let that stop do

506
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:39,559
that's it we didn't have to hold up any

507
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:53,840
signs if there are any questions or any

508
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:54,950
of that means hands of like the devops

509
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,139
tough that's what do you mean

510
00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:02,000
terms of the cloudy days yeah so some of

511
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,289
it is something isn't so the guy at the

512
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,299
front was nodding and tell it mean he

513
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:07,220
might know better I do be a lifeguard

514
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:09,230
you you have to pay for you enable it

515
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:16,490
power trail I think because that Mabel

516
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:18,970
by default think criterion wins yeah you

517
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:21,440
will get email from them lease in a

518
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,970
whispering stop see where like if it is

519
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,679
clearly Bitcoin mining and they'll based

520
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,520
in these notifications you but yeah you

521
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:27,890
don't be getting the full kind of

522
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,299
logging you're getting with nothing so

523
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:32,890
you have to turn the stuff on but it was

524
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:32,889
a much checklist but coming to us

525
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:46,309
Brendan going yeah I agree

526
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,230
it's kind of samples he has an add-on I

527
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:48,740
missed - that elastic search for samples

528
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,330
by mask

529
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,500
a product and now they actually don't

530
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,909
charge you actually have security

531
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,850
whereas since although last month they

532
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:58,400
did that's James I think marks have have

533
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,870
a slightly didn't ask you to they want

534
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,970
to have like their own security system

535
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:03,919
whereas Amazon's more like don't enable

536
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,770
partners took in a builder for them so

537
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:32,960
there's a bit of balancing out there but

538
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:35,030
yeah if you want to say something say

539
00:20:32,960 --> 00:21:03,470
for the video guard GT chicken coop it

540
00:20:35,030 --> 00:21:06,610
doesn't end everything and yeah ask that

541
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:08,840
while slice also never bill analysis I

542
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,459
think if I understand with guard duty

543
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,959
doesn't run like a host agent and now

544
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,210
it's more looking it's often the outside

545
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,460
which is why it's easy to deploy but it

546
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:23,630
means unlike a host agent it might miss

547
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:25,610
a bunch of stuff yeah yeah which is

548
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:27,860
tricky to detect from I think but on you

549
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,570
know it's easier to deploy it sir and

550
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,370
they obviously visual then they have

551
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:35,139
Windows Defender and after a protection

552
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:41,469
start them that's a few different things

553
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:41,470
anything else oh thank you very much

554
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,599
[Applause]
