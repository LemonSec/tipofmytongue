1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:12,420
so hi everyone so got to talk today so

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:14,730
this is essentially to talk about what I

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,529
think is probably kind of a key thing

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:22,290
for a lot of organizations to get right

5
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:24,480
and my focus now in my work is actually

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,970
working on small organizations so I am a

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,520
virtual see so is a thing it's a nicer

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,320
way of saying part-time I work with

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,360
organizations maybe a day a month maybe

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,160
two days and months maybe as a one-off

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,860
project and then I go back in three or

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,559
six months and see how things ago but

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,870
the point is is that a lot of these

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,720
organizations come to me and they might

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,809
be anywhere from five through to 300

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,140
people in headcount turnover can vary

17
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:54,169
massively from being a charity to being

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:57,059
up to towards 100 million pounds or more

19
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,260
so you get a whole range of different

20
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,480
people under that banner but their

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,860
initial assumption is is that they can't

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,300
do security because they either don't

23
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,509
have the budget they don't have the

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,819
people or you know anything I think

25
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:12,270
we've managed to somehow kind of up

26
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:14,609
turning like upturn security and focus

27
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,969
on completely the wrong things okay so

28
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:19,589
what's my background I was H key for as

29
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:21,298
a do th key for about six years I left

30
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,719
and went to the city about five years

31
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,130
ago worked in financial firms and got

32
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,919
bit bored of that about two years ago so

33
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,439
I went and set up by myself and started

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,359
doing this virtual seaside business so

35
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,428
that's kind of where I've been ow

36
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,788
so I want to start with something that I

37
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:40,499
think needs to be an honest assessment

38
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:42,539
of where we're at as an industry which

39
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:46,679
is that the majority of breaches that

40
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:48,359
you read about today are prevent one

41
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:49,649
thing I should highlight this isn't

42
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,779
really going to touch application

43
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,990
security so much this is much more

44
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:57,240
focused on generic both infrastructure

45
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,458
security and just the wire issues that

46
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,439
companies face so application security

47
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:02,759
is a part of that but I'm not focusing

48
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,029
specifically on that this is kind of a

49
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,679
wider topic but the majority of breaches

50
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:10,590
are preventable that's kind of where

51
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:13,620
we're starting from today so that then

52
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,760
leads to the question of why look why is

53
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,680
this happening

54
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,358
where are we at and I think I'm gonna go

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,819
through a few different layers of where

56
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:24,340
I think we're at son and start with like

57
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:26,200
from a strategic level how organizations

58
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,689
think about security their approach to

59
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,700
security the sort of the strip the

60
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:32,138
strategic barriers then there's a set

61
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,959
about implementation how do we actually

62
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:36,489
attempt to get secure like what's the

63
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,439
path that a lot of companies actually

64
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,359
take to implement security where are

65
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:41,920
some of the issues there the third is

66
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:44,379
going to be buying how to actually bring

67
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,208
people on board can I actually get the

68
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:48,280
buy-in to make it work and then the

69
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:49,720
fourth is assuming that you've done all

70
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,950
of that how do you actually check that

71
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,810
you've done it correct and how do you

72
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,700
maintain it going forward and some of

73
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:59,319
the issues around pentesting which is

74
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:02,108
not in any way issues with pen testers

75
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:05,349
it's how companies employ and use pen

76
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:07,419
testers so I think the first thing is

77
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:11,200
what's the approach that a lot of people

78
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:13,180
take when it comes to security and you

79
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,929
see something a culture that's very much

80
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:19,810
driven by trying to do quick wins and

81
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:22,680
why is that because it's really hard to

82
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:25,209
do long-term commitment to change

83
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,699
where's a great example where this is

84
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:29,409
evident legacy technology if you've got

85
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:31,780
an organization that is still heavily

86
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:35,108
reliant on legacy technology like legacy

87
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:38,019
operating systems there are good reasons

88
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:40,000
that those may still be in place in some

89
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:43,299
instances but the question is always

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,280
what's the plan and it's a topic that no

91
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:48,220
one ever wants to talk about why because

92
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,229
it's really really difficult but you

93
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,900
still have to come back and ask what's

94
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:54,549
the plan you cannot forever keep using

95
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,040
over operating systems that are no

96
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:58,569
longer supported you can't use Hardware

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,478
it's no longer supported there has to be

98
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:03,009
a plan and so I think this where you see

99
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:04,629
this sort of like approach and where you

100
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:07,689
see this clash it can come at different

101
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:10,328
levels right you might get on board a

102
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:12,668
sort of SEP senior at my execs who say

103
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:13,900
honestly this is a problem I don't

104
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,060
understand but I'm somehow responsible

105
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,250
for I just want this problem to go away

106
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,478
as quickly as possible from some of

107
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,220
these people's perspective if you've

108
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:23,020
been a board member for the last 20

109
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,450
years cybersecurity is a relatively new

110
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,870
topic it's come out of nowhere and so

111
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,919
your perspective might be this is a

112
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,600
been a problem for the last five years

113
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,010
and in five more years it might have

114
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,810
gone away and the next thing has come

115
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,190
around so some people still haven't

116
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,190
acknowledged that this is a long-term

117
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:40,350
problem that's here to stay

118
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,150
former CEO CEO type perspective and what

119
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,590
you might get is I actually want to

120
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,000
solve this problem but I'm really not

121
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,710
willing to commit the time or the

122
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,020
resource to actually do it I just kind

123
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,460
of want to I want to do as much as I

124
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,979
have to do but I really don't want to do

125
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,989
anything more on top of that you might

126
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:56,370
get a CTOs approach which is I want to

127
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,600
just solve this with technology and

128
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,150
that's the only approach that I'm

129
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,010
willing to take and you might even get a

130
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,198
CEO whose approach to solving security

131
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,180
is I expect to be here for two to three

132
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,500
years tops I'm not interested like it's

133
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,320
a lot of effort to put in place a

134
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,820
long-term organizational change I can do

135
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,520
some quick wins make it look good on my

136
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,639
CV and get out I these are all reasons

137
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,380
that you have for long term chain not

138
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,630
being present in organizations but you

139
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,580
have to acknowledge that that is one of

140
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,719
the things that is holding us back so

141
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,169
one of the analogies that I'm going to

142
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,210
use is I really like I think it works

143
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:32,250
quite well is I compare like the

144
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,549
security of an organization so obscurity

145
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,560
to weight loss right there is a general

146
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,810
sort of area where you would say right

147
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,099
most people a healthy weight is four

148
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,889
somewhere in this band

149
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:45,539
there's not one specific place that

150
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:48,750
everyone needs to get to but it's the

151
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:51,030
same rough area how easy is it to do

152
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,460
that some people you're already there

153
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,869
some people you are already where you

154
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,729
need to be there's nothing else you need

155
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,289
to do some people you're a little bit

156
00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:01,440
further away some people you're a long

157
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:03,570
way away right take two people one of

158
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,449
whom is relatively physically active and

159
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,979
eats quite well they might say okay I

160
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,630
need to lose a couple of pounds and I'll

161
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,820
actually be in that way you've got

162
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:16,590
someone who's 28 stone needs four pizzas

163
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:18,210
a day they cannot get to where they need

164
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,799
to be tomorrow that's just not going to

165
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,320
happen that is a long-term commitment

166
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,880
that they need to make now the other

167
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,860
problem you've got with this is I

168
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,210
sometimes go into clients and they're

169
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,620
the equivalent of the incredibly

170
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,750
unhealthy person eating four pizzas a

171
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,300
day I want to be healthy but I still

172
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,889
need to eat four pizzas a day that's a

173
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,380
challenge that you can't really overcome

174
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,000
and I think that's where you need to

175
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,710
have realistic expectations and goals

176
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,690
right if you are sitting there with

177
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:46,180
legacy technology all across your estate

178
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,460
and the management of the organization

179
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:52,660
believed themselves to be secure from a

180
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:54,159
sophisticated cyberattack know if you

181
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,750
believe yourself to be secure from

182
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,450
sophisticated cyber attacks and you're

183
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:02,620
still getting hit by eternal blue across

184
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:04,479
your network you're not like where can

185
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,060
you be based off like a realistic

186
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,320
expectation of this is where we are this

187
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,880
is where we can get to these are the

188
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,990
resources that we have and this is the

189
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,440
challenge that I've got with small

190
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,850
organizations they will never have huge

191
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,560
amounts of resources to throw at this

192
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,060
problem so it's all about trying to find

193
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,010
where is it that they need to prioritize

194
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,670
what is it that they can realistically

195
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,320
expect to get to another wheel bugbear

196
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,820
of mine is this if you are most people

197
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,310
what their security strategy is they

198
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,860
give you a list of tools a list of tools

199
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,860
is not a security strategy right it is

200
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,780
perfectly acceptable to use security

201
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,090
technologies as long as you actually

202
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,650
know why you're using them what is it

203
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,000
that they're actually doing for you and

204
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,510
if you didn't have that what you could

205
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,050
do instead

206
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:48,219
like patching is a great example

207
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,580
application patching from end-user

208
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:53,710
devices operating system patching it's a

209
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,930
fairly straightforward process but

210
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,820
actually the more complex your state the

211
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,290
larger it is the more applications that

212
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,050
your end-users use the heart of this

213
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,360
problem becomes and at some point it may

214
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,160
be a better idea to go to a third party

215
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,230
and buy their off-the-shelf application

216
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,940
an OS patching tool deploy across your

217
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,470
environment that's fine because you know

218
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,050
why you have that product and you know

219
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,910
what it's delivering what I see is a

220
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,920
whole bunch of and ceases are sometimes

221
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,720
the worse for this they basically say I

222
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,520
want this product and you ask them

223
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,620
what's that actually delivering for you

224
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,450
tell me how that reduces your risk what

225
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,240
you get back sounds suspiciously like

226
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:30,010
the marketing material for the products

227
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,500
I mean it might be on the back of that

228
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,789
slide but we don't I've used it and

229
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,200
actually I would have good things to say

230
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:37,959
about it but I'd have very bad things to

231
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,080
say about their marketing team but where

232
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,870
do you get to ensure is this it is we

233
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,540
are looking for I can solve your

234
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,860
problems if you you don't need to commit

235
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,500
to that long-term change you don't

236
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,330
really need to struggle like just buy

237
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,250
this and your problem goes away

238
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,570
everyone's going to love you the clouds

239
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,180
will part it will be fine

240
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:01,180
right and we are just ignoring the real

241
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:04,120
problem here so this is what to me is

242
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,229
the crux now again I can say all of this

243
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,990
because I like to work with small

244
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:10,269
vendors small organizations you can't

245
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:12,130
really walk into an organization of 250

246
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:14,470
people that is so broken it's not

247
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,500
fixable go up to an organization of tens

248
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,149
of hundreds of thousands of people and

249
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,199
it's a dumpster fire an IT estate and I

250
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:22,329
would just walk back out the other door

251
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:23,889
because some of these things I have

252
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:25,870
really really hard problems and I

253
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:28,720
recognize that I am sort of saying that

254
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,339
I don't work with big businesses because

255
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,959
they can be too hard to solve I

256
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:34,420
sometimes wonder if they can even be

257
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:35,529
secure at the scale they're at but I

258
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,149
like to work with small businesses

259
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:40,180
because you can get them to a good place

260
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:41,529
fairly easily and that's one good thing

261
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,120
to talk about here which is when we talk

262
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:46,500
about that back to basics let's not

263
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,880
assume that basics are easy like basics

264
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,970
they might be simple there might be like

265
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,009
like fairly simple kind of philosophies

266
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,110
or fairly simple like principles to

267
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:58,870
stick to but scale is what makes them

268
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:02,050
complicated installing a patch on a

269
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:04,060
server easy installing patches across

270
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,769
ten servers that's still fairly

271
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,319
straightforward ten thousand servers

272
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:09,550
that's a monster task and good luck

273
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:11,800
trying to do that in any reasonable

274
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,149
timeframe with a whole set of businesses

275
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,779
that are going to have competing demands

276
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:19,180
on those service types right so it's not

277
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:20,920
easy to do the basics well but that is

278
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,959
not a reason to skip over them and not

279
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,459
do them yes they're hard but they are

280
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,329
still the critical things that you need

281
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:29,349
to do so with that in mind what we're

282
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:32,680
actually talking about with basic

283
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:34,029
controls I've got three lists MCFC 10

284
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,439
steps reducing the impact that's

285
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:37,899
probably the highest level of all of

286
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,610
them C is critical controls is one of

287
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:41,800
the others my favorite by far remains

288
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:44,470
the asd essentially that's rebranded I

289
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,510
think now to the ACS see because ASD is

290
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,220
the Australian of equivalent of GHQ

291
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:51,670
they've stood up their Australian

292
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,380
cybersecurity Center anyone who hasn't

293
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:56,529
seen this list they have been publishing

294
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:58,779
this this since about 2010 and it is

295
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:00,880
fantastic and it is the best prioritized

296
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:03,970
cybersecurity guidance you will see they

297
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,139
have a top 35 controls and as of a few

298
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,550
years ago what they do is now they've

299
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:08,920
score all of those as to whether they're

300
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,930
essential helpful useful

301
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,760
there were eight the get marked is

302
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:16,149
essential that cover the full range of

303
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,160
different there's still quite external

304
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:21,850
threat focus there like stopping sort of

305
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,069
intrusions into systems controls but

306
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,810
they are they run the full gauntlet of

307
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,240
the sort of the spread of controls that

308
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,699
you need they are also very clearly

309
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,800
prioritized by how much it costs how

310
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:34,630
much user resistance you'll meet and how

311
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,579
effective they are so you can really

312
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,980
actually start to see how useful these

313
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:40,899
things are and again this is a critical

314
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,329
thing in my view this all comes before

315
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,760
you've got any detection the essentially

316
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:47,979
has no detection controls it essentially

317
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,180
also doesn't have antivirus I think they

318
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,980
were making more of appointment that

319
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,680
than anything else but antivirus is not

320
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,510
in the essential eight right because

321
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,649
it's not actually that critical anymore

322
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,689
there's a lot of stuff that it is quite

323
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:00,639
a useful for but there is a lot of other

324
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:03,579
stuff you should be looking at doing and

325
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,110
detection I'll come onto this a little

326
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:06,760
bit later but a lot of companies will

327
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,320
jump straight to having good detection

328
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,470
and all that does is means you are then

329
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,060
fighting fires right and you never

330
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,820
actually get the time so then implement

331
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,109
the rest of the controls detection is

332
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,519
only useful when you've actually got a

333
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,410
set of controls to slow down your

334
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,810
attacker right if you think of like a

335
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,939
cyber attack as a race like the

336
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,349
detection is the starter gun for you but

337
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,000
the attacker may have already started a

338
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,230
long time before right so the starter

339
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,170
pistol goes in the attack is already

340
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:34,120
halfway down the track detect like

341
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:36,189
preventative controls like the stuff

342
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,589
that's in the essential aids so op o s

343
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,959
patching end-user application patching

344
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:43,480
privilege control multi-factor

345
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,219
authentication application whitelisting

346
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,899
like these are the sorts of things that

347
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,940
act as debris in the way of the attacker

348
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:51,279
and it slows them down right without

349
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,319
that you've got no chance of actually

350
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,510
responding to an incident all you can do

351
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:57,959
is recover like responding to an

352
00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,310
incident is catching one in process

353
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:02,140
stopping it and then undoing the damage

354
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,939
you have no hope of doing that that

355
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,490
incident will get complete before you

356
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,290
have the chance to actually get in front

357
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,120
of the attacker so all you're going to

358
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,620
be doing is recovery so detection

359
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,120
doesn't really buy you that much it just

360
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,779
lets you do your recovery potentially a

361
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,779
little bit sooner and what else does

362
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:21,430
basic mean well they're free they're not

363
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:22,510
free but they're kind of free they look

364
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,250
free

365
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,990
you don't actually spend any money on

366
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:29,680
them but you're gonna spend more time

367
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:32,530
and effort and resource so are they free

368
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,510
well I don't know but also like we said

369
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,740
earlier at some point when you scale you

370
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,560
might want to spend some money on them

371
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,870
because actually spending a bit of money

372
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,489
saves three people's time because one

373
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:45,340
technology product can manage that

374
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,780
system more effectively here's my view

375
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,420
in an SME you shouldn't have a cyber

376
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,680
budget it's unnecessary it distracts

377
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,810
from the goal of what you're trying to

378
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,189
achieve which is that somehow cyber is a

379
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:57,489
separate thing that you need to spend

380
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,900
money on like fully agreed there in

381
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,040
larger organizations this is not

382
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,510
practical and you need to have that

383
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,890
money assigned but in a smaller

384
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,390
organization there is no need because

385
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,620
actually the critical things that you

386
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:09,160
need to do when you go and look down

387
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,360
that list of the essentially they're all

388
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,060
things that will probably be done by you

389
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,620
whoever controls your itst and so

390
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,359
actually from my perspective when I

391
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,490
wasn't in house II so and people would

392
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,780
ask me if I needed more budget I said if

393
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,390
you're going to do that by downsizing

394
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,430
the window server team by a person no

395
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,660
because I'll lose patching I'll lose

396
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,569
privilege controller lose all these

397
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:30,670
other things just to buy an extra

398
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:33,850
analyst to partially cover that risk

399
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,110
that you've created managed service

400
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,420
providers won't do all of these by

401
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,040
default think about a managed service

402
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,839
provider who manages an IT estate if

403
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,939
your organization doesn't have internal

404
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,040
IT here's what they're gonna do they're

405
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,570
gonna say we're gonna go out to where

406
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,490
someone else and we're gonna pay that

407
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,830
company to manage our IT network and

408
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:52,570
their whole sort of contract value is

409
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,330
going to be based on them delivering us

410
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,770
a working itst

411
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,750
what incentive do they have to put in

412
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,800
place potentially disruptive security

413
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:03,430
controls what application whitelisting

414
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,079
to any level they're not going to get

415
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,339
thanks for it all they're gonna get is

416
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,290
if it goes wrong they're gonna get in

417
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,480
trouble so again some of this stuff is

418
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,219
not in and IT teams incentive to

419
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,200
actually do naturally so you have to

420
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,170
request it or you have to say look this

421
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,220
is the standard that we expect you to me

422
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,810
and the other thing about these controls

423
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,450
is they're not binary they are not on or

424
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:24,459
off their dials not switches right so

425
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:26,260
actually the question isn't do we have

426
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,390
this control application whitelisting is

427
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,439
a classic for this if I say application

428
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,819
whitelisting are probably a lot of

429
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,950
you've just clenched up because you're

430
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:35,290
thinking full hash-based application

431
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,380
whitelisting which requires a team of 20

432
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,360
people to manage

433
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,130
I would argue the very first step in

434
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,140
application whitelisting might be

435
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:44,750
something as simple as using a block and

436
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:47,120
not to not allow unsigned applications

437
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,829
to run that is a form of application

438
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,240
whitelisting how far is that gonna get

439
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:51,380
you it's gonna get you a little way

440
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,970
along with it it's not gonna get you

441
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,820
very far but it's gonna get you that's a

442
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,430
good chunk that's a good chunk of just

443
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:00,410
craps that is not going to work anymore

444
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:02,540
office service office restrictions on

445
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,790
things like macros is that in a

446
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,069
application whitelisting sort of it's

447
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:10,189
about not allowing unknown code to run

448
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,930
macros are unknown code office macros

449
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:14,779
right I work across financial

450
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:17,120
organizations finance organizations use

451
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:19,820
Excel macros to turn over like probably

452
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,290
trillions of dollars of the UK for

453
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,560
global economy because it's across the

454
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:26,269
US and UK Excel macros run most of

455
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,939
world's finance and that should scare

456
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:29,959
you as much as it scares me but they

457
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,850
don't need word and they don't do

458
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:34,640
PowerPoint so you can turn those off

459
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,980
really quickly like yes you can't do

460
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,209
much about Excel macros so then you have

461
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,920
to look at how well so you can solve

462
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:42,050
that risk but again it's sort of like

463
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,370
these are not just full on or full off

464
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:45,290
there are bits that you can do when it's

465
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,430
what level you implement them to and

466
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,939
that's where I want to come on to now

467
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:52,099
which is realistic goals and realistic

468
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,480
expectations like what are you actually

469
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,490
talking about when it comes to cyber

470
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,620
threat the majority of what we're

471
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,149
talking about is untargeted they don't

472
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,769
know who you are they don't care they've

473
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:02,329
never even heard of you as an

474
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:05,199
organization as an individual whatever

475
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:09,319
it is just mass market spray and pray

476
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,640
wherever I land I'll and right that is

477
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:15,829
the bulk of what you're talking about

478
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:19,459
and that is all handled by doing things

479
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:20,869
like the basics well right there is a

480
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:22,459
level on top of that which I would call

481
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:26,030
like the basic targeted they know who

482
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:27,500
you are like I am an attacker I want to

483
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,299
deploy ransomware I'm gonna look through

484
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,590
a list of quite well-off companies that

485
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:33,379
might be quite small but have quite high

486
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:35,209
turnover I'm gonna try to put ransomware

487
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,919
IAM because if it gets in I can get like

488
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:40,130
maybe a few hundred thousand in a ransom

489
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:41,390
if it bounces off or it doesn't work I'm

490
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,850
not coming back I'm just going to move

491
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:46,130
to the next one on my list so it's a

492
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:49,189
little bit targeted but it's not they

493
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,550
don't really care then there's the okay

494
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,880
they

495
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:55,370
want in you or your information or it's

496
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,710
actually you're part of a wider supply

497
00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:00,350
chain that they're trying to infiltrate

498
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:03,920
they will come back they may remember

499
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:05,840
like takeshi's Castle or I think was

500
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,580
called it's a knock out but this is my

501
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,669
idea of like the types of attackers

502
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:14,000
right if your security setup is like a

503
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:16,880
sort of like Total Wipeout sort of run

504
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,500
an attacker who gets to run it once will

505
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,390
probably get knocked in the water fairly

506
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,490
early on right the chances are someone

507
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,080
give them one of these things to run

508
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,750
without any prep can get through all of

509
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,730
those stages is very very low but these

510
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,500
guys at the top they're gonna come back

511
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,120
and so they get knocked in the water but

512
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,670
then they read it and given infinite

513
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,229
numbers of tries to run this corner you

514
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,550
never change those controls they will

515
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,470
eventually learn them all and they'll be

516
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,629
able to complete the whole course right

517
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:44,090
so the danger with these is not their

518
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:45,950
sophistication it's their targeting it's

519
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,600
their ability to come back and learn

520
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,940
from their previous mistakes that's what

521
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,370
makes these guys so dangerous right it's

522
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,620
not a zero day it's the fact that this

523
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,209
didn't work so they're gonna refocus it

524
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,250
and send it back in and they've got this

525
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:00,980
far and they're just gonna slowly edge

526
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:03,080
further and further and then at the very

527
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,810
top the people that get by far the most

528
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,730
coverage the apt groups right which

529
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:09,230
define the difference between the face

530
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:12,350
together and the apt I don't know

531
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:13,670
because a lot of the e clamp groups look

532
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,709
better than China China

533
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:18,020
he'd getting the most coverage with

534
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:20,060
North Korea's better than China NSO

535
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,910
Group suddenly pop up and you know they

536
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,870
get like and exploit and all of a sudden

537
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,450
that's what everyone's talking about

538
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:28,040
again if you're at that level where that

539
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:30,260
is a sophisticated thing that you need

540
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,399
to worry about like you need to

541
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,960
acknowledge that that's the level you

542
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,550
need to be everywhere but this is the

543
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,410
other argument which is you need to

544
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,629
figure out where you are on this pyramid

545
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:41,900
what level of security you were actually

546
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:43,790
aiming to achieve because the companies

547
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:48,230
who are aiming for that top that have

548
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:49,670
Levicy technology you've got no hope so

549
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,650
what do we actually map onto this this

550
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:54,470
is my view of where the basics cover you

551
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:56,680
right I'm using the five miss pillars

552
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:59,650
here identification protection detection

553
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,670
response and recovery right so

554
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,700
identification protection and recovery

555
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:05,670
is the basics

556
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:08,310
know your assets do basic IT hygiene and

557
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:10,050
have a recovery process in place not a

558
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,149
response process of recovery process

559
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:14,370
you're not going to intercept any attack

560
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:16,410
in progress you're just going to recover

561
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,969
from it when it happens restore from

562
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:21,030
backups white machines whatever you need

563
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:23,430
to do you just recover and move on that

564
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:26,399
gets you even into some of the targets

565
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:28,410
if you're doing this well that will slow

566
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,210
down even a targeted attack but remember

567
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:33,300
the targeted attack if they get to come

568
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:35,550
back we'll learn this course and even

569
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,990
the basic targeted maybe there'll be a

570
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,649
little bit smarter to jump through some

571
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,780
of those hoops

572
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,340
so this is where SEC Ops then sort of

573
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,410
kicks in and that's your other two main

574
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,810
pillars of detection in the spots right

575
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,940
but it layers on top of your detect of

576
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:49,830
your preventative controls because your

577
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,060
preventative controls are what slow down

578
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,699
the attacker within your environment

579
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:55,530
enough fee to actually be able to detect

580
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,270
and respond to them without those

581
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,040
actually slowing them down you could

582
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:01,320
have all the fancy detection technology

583
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,909
that you want all you're going to get is

584
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,110
by the time the alerts actually come in

585
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,760
from the tool or the third-party

586
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,320
provider that you use they've already

587
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,200
got two main admin got the credentials

588
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,250
and they're out the door because

589
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,850
actually responding to one of these

590
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:17,910
incidents still takes enough time and

591
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:19,320
finally red team threat hunting those

592
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,060
sorts of more advanced features yeah if

593
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,139
you are after a sophisticated attack

594
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,120
who's going to run your gauntlet

595
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,780
repeatedly you need to prep for that and

596
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,090
train for it

597
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:29,520
but you only need to do it if that's the

598
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,929
level you go like if that's the level

599
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,410
you're trying to keep out that's what

600
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:36,060
you should test against if you're not do

601
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,320
you really need to hire some red teamers

602
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:40,110
I know it sounds cool and sounds great

603
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:42,570
but in reality what are they going to

604
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,800
tell you more comments on a minute so

605
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,419
here's the other thing very quickly

606
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,490
about implementation I think companies

607
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,780
get wrong if you think of these as the

608
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,630
strands so identity protect a tech

609
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,730
worker then what they do is this they go

610
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:55,470
straight into built with I'm going to

611
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,910
put in place the most amazing detection

612
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,710
technology in the world what does that

613
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,460
start doing detecting loads of security

614
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,860
events because you've got no

615
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,540
preventative controls oh crap what do we

616
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,250
need to do well let's get a really good

617
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,740
response and recovery process in place

618
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,510
fine you're probably using third-party

619
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,190
instant response and at this point any

620
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,990
hope of budget that you had has been

621
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:16,050
blown out the door because turns out

622
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,740
firing mandiant are cheap so where do

623
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,450
you get their left

624
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,740
well maybe we should do some identity we

625
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,789
should put and say some policies and

626
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,710
things like this in the dues like I

627
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:24,720
didn't ask the identification etc fine

628
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,000
but you still haven't done the stuff

629
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,529
that is the protection and actually well

630
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,779
before now your budgets run out so you

631
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:31,289
never get time to do that so where you

632
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:33,929
end up

633
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:38,190
most companies end up maybe there maybe

634
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:41,039
they're right instead a basic set of

635
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,870
controls will do a lot more built up if

636
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,908
you need to go to that level if you're

637
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,139
worried about more targeted stuff yes if

638
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:47,760
you're worried about highly

639
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,190
sophisticated then you need to go to

640
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,129
this level but it's still about doing it

641
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:54,360
in those layers this is going to make

642
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,799
really no sense then there is another

643
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,418
version of this that I'll show you on

644
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,559
the next slide but this is also the

645
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,450
argument of when you're talking about

646
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,639
security operations and you're talking

647
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,190
about detection there's all sorts of

648
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,700
cliches floating around like perimeter

649
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:10,260
security is dead bla bla bla but as long

650
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,740
as you think about attack paths

651
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:16,620
it's a cyber security breach is not one

652
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,840
one incident it is not one thing that

653
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,330
happened it is a whole chain of events

654
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,549
that got put together and every single

655
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:26,639
one of those events was your opportunity

656
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:29,100
to block or detect that that activity

657
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,440
was occurring right so the idea out

658
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:33,360
there that is somehow sold by a lot of

659
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,490
vendors and people have is that someone

660
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,260
in you know on HR clicks on the wrong

661
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:39,000
email and a production sequel data walks

662
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,620
out the door it's like no no no no no

663
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,690
there were many many steps between those

664
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,428
two things that happened and this is one

665
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,860
attempt for me when I was in house to

666
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:48,870
try to like show people here's where we

667
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,549
spend our money here's why we have these

668
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:52,620
different security tools in place here's

669
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:55,049
what our security detection framework is

670
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,299
around and some of these are processes

671
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:58,950
that we run some of them are technology

672
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:01,260
tools it's more simple than it looks

673
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,360
it's a layering of basic controls in

674
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,350
detection but again what you find is a

675
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,908
lot of companies will get to

676
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:07,500
installation and there's no there's no

677
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:09,029
further controls right so if you

678
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,070
actually were to try to map yours out

679
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:12,600
you've got okay you've got great

680
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,250
perimeter security because you've got an

681
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,408
IDs you've got email filtering you've

682
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,750
got you know and you've got an advanced

683
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:21,360
and next-gen a vida tection on your

684
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,950
desktop great very great but the macro

685
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,219
that just got through managed to bypass

686
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:28,409
all of those what is there to stop it

687
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:30,119
nothing okay so actually it's very much

688
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:32,009
that passed a certain

689
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:33,839
pointing your attackers free and easy

690
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:35,939
and that's not what you want you want

691
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,059
them to face resistance the whole way

692
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:40,499
through that attack path the idea here

693
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:43,199
is very much around spreading your

694
00:24:40,499 --> 00:24:44,789
controls out and not clustering here is

695
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:46,169
another way that I then presented it

696
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:47,339
later where I had different colors to

697
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:49,349
represent different types of things but

698
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:50,999
again it's the idea that like actually

699
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:52,349
you have to start all the way on the

700
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:54,809
left and you have to go all the way to

701
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:55,979
the right and again this is a thing that

702
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:57,329
I want to come on to you later but it's

703
00:24:55,979 --> 00:24:58,739
like if you're going to pen test and

704
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,448
you're saying to the pen testers come on

705
00:24:58,739 --> 00:25:02,879
site acknowledge that what you're

706
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:05,159
starting to test is that middle on words

707
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:06,899
you're not testing those first two so

708
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:10,889
you have to put those results in context

709
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:12,299
as well anyway in summary one big heap

710
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:14,938
of controls is no good what you really

711
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:17,309
want is to spread fine so implementation

712
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:19,469
this is great right how are you gonna

713
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:20,908
get buy-in if you haven't seen to nobble

714
00:25:19,469 --> 00:25:22,589
these next few slides I'm really going

715
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:24,509
to make no level of sense whatsoever but

716
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:26,908
the message still comes clear like so

717
00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:28,919
some people don't take bad news well and

718
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:30,839
if you haven't seen Chernobyl spoiler

719
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,989
with a power plant explodes but it's

720
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:36,059
really about it's really about decision

721
00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:38,069
making in the Soviet Union which I love

722
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:40,589
I think that was that word to me was the

723
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:42,059
crux of the show like people do not

724
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:44,819
accept bad news when it is told to them

725
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:45,839
no matter no matter how obvious and you

726
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:47,279
need to think about this when you're

727
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:48,779
selling something right so you've done a

728
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,629
review inside your company you've said

729
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:53,969
look actually how privilege management

730
00:25:51,629 --> 00:25:55,349
is terrible

731
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:57,389
what you need to think about is who are

732
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:59,218
you presenting this to right because

733
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,928
what you may be presenting you to is the

734
00:25:59,219 --> 00:26:02,339
person who is responsible for that

735
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:04,349
privilege management and all you're

736
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:07,379
saying is you're pretty terrible at your

737
00:26:04,349 --> 00:26:09,239
job and it's a huge risk to the firm may

738
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:11,218
not go down the best way right so you

739
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:12,569
have to think about what is the message

740
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:15,089
that you're actually presenting who are

741
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:17,339
you presenting it to and what are they

742
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:19,168
going to hear like so some of this is

743
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:21,208
about tailoring your message so that you

744
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:23,519
can say look here are some risks here

745
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:25,529
are some options etc but the key thing

746
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,059
is that just because you've found

747
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:28,859
something that's particularly worrying

748
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,749
not everyone else is going to be happy

749
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:32,579
to hear that news right you are

750
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:34,469
identifying problems that is going to

751
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:36,719
cause other people work to have to fix

752
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:37,979
it I say you just need to kind of take

753
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:40,169
that into account is something I've

754
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:42,269
really found the second is this is that

755
00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:43,980
you obviously need to be honest right

756
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:46,440
honesty is the key thing

757
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:49,500
but context matters more than anything

758
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:52,200
else so again in the show they keep

759
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,120
quoting how much radiation is there 3.6

760
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,120
Monken because the meters that they had

761
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,070
capped out at 3 so the true level was

762
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,469
way way higher this is technically a

763
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:03,510
true number but the context is we don't

764
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,580
know this is not really a valid test

765
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:07,770
right this is another thing I see in

766
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:10,530
security right there is an issue with

767
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,970
something a critical server like a

768
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:14,760
production server has a critical

769
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,410
vulnerability that sounds bad right but

770
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,210
actually what are the compensating

771
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:21,150
controls does that server face the

772
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:22,410
internet no okay well so internally

773
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:24,890
who's got access to it

774
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:28,380
it's a vulnerability that's present on

775
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:30,630
RDP but not the web ports okay but it's

776
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,840
actually in a VLAN that RDP is

777
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,250
restricted to one jump box okay it's not

778
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,220
actually suddenly sound in that bad

779
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:40,380
anymore and if you go in sort of like

780
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:42,120
alarmist which again this will tell

781
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,770
alarmism is not a good thing in the

782
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,299
Soviet Union but go in with your

783
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,860
alarmist view and people just won't

784
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:50,190
listen to you right you have to provide

785
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:52,110
context how big a deal is this you don't

786
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,490
get that many occasions to sort of like

787
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,620
set your hair on fire and mother man say

788
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:57,330
you really need to focus on this so use

789
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:02,280
them when it matters and don't waste

790
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:06,590
them it really is a case of well I think

791
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,590
this is key is helping people who

792
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:12,690
understand risk right and they're not

793
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,640
gonna take a piece of technology or a

794
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,260
theoretical vulnerability and

795
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,320
necessarily be able to contextualize

796
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,990
that talk about a possible attack but a

797
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,040
great example for this for me is

798
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:25,320
privileged account management right

799
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,600
where you see that especially privileged

800
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,700
users have that access on their primary

801
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,750
account so the email that they're

802
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,340
checking their email they're browsing

803
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,010
the web and they're doing domain admin

804
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,510
tasks or using one account right you see

805
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,669
that quite a lot because people don't

806
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,500
think about why it's a risk and you can

807
00:28:38,669 --> 00:28:42,600
sit down with even a CEO and you say

808
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,830
right okay someone clicks on an email

809
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,469
and that email has a malicious

810
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:49,889
attachment that attachment executes as

811
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:51,450
that user so this user has privileged

812
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:53,730
access to every single computer in your

813
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,049
organization that means that whilst they

814
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,830
think they're really security conscious

815
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:59,620
because they're a domain administrator

816
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:01,060
you understand technology if if they

817
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:03,550
actually make a mistake and click on the

818
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:05,500
wrong email that attachment that

819
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:06,610
malicious software has suddenly

820
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,610
inherited rights over your entire

821
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:11,590
computer state and you've got no ability

822
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:13,719
to stop that like end-to-end it can then

823
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,490
just start stealing credentials jumping

824
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,320
to other computers it can work its way

825
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,580
across your entire organization right

826
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,129
and that's an attack part they can

827
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:23,080
understand and you say versus that

828
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,370
person has two accounts and they check

829
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,960
their email on this account and then

830
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:27,489
when they need to go and do server tasks

831
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,800
they have to right click and run as or

832
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:31,900
RDP to a different machine but there is

833
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,720
a firebreak and at that point if this

834
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:37,240
account clicks on the wrong email or the

835
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,100
wrong attachment there is no automated

836
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,480
hop there is sometimes you know

837
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,310
obviously yes you could have some

838
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,920
vulnerability that's a privilege

839
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:47,110
escalation etc but your principle is it

840
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,120
provides a firebreak there are always

841
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,770
going to be work arounds etc but that's

842
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,879
a really good example of if you want

843
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,230
bring someone on board for doing a

844
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,960
change like that you have to be able to

845
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:57,640
explain to them how can this actually be

846
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,960
used to hurt you in a way that they can

847
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:04,480
understand finally this is the key thing

848
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,010
even if you're the seaso how secure your

849
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,790
organization is is not your decision

850
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:11,710
right it is not your decision someone

851
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:13,210
else should be making if the business is

852
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,440
saying it's your decision it's not your

853
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:17,100
decision and they are not paying you

854
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,810
enough to make that choice right it's

855
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:24,490
security is not an isolated thing it's

856
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:27,129
all a balance right so if you want to do

857
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:28,900
you know you've got we've got on-premise

858
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,100
email we're moving to the cloud we're

859
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,630
moving to the cloud and it's going to

860
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,550
save us X thousand pounds every year

861
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,440
it's gonna save us eighty thousand

862
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:38,320
pounds a year business decides it wants

863
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,760
to do it great just one note you are

864
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,830
changing our email infrastructure from

865
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,180
being accessible only through this like

866
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,260
limited window through to being

867
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,120
accessible to anywhere in the world

868
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:49,360
because you've decided to go office 365

869
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,649
so if we've got weak passwords they're

870
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,290
going to be far more exposed than they

871
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:55,150
were previously that's not your decision

872
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:56,830
as to which way the business goes as

873
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:00,400
long as they understand both sides of

874
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:01,750
that so my job isn't to it's to give

875
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,390
people the information to make that

876
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:07,540
decision it's not to tell them what

877
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:09,100
decision to make now if they say we're

878
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,600
going to go office 365 we're not gonna

879
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,909
deploy multi-factor we don't think

880
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,860
that's a risk at all I will obviously

881
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:17,110
strongly advocate that I don't believe

882
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:19,570
that to be accurate but the key thing is

883
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:21,129
it is someone else's decision and all

884
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:24,549
you need to do is provide them the

885
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:26,620
information to help them make that now

886
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,970
finally okay you've got some buying

887
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,350
you're going to do some implementation

888
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,270
you've got a set of critical controls

889
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:34,539
you think you've done it

890
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:36,460
what about testing here's the very first

891
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:38,440
thing about pan testing its companies

892
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,570
use it to define their security strategy

893
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,710
so many people I know will say well

894
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:44,860
we're going to find out what we need to

895
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:46,360
do is we're going to do a pen test a SD

896
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,250
essential eight is online in his free

897
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,320
pen testers are like twelve fifty a day

898
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:52,510
maybe a bit less in some areas but

899
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,030
London rates is pushing twelve fifty day

900
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:57,158
now you don't patch you're gonna pay for

901
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,870
two people to come in for three days and

902
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:01,690
the main part of their report is you

903
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:03,250
don't patch yeah I could have probably

904
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:08,890
saved you the ten grand I just told you

905
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:11,049
that I'd have done that five even a lot

906
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,640
of your controls are paper-based

907
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:14,470
and you can self assess against them

908
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,570
because you should know and if you don't

909
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,789
know that's probably a bigger problem

910
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:20,649
than where you're at if you don't know

911
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:21,970
any of the level of security controls

912
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:24,159
that embedded in your organization

913
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:27,100
getting a pen test to tell you where you

914
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,480
are now is a point in time but you need

915
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,219
to have the process in place to actually

916
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,010
understand how those positions are

917
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:35,020
changing over time what are you actually

918
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,908
looking to learn from this test this

919
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,590
comes back to my previous point if your

920
00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:40,630
whole business strategy if your whole

921
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:42,490
cybersecurity strategy is we want to be

922
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:44,919
protected from that internet background

923
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:46,929
noise those untargeted attacks we don't

924
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:49,299
see sophisticated targeted attacks on

925
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:50,919
our radar why are you paying fifty grand

926
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:53,679
for a red team engagement for this next

927
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:56,559
two weeks because I'm gonna give you a

928
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,059
hint they're gonna get in and quite

929
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,320
often you see companies that don't do

930
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,908
privileged management and they don't do

931
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,980
patching and they're getting red teaming

932
00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:04,419
and your life again they're gonna get in

933
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,650
and they're gonna get in because you

934
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:09,730
don't do patching a privilege management

935
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:13,059
and it's a fairly simple answer but yeah

936
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:14,650
this is repeatedly I I don't quite still

937
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:16,809
understand why and this isn't a digger

938
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:19,480
pen test like this is I come from

939
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:21,340
financial services like where pen

940
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,870
testing is also known as you know how

941
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,428
expensive is it to really just take a

942
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:27,070
box and it turns out the answer could be

943
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:29,169
very expensive but there are people who

944
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,189
just want a pen test and they don't even

945
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:31,960
know what that means that they don't

946
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:34,090
care what it means and it's a critical

947
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,690
part of you've implemented some basic

948
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:39,428
controls you've implemented patching

949
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:41,470
privilege management multi-factor

950
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:42,730
authentication you've even done a little

951
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,929
bit of application whitelisting by

952
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:46,059
blocking some macros and a few other

953
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:47,799
bits and pieces right so go to a pen

954
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:50,259
testing company and let them sell you a

955
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:52,960
scope to do X Y Zed of like two weeks

956
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:54,399
internal testing no all we want you to

957
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,169
do is come in and verify that these

958
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,090
things that we think we implemented are

959
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:59,499
implemented correctly right there are

960
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:01,119
some other systems that are coming onto

961
00:33:59,499 --> 00:34:02,350
the market that are more automated if

962
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,119
you're running some of this stuff

963
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:05,889
manually you might run an internal nexus

964
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:08,558
or squalus system that can help you some

965
00:34:05,889 --> 00:34:10,210
of this as well and again like if you if

966
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:12,609
you have a bigger estate and you do your

967
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:14,740
own vulnerability scanning like again

968
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:16,569
okay we've got four hundred and fifty

969
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:18,729
external systems and we scan them every

970
00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:20,529
day with necess let's pay pen testers

971
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:22,839
for a week to go and scan them all with

972
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:24,550
necess and why not just get them to

973
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:28,328
check that your nessus config is right

974
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:29,679
and maybe pick three and do a spot test

975
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:31,629
and if the answers come back the same

976
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,879
you're probably okay again it's like the

977
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:35,168
amount of money you can burn compared to

978
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:39,129
what you actually learn from that

979
00:34:35,168 --> 00:34:41,078
testing it's incredibly low and also I

980
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:43,179
would say this like testing should be

981
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,349
independent the amount of times I go to

982
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:46,418
a company and they're like right our

983
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:47,679
managed service provider fry T is X or

984
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:50,020
when they also sell a security

985
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,450
monitoring okay and there are pen tester

986
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:55,839
right so that contract may be worth like

987
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:58,390
low six figures to them if a junior pen

988
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,250
tester comes in and discovers a critical

989
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:02,470
vulnerability that is the result of

990
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,329
their IT services screwing up and their

991
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:06,250
managed security never detecting it

992
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:07,569
you really trust that that company is

993
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,040
going to be honest enough to front that

994
00:35:07,569 --> 00:35:11,020
up and not just say to that junior

995
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,058
tester know you're gonna wait 24 hours

996
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,440
we're gonna fix it you're gonna test it

997
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:16,480
again and that report will be clean

998
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,089
because my don't trust pen testers are

999
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,859
my life they need they are checks and

1000
00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:23,920
balances right if you outsource your IT

1001
00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:26,170
an outsource sock can be a check on your

1002
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,790
actual outsource to IT users right

1003
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:29,619
because they are your domain admins your

1004
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:30,880
desktop man-birds they are your they are

1005
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:32,799
the privileged accounts that you need to

1006
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,869
worry about so your sort can test those

1007
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:37,210
your pen testers can test that your IT

1008
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:37,440
Standards your IT hygiene is high but

1009
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,089
they

1010
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,260
can also test your sock can actually

1011
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:42,210
detect the things that they claim

1012
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,890
because surprise surprise if your

1013
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:46,050
pentester and your sock of the same

1014
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:47,910
company yet their sock can detect their

1015
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:50,010
pen test tools that is not surprising

1016
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:52,799
like if they card you've got some

1017
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:54,930
questions to answer like they claim that

1018
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,130
I have all this internal competition but

1019
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:58,348
think about this right

1020
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:00,750
you're a sock and you have a hundred

1021
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:03,150
customers sixty of which use that

1022
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:05,220
company for pen testing they get so much

1023
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:06,720
exposure to those pen testers of course

1024
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,368
they're going to detect them even if

1025
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,410
there is no internal like walk across

1026
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:12,650
inclusion they just have so much

1027
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:16,020
exposure to them it is not a valid test

1028
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:18,450
so really having independence in your

1029
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:22,470
testing of various sorts is critical I

1030
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:39,089
think here and I think we are done so if

1031
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:43,919
anyone has any questions I would like to

1032
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:45,779
take ISO 27001 and burn it I think it's

1033
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,420
good in theory but the way I see it

1034
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,710
implemented annoys me the amount of

1035
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,569
times I've gone into companies there is

1036
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,730
a literal dumpster fire and ITA state

1037
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:56,730
and they proudly show me their ISO 27001

1038
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:58,800
certification because for example the

1039
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:01,140
critical data is all held on this server

1040
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,740
and that server the scope is like a

1041
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:06,779
skinny jeans of like ISO 27001 that hugs

1042
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:09,390
that server and nothing else it's like

1043
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,950
okay but that server is administered by

1044
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:12,299
all these desktops over here that all

1045
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:15,960
have two main admin privileges on them

1046
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,700
yep but they're out of scope how are

1047
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,250
they out of like an attacker does not

1048
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,680
does not respect the boundaries that ISO

1049
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:25,140
27001 artificially carved your

1050
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:28,259
environment into and I understand in a

1051
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:31,410
large organization you can't test them

1052
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:34,170
like it's just there is it's too big but

1053
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:35,940
if it's too big to understand and test

1054
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:38,510
is it too big to secure that's where I

1055
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,319
kind of come down my worry is is that

1056
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:42,960
certifications are good but they have to

1057
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:44,790
be applied essentially along at the very

1058
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,390
least like the most likely sort of

1059
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:50,529
attack paths all the way through yeah

1060
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:52,900
how do you about

1061
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:57,150
a company how the skirt and you

1062
00:37:52,900 --> 00:38:02,110
knowingly this was knowingly that they

1063
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:04,200
redact this I mean this is not something

1064
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:07,270
that I really do I mean like I will

1065
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,710
typically avoid all ISO 27000 like they

1066
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:10,660
can tell me that ISO compliant and I'll

1067
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:12,310
read through their documentation I then

1068
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,750
pretty much ignore it for the purposes

1069
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:16,120
of any work I'm doing with them because

1070
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:18,910
if it matches up great and if it doesn't

1071
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,859
that's kind of the point of it there are

1072
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:24,549
some where I would question how you can

1073
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:26,740
be ISO 27001 compliant and in 2019 not

1074
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,240
do server patching claim to do monthly

1075
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,430
desktop patching could be six months

1076
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,649
behind because the latest Microsoft RDP

1077
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:36,009
patch broke all your RDP to your servers

1078
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:38,410
because they're not being patched and

1079
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:44,080
you're still running Server 2003 in a

1080
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:46,180
lot of places I mean again let's come

1081
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,950
back to the root cause of that is an

1082
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,750
incredibly poor technology management

1083
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,609
process for the last 20 years where they

1084
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,560
just don't care about IT they CIT is

1085
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,730
something that sits alongside the

1086
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,190
business and not something that

1087
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:59,710
fundamentally is a support for

1088
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:01,630
everything they do but yeah that is our

1089
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:04,510
question and again I work with small

1090
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,620
organizations so they sometimes come to

1091
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,540
me and say should you boo i say so in

1092
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:10,630
here and skill and my don't bother and

1093
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:11,740
cool we are done but I think people are

1094
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,970
probably wondering over so if you have

1095
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:16,649
any further questions I'll be around the

1096
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:16,649
corner in the bar so thank you very much
