00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:29,220
sorry anyone that well let's go straight

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:30,749
to the end so we all like dark roads uh

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:36,440
you know unless I have some light modes

8
00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:39,420
on the talk so let's turn it on right so

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,358
special mentions to few guys that helped

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:48,000
me out over the course of this time that

11
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:49,679
I've been doing this my name's Phil

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,530
Miller but anyone that doesn't really

13
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,300
know me I work for coming all day after

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,640
exploits we kind of do you know

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:03,300
responsible disclosure yeah regulation

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,600
the boring stuff I'm homeless I live out

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:13,020
of hotels it's pretty fun yeah kind of a

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:15,089
thing you do when you work remotely but

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,770
for the talk let's just remember I'm not

20
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,720
a lawyer I'm probably the last person

21
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,670
you want to talk to when you have this

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,210
much Jager you don't want to attack me

23
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,920
yeah representing you terrified young

24
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,979
but yeah but I'm not offering legal

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,870
advice I wouldn't go to AFF go to

26
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,490
lawyers go to people that actually know

27
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,220
what they're doing

28
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,470
yeah so let's go straight into it types

29
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,000
of disclosures so we've got responsible

30
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,780
disclosure we got coordinators closure

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,610
which similar very similar for

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,370
disclosure where you just kind of you

33
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,670
know throw it out there and hope that

34
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:52,650
you know things don't go wrong which

35
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:57,180
often times they do send what's this

36
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:58,650
caper partial disclosure where I've done

37
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,050
it a few times when you know people

38
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,390
aren't really listening the right people

39
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,580
aren't really kind of kind of

40
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,410
approaching you or you can't get a hold

41
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,840
of them and that's where you kind of

42
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,400
really give kind of a redacted version

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,950
of your disclosure be like okay well

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,290
this is an issue I can do there

45
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,480
and you kind of get them involved

46
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,819
because even certain will get involved

47
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,859
to be like this is a big problem someone

48
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,200
else will get involved and that's kind

49
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:31,230
of a good step forward their

50
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:32,280
non-disclosure zero-days a PT's the

51
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,470
things that you don't really want to

52
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:40,200
happen they often happen with some

53
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:44,940
disclosure responsive disclosure kind of

54
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:48,950
as I was going really yeah

55
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,950
just as things kind of happened with

56
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,840
yeah you approached the right people in

57
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,680
a sense so you kind of you know talking

58
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,519
to the appropriate you know vendors

59
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,690
organizations trying to get people

60
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,550
involved from our yeah kind of creative

61
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,459
dialogue where you're getting involved

62
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:11,660
in that sense and kind of giving them

63
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:15,150
what they need to patch those issues

64
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:17,850
full disclosure you know kind of doing

65
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,380
it without any you know warning kind of

66
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,410
going straight into it

67
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:25,049
kind of not really giving any kind of

68
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,880
precursor that hey I'm just gonna drop

69
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:29,250
this which kind of causes problems a lot

70
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,959
of companies I'm like that Google's good

71
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,120
fracks doing full disclosure because I

72
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,590
do it quite often nowadays and then you

73
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,019
know they go out I'll expand you know

74
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:42,720
nowadays we just gonna drop this man has

75
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,400
given notice it's really yeah there's no

76
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,390
way to patch it there's no way to kind

77
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,220
of do anything about it

78
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:50,488
and you know it's gonna cause a lot of

79
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,620
issues for the vendor farm people for

80
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:54,989
yourself even because if you kind of you

81
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,430
know give them you know this disclosure

82
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,350
which you're doing you know openly

83
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,120
there's gonna be a lot of issues in that

84
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,420
sense with you know Cisco's good example

85
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,430
a lot of companies they really please

86
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,859
just close you just thrown out at them

87
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,780
as like well all these corporate you

88
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,850
know kind of companies are just gonna go

89
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,930
down the wall because there's nobody to

90
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:18,959
really patch in time yeah for disclosure

91
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:21,418
right so moving on we go to the first

92
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,070
kind of case study in that where we

93
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:25,830
worked with a company called beer 52

94
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,810
which is based out of Edinburgh they

95
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,940
kind of provide beer because

96
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,100
hackers love bail and you know we kind

97
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,580
of need free beer so how do you free

98
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:40,020
them right so this is kind of example we

99
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:41,880
kind of go about yeah we found a few

100
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,440
different vulnerabilities and we're like

101
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,810
well you know how do you go about doing

102
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:50,340
that and we kind of emailed them to say

103
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:53,780
well yeah we found a few issues in your

104
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:56,280
company we'd like to go about you know

105
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,659
disclosing this jr. we understand that

106
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,820
you're not involved in a bug bounty

107
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,520
program and yeah

108
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,490
we'd like to kind of open a dialog kind

109
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,400
of create yeah this context of where we

110
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,500
can talk and yeah we often ask you know

111
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,679
can we have some swag can we have

112
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,690
something here a turn because we're kind

113
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,220
of doing this for free but at the same

114
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,440
time a lot of companies do understand

115
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,030
that yeah you don't for free but you

116
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,000
know we have a lot of swag laying around

117
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,619
we might as well give you some yeah give

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,110
you a t-shirt give you some stickers it

119
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,380
says you know we love it we love it all

120
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,940
so you know let's take it so you know

121
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,210
shortly after we were given a kind of

122
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,070
email where they were glad for it they

123
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,630
were like you know we understand those

124
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:43,320
issues we understand that we can't

125
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:45,900
really cover a thing and yeah tell us

126
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,990
what you have shortly after I was also

127
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,669
we had the C seed into this a developer

128
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,830
which kind of got involved into this and

129
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:54,990
we were able to directly talk to the

130
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:58,349
developer involved to kind of have that

131
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:02,490
issue or issues and you know get that

132
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:04,590
patch so as a result the actual I

133
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,970
believe he was a co-founder of their

134
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,159
futu

135
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:10,020
basically told us you know we can send

136
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,380
you a free few you know cases of free

137
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:15,380
beer and we're like damn I'm right

138
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,380
trigger

139
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,180
ESMA salt we kind of you know produced

140
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,710
some proof concepts because usually when

141
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,479
you provide a service you're kind of

142
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,659
giving more of a report when you're

143
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:28,370
disclosing to bugs you kind of not

144
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,290
really doing in a report style they're

145
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,020
not paying you to do a report i'll see

146
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,550
don't waste your time too much they have

147
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,440
all the time in the world and if they're

148
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:40,430
not paying you you might as well do it

149
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,229
in a yeah proper way but without wasting

150
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,930
too much time to kind of you know

151
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:48,200
constructor report on that sense so yeah

152
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:53,720
few proof concepts what it does all you

153
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:59,990
need really to kind of do that as was

154
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:02,450
old jason holla bill on the way we

155
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:05,090
actually got free bill so that was one

156
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:09,669
of the better kind of installments we

157
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,669
did know

158
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:16,100
so this yeah i put it to free kind of

159
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:17,870
principles to disclosure and you know

160
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,000
you got communication without

161
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,380
communication you don't really have

162
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,639
anything begin with and you're kind of

163
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,979
go in the wrong path because you're

164
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,539
gonna go to have an open disclosure or

165
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:28,669
you know you do something that's gonna

166
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:31,430
annoy them because they weren't warned

167
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:34,400
they won't talk to you it's not really a

168
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,830
good way to kind of engage with a vendor

169
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,679
or engage with a company

170
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,870
integrity that's a big one because you

171
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,870
want to kind of keep your integrity with

172
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:47,150
a you know disclosure because if you

173
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,490
kind of go this wrong way you know and

174
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,130
you're kind of going for some you know

175
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,570
hey what kind of asking for some staff

176
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,340
but asked for money or we're doing

177
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,110
something yeah it's kind of gonna kind

178
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,030
of seem as if you're doing something

179
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,139
maliciously and that's why you kind of

180
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,840
want to keep your integrity the whole

181
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:05,150
way forward even if you hey you can send

182
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,320
some money to another account that you

183
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,270
know you are keep your integrity there

184
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,370
where you can go well we didn't though

185
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,289
so that's why we're disclosing us and

186
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:17,330
that's really why you want integrity in

187
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:19,729
this transparency always have complete

188
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,039
logs of exactly what you've done every

189
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:25,729
network you've touched every subnet

190
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:27,469
everything so just in case it goes wrong

191
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:28,349
or even if it doesn't you want to be

192
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:29,610
able to go that come

193
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,190
I feel like you know we've done this

194
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,260
we've done that we've connected to these

195
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,419
networks we've you know attached to this

196
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,090
computer and this is what we've done and

197
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:41,460
you know when you're going for it they

198
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,560
really appreciate that because it makes

199
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,820
it easier for their job they can look at

200
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,040
you and logs and be like okay

201
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,380
bet your hosts them that's you know we

202
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,030
know what you've done cool yeah we

203
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,740
understand that you're just disclosing

204
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,420
it purposely and you're not actually

205
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,770
trying to be malicious you're not hiding

206
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:03,000
yourself through all these tunnels

207
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:05,939
moving on to AXA this is actually for a

208
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,940
kind of a developer for AXA which we

209
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:11,760
actually disclosed to and we actually

210
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,460
went about kind of the issue was the

211
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,430
company didn't actually have a proper

212
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,770
presence so we had to get a hold of

213
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:23,550
their clients which happened to be you

214
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:26,460
actually was one of them great team they

215
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:30,420
have their own search which is perfect

216
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:32,010
and yeah it's it helps us out a lot when

217
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,979
we can go to a client if you like hey

218
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,510
one of your developers is you know kind

219
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,400
of doing this and we'd like to get a

220
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,560
hold of them and that kind of helps us

221
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,400
you know reasonably disclose these

222
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,229
things to them so they got in touch with

223
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,720
the company which you know this year

224
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,490
actually come to contact with us and he

225
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,230
actually you know responded saying well

226
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:56,190
we understand there's a lot of problems

227
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:58,410
with our thing and you know we kind of

228
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:03,150
be interested in using user services so

229
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:05,040
that was a case we did there risks in

230
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:08,510
disclosure there's you know quite a few

231
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:12,890
risks when you disclosed legal threat

232
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,890
yeah pretty self-explanatory

233
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:19,830
which kind of results to you can sued a

234
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,330
half the time just legal threats half

235
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,340
the time you're gonna see a lawyer at

236
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,270
your door they're gonna kind of you know

237
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,600
knows either way in

238
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:29,970
depending on how yeah your exposure is

239
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,460
how deep he went into network what

240
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,899
you've really done and

241
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,910
how serious they say that kind of

242
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:36,320
implication if this see you know hey

243
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,540
clients are gonna be affected

244
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,149
hey client or stakeholders gonna say hey

245
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:44,510
yeah what's this they're gonna be

246
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:46,250
interested to kind of see you out of

247
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:49,550
talking because they will try that

248
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,330
they'll try every way that they can you

249
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,060
could go to jail

250
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:54,709
that is a very likely you know thing

251
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,969
that's gonna happen and a lot of people

252
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:57,260
didn't realize when they're going to you

253
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,790
know responsible disclosure or are they

254
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,939
going to kind of screw research that

255
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,930
there's a very good likelihood that you

256
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,740
may go to jail

257
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:08,260
because the CMA is pretty loose and

258
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,600
we'll get into that later

259
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:14,360
hey you can't go salted as I found out

260
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,120
once going to a trade show that after

261
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,209
talking to a vendor for so long and

262
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,620
we'll get to that one in a bit that you

263
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:23,270
can actually get assaulted by at the

264
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,910
vendor you're disclosing to because

265
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,740
sometimes they do not like you talking

266
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,420
about the incident and sometimes they do

267
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,500
not like when you talk about it on

268
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:35,180
Twitter but that's the yeah that's kind

269
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,520
of the risk you take and yeah we got a

270
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:40,609
great you know pendous kind of bingo

271
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,370
going from Pentos banners which kind of

272
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:46,459
you know kind of outlines exactly how

273
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:48,860
you know pen testers get hold their you

274
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:51,439
know crumbs are sometimes it's just hey

275
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,810
it was a feature you know it's as simple

276
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,970
as that and that's a real big issue for

277
00:11:53,810 --> 00:12:01,400
us because it's not a feature it's a

278
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:05,000
buck but so going on to the amazing

279
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:09,110
company that we you know had a bit of an

280
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,500
issue with kind of at the you know late

281
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:16,820
last year into the media we had a bit of

282
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:18,680
a kind of issue of a fender we actually

283
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,440
were in touch with FBI as a result

284
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,449
because of this very hitless we needed

285
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,140
to make sure that you know companies and

286
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:28,459
clients were aware that hey you're you

287
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,250
know vendors not doing anything about

288
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:33,680
this so we kind of need to make sure we

289
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:37,510
have a back-up plan in case someone

290
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:41,930
actually realizes what's gonna happen

291
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:44,430
long story short we spoke to the company

292
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:47,410
and yeah

293
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:50,109
kind of said you know while on occult

294
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,189
with FB honor we said well they said

295
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,380
we'd like to buy you out

296
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:57,070
and we ran okay but we do provide a

297
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:59,380
screen service and you know if you're

298
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,480
willing to we can provide reports and we

299
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,089
give you a ride up and yeah we're

300
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,399
estimating 140 hours so we kind of gave

301
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:10,000
them that fair go we gave them exactly

302
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,310
what we were going to provide and yeah

303
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,040
that's kind of how you normally go about

304
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:18,130
your business clients but in the sense

305
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,329
they actually seem to be agreeable and

306
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,850
went you know we're going to work for

307
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:23,589

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,019
you to delete anything that's you know

309
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:31,630
kind of incriminating for us or that's

310
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:35,019
gonna kind of make us look bad and it

311
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:38,589
took a you know quite a while into

312
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:40,600

00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:23,800
see yeah and yeah as anyone that's

329
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,050
actually rehearsing law or actually

330
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,579
knows lawyers you'd understand that

331
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,579
there's not actually a proper legal fret

332
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:32,138
it was just made is baseless but yeah

333
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:35,260
it's scary to most people it's like well

334
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:39,759
 yeah I need to lawyer up or I need

335
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:44,079
to do this nut I'm in trouble yeah so we

336
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:46,569
had a kind of nice kind of reply to them

337
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,430
which they weren't appreciative of and

338
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:50,979
they kind of went away so it's nice

339
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:53,769
there but yes it's away from resources

340
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:56,100
for also the researcher because we've

341
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:58,079
put months of our effort into it

342
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,819
we've got no return if anything we've

343
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,829
actually lost money on you know our

344
00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:07,339
lawyers on our kind of resources

345
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:10,529
everything no very long

346
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:13,560
so yeah reward says closure you know you

347
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:15,870
get some swag yes my maybe yeah maybe

348
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,930
it's public bug grab me amazing if it's

349
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,610
not you might not yeah you might just

350
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,739
kind of get thank you

351
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:25,079
and that's really what you expected this

352
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,910
kind of job when I was starting out like

353
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:28,920
nine out of ten companies who just say

354
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:31,649
well thank you for that yeah

355
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,930
wait small or yeah we just don't provide

356
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:35,579
this and that's the case with most

357
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,769
companies so it's you know it's pick and

358
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:39,689
choose and so kind of monopoly kind of

359
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:41,639
you know you're kind of gambling other

360
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:44,009
resolve that one company might want to

361
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,230
services or one company might one choose

362
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:48,120
you

363
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:50,759
legal issues there's quite a lovely

364
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,630
issues there but the main ones in sigmay

365
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:57,899
and Syria and the CFAA we won't really

366
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:59,939
go too much into but see may affects us

367
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,980
in the UK so we can go into that right

368
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:06,980
now

369
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:10,500
yeah so what is hacking and going to

370
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:14,730
yeah DK government's hacking is really

371
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,620
kind of not really a good term it's it's

372
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,839
really you know as long as you do

373
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,899
anything on like a PITA that's kind of I

374
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:25,139
will go into the actual act in a second

375
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:27,660
but really it's yeah a cheetah nature or

376
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:29,730
anything kind of unauthorized access in

377
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:33,300
pedo and they don't actually define a

378
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:35,100
computer properly and you know that can

379
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:39,269
be a serious issue because when you

380
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:42,360
don't define what a computer is you're

381
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:43,800
kind of looking at a technology he's

382
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,050
kind of done something that's out of

383
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,569
scope in the senses yeah you might have

384
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:51,839
just logged into a account that was

385
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:53,459
already logged in and yeah kind of you

386
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,610
know authenticated against the default

387
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:59,250
account and that's an issue so you know

388
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:02,160
as the Crown Prosecution Service will go

389
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,899
they'll go through quite a lot of the

390
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,889
law and they'll kind of consider you

391
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:09,290
know what fraud was a anything else in

392
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,750
their sense kind of you know

393
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:14,869
a little bit descriptive and that's kind

394
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:18,410
of an issue for us so computer misuse

395
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:20,149
Act really defines for kind of sections

396
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,579
is you know I don't has access to key

397
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:26,300
material and compute material is not

398
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:29,300
defined we don't define material self so

399
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:35,000
it's very broad and you know it could be

400
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:37,850
anything you know with intent and that's

401
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,560
a big one if he knew what you were doing

402
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,480
you're actually looking at a lot more

403
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,260
time than if he didn't if you were just

404
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,070
you know misusing computer once to use

405
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,320
kind of what they're looking at

406
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:50,389
prosecuting for and usually it's lapping

407
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,419
the rest when it's with intent you're

408
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:55,430
kind of looking a bit longer still

409
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:58,040
you're looking at the kind of high end

410
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,220
of two years so you're not too much into

411
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,159
it

412
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,630
but it's still pretty scary to think hey

413
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,810
I'm gonna get locked up for about a year

414
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:11,450
and do like he is you know time served

415
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:13,730
in that sense reckless plus you know it

416
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,830
could be I've destroyed data and that's

417
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:17,740
really was looking at is yeah I've

418
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,980
destroyed some data from the company

419
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,020
yeah

420
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,970
doesn't matter what the data is could

421
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,250
have been in a cache faster than

422
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,050
anything but you're looking at the

423
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:30,070
higher end of the scope which you know

424
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:33,889
we'll get into in a second

425
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:36,429
if you you know touch say a SCADA system

426
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:38,900
or anything that's you know kind of

427
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:40,460
controlling actual things like hospital

428
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:44,120
or something you're looking at you know

429
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,830
a lot of time so I'd kind of move away

430
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,979
from your phone safaris where you going

431
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:51,649
hey IFE system because some my offices

432
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,450
IOT systems actually you know effect the

433
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:55,760
real world and that's where you're gonna

434
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,560
look at some serious harm if you do

435
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,300
something wrong and you know sometimes

436
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,580
we like to you know press the on-off

437
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:04,580
button and see what happens but let's

438
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:08,120
kind of steer away from that and less we

439
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:10,850
know what it's actually doing so you

440
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,550
know you can be convicted for up to 14

441
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,469
years and that's kind of a serious

442
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:18,200
factor to realize when you're doing

443
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:20,620
anything relating to screw research if a

444
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,130
company doesn't know you know hey I'm

445
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:26,158
kind of just researching this

446
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:27,809
I'm looking into system oh it might be a

447
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:30,360
you know default gateway it might be

448
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:31,830
anything as soon as it says you know you

449
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,600
need to login or you need to be

450
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:39,029
authorized you look handsome trouble now

451
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,519
and then there's the even worse factor

452
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:43,529
when you're going into actual you know

453
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:45,389
damage of the network or damage of an

454
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:46,500
actually students wire from where you

455
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:48,389
know we're talking about you know SCADA

456
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,659
system easier you could access anything

457
00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:53,850
that's really serious in that nature and

458
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:54,779
that could actually result in life

459
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,980
behind bars

460
00:19:54,779 --> 00:20:00,659
so yeah the u.s. actually has quite a

461
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,980
nice the system in that sense because it

462
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:04,620
actually defines you out you you're

463
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,789
looking at ten years maximum twenty in

464
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,889
the sense of you know you're going to

465
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:11,759
serve some time but you're gonna be you

466
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:16,620
know watched that's where the survey

467
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:18,570
comes in and that's where yeah you have

468
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:21,658
to still know about it in the sense that

469
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:24,029
you know even though you're not in the

470
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:26,090
US and even though you probably don't

471
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:29,669
think you know you're gonna be kind of

472
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:32,009
pushed towards the you know US law as

473
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:35,100
long as that company has any stake hold

474
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:38,190
in the u.s. it has any stake holders in

475
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:41,039
the u.s. it has anyone that's remotely

476
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:43,710
involved in the US you have to be aware

477
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,379
of the CFAA because the survey they can

478
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:49,350
easily get you on as long as someone in

479
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:53,580
the company is from the US and that's

480
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:56,009
why yeah it's an operating us your

481
00:20:53,580 --> 00:21:00,029
bidding trouble does I've stakeholder so

482
00:20:56,009 --> 00:21:03,330
Phyllis you're in trouble you can be

483
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:05,700
extra and that's you know that's a nice

484
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:08,189
fact to know you can actually be tried

485
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:12,409
in the US and as you know something

486
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,409
whoops no yeah Marcus oceans

487
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,889
it's a step in the right direction we

488
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:19,799
are getting kind of used to this

489
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:22,529
yeah this is quite a new topic everyone

490
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:24,870
really think of ski research is this big

491
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:27,990
thing people think oh she research a

492
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:29,399
student here now I'm even yeah bug

493
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:31,799
bounties everything it everything

494
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:34,139
relating to security has a sense of like

495
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:36,330
InfoSec that the sense it's is still new

496
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:36,899
as much as it's been around for you know

497
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,510
ten

498
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:42,090
twenty years it's not really been in the

499
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,760
sense that we can close bugs to

500
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:47,370
companies because a lot of companies

501
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,020
back then you could go hey I've got a

502
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:52,199
problem and they weren't really looking

503
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:54,600
into it in that sense so you know we've

504

engage with companies to kind of build a

508
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,559
bug bounty program and they've actually

509
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:09,570
done this by doing yeah they've got

510

you disclose if it's you know it's

566
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:47,070
something serious look at going to cert

567
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:48,540
look at the e FF look at legislative

568
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:51,860
organizations which you know would

569
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:54,320
include so for example or yeah NCIC

570
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:56,939
anyone who's gonna really kind of be

571
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,419
helpful as we've done in the past we've

572
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:03,000
got involved because we believe you know

573
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:05,070
kind of people who are wise needed in

574
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,540
that sense that yeah if this was a risk

575
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:09,090
factor of you know critical or some

576
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:11,040
sense how do we kind of mitigate this

577
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:13,020
and you know you kind of want to make

578
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,550
people aware of this so you want to go

579
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:19,110
to the right kind of organizations that

580
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:20,580
sense if you've done something wrong and

581
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:23,550
you know as long as it's sort of our

582
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:25,080
ability you know potentially talk to zff

583
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:27,720
they're very helpful

584
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,550
they'll give you advice potentially look

585
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,350
at kind of a safe harbor program you

586
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:33,480
know which kind of you know protects you

587
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:35,070
in some sense to kind of if you don't

588
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,260
give that information out but without

589
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:40,439
you know any recognition of yourself or

590
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:44,760
you know kind of mitigate your own risk

591
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:49,050
as well and yeah that's kind of a little

592
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:51,300
bit into how we do through research and

593
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:54,270
how screw so it can be good and can be

594
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,980
bad there's no right way to do it and

595
00:25:54,270 --> 00:26:02,240
we're still learning and you know that's

596
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:02,240
the way to go forward no thank you

597
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:10,390
[Applause]

598
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:24,690
so I started my first network engineer I

599
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:27,360
found out that I prefer you know the

600
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:29,580
streets other things I actually broke

601
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,639
into my school systems when I was

602
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:35,279
younger as a result I actually found

603
00:26:32,639 --> 00:26:36,840
like I was like hey you know they're

604
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,029
rewarding it's like attaboy kind of

605
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,158
thing and it's interesting that that was

606
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:43,200
an attaboy because nowadays it's not and

607
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:45,929
that's kind of where you know problem

608
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,549
now but I kind of felt well thanks

609
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:50,039
everyone's kind of rewarding in that

610
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:52,710
sense so I kind of moved to hey what if

611
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:55,110
I break into big systems so I learned

612
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:58,830
that it's not all attaboy

613
00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:01,080
but in the end they will you know reward

614
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:04,139
you if they see necessary and so I

615
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:06,360
fought well it's still a good community

616
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:08,428
if you're involved in InfoSec it's

617
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,539
amazing community as we are all here

618
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:14,190
you know InfoSec is a great thing but

619
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:16,710
the corporate size not as good as we

620
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:19,399
think but it's getting there and that's

621
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:22,470
why as we progress as the years go on

622
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:24,719
yeah we're gonna get to a deploy to

623
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:53,909
everyone but as long as you follow the

624
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:59,490
rules and regulations as is safe so what

625
00:27:53,909 --> 00:28:02,309
your people for example screw

626
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:09,630
sandbox escape it's kind of way to do it

627
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:11,760
yeah purposely releasing disclosures so

628
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:14,879
you think they go to harm kai I'm not

629
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,670
sure that's their purpose but it is in

630
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:19,110
that sense I

631
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:22,630
it's I don't feel that house you know

632
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:24,399
tabatha has done it is kind of

633
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:26,470
responsible I don't feel that they've

634
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,360
done it it's kind of better the

635
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:30,970
community I feel that they've done it

636
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,790
because I can and I feel that yeah of

637
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:36,550
course harm you're doing it maliciously

638
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:38,440
in that sense and as much as they might

639
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:40,990
not think they've done it in that way

640
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,400
and as I think I'm a few people few I'm

641
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:44,260
not gonna mention their names but a few

642
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,300
come in of people have actually said

643
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,460
well yeah they're going for a lot or

644
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,379
something it's still not a way to you

645
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,110
know disclose something even if you

646
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,570
think hey yeah I'm going for a lot I'm

647
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:57,340
you know stressed or anything I'm just

648
00:28:55,570 --> 00:29:00,700
gonna release these it's there's no

649
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:02,620
excuse to how you go about it's you know

650
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:06,040
just closing anything you have to do it

651
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:09,100
responsibly regardless as long as you've

652
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:10,450
mentioned to that company and if they've

653
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:14,020
ignored you after a year or something

654
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:15,880
Shawn look at disclosing yeah we go you

655
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,889
know often we go one ninety days is a

656
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,870
good time to kind of respond to this

657
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:21,730
focus and I still think you still want

658
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:23,379
to give them some advance warning even

659
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:24,790
as you go you want to go off tonight as

660
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,280
we go well I'll give you a month now

661
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:29,500
I've got it ready here's the pages are

662
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:31,930
they yeah if you can't patch that in

663
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,870
time wrong time or something give them

664
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:38,410
advance warning again that yeah after

665
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:40,449
they elapse of time hey this is an issue

666
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,670
if you're just going straight out well

667
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:45,250
yeah you're breaking some laws making a

668
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:48,070
lot of issues there's gonna cause a lot

669
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:50,410
of havoc in the FSA community luckily we

670
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:52,750
all follow Texas care phone we can go

671
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:55,750
well a lot of these are kind of useless

672
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:57,340
they do have some nice ones but a lot of

673
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,500
them you know they're not going to be

674
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:04,260
relevant that yeah if it's something

675
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,260
else it can be same as a troubling issue

676
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,969
[Music]

677
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:21,340
frameless Microsoft that'll only have so

678
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:26,170
needed and they still thanks to release

679
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:29,580
thanks i I feel when it's a bigger

680
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:31,350
company there is actually as I've worked

681
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:34,710
I understand that there's a lot to go

682
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:36,209
through it's not just that they can't do

683
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,399
it at 90 days they can't do at 90 days

684
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:42,419
it's just that it's it's troubling in

685
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:44,789
that sense that hey yeah we're a big

686
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:47,549
company we can't just go after a bug

687
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:50,010
every day so we have to kind of create

688
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:51,720
this timeline and a lot of you know

689
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:53,730
people like Microsoft for example they

690
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,830
have actually different people who don't

691
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:57,690
actually work at the same time working

692
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:59,610
on the same project so they're not all

693
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:02,789
involved in that same thing but they are

694
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:04,320
involved in how to fix it so yeah I

695
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:07,169
believe you know you kind of have to

696
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,700
give them more than 90 days and I think

697
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:10,980
we're just learning how to do it the

698
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:14,100
still so even though we've said 90 days

699
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:15,539
is acceptable we've kind of learned that

700
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,070
and I think by now we've actually

701
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:18,990
learned that 90 days is still not

702
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:30,470
acceptable we probably should look at

703
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:30,470
longer times just like Randall oh yeah

704
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:40,560
[Music]

705
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:51,389
this is here at a brokerage house no

706
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:53,428
sense I've dealt with over the past you

707
00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:55,500
know dealing a zero days it's will be

708
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:57,090
dangerous now he's actually so most

709
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,130
people actually sighs away from doing

710
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,779
that just because you know you kind of

711
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:07,350
evolved to nation-states and stuff now

712
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:09,600
and it's just you don't want it but you

713
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:12,090
say that but it's you know see seller

714
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:16,439
you know Microsoft zero day for you know

715
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:20,279
main office your day so East European

716
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,809
company country and you're looking

717
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:24,299
Stuart I mean yes it's five figures

718
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:26,010
still it's not it's not too much if you

719
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:27,840
were to disclose out responsibly you

720
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,860
probably get yeah maybe a little bit

721
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,289
left but at least you get the

722
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,820
recognition and you can actually say

723
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:34,590
you've done that because we've you

724
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:37,470
really want to say hey I've disclosed to

725
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:39,000
a nation of state probably not and you

726
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,710
know can you look at your safe you know

727
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,070
you look at yourself to say way knowing

728
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:44,530
that you know you're Terry's line

729
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:46,090
hacked because well we know what apts do

730
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,740
we know what people do when they're you

731
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:49,179
know involved from that kind of sense we

732
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,790
know what's gonna happen with those zero

733
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:54,820
days do you really want to be a spear

734
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:57,280
researcher who wants to disclose yeah to

735
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:59,189
governments they have their own you know

736
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,180
departments they have thrown you know

737
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:03,430
professionals and you know they have

738
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:05,440
loads of your days the issue is do you

739
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:08,860
want to you know kind of you know add to

740
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:34,870
that probably not so it comes back to

741
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:36,370
integrity in that sense that's the first

742
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:40,600
thing thing to say because I believe

743
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:42,699
it's a bit of your it is again you do

744
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,740
that a bit because I believe when I do

745
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,290
it I look at the company itself

746
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:49,150
I look what that what they do I look at

747
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:52,180
their kind of founders and you know

748
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:54,010
their age range I go well then you to it

749
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,840
you know they're a small company that

750
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:58,450
startup or you know they're a big

751
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,270
company but they're young guys old guys

752
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:03,550
I go I kind of build that kind of you

753
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:05,560
know reverb I I do for fun I come you

754
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:07,899
know my clients in that sense but I

755
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,690
think I will still send an email to

756
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,310
every single company that I finally just

757
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,960
go to work because I will just go well

758
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,600
you know you still have this issue

759
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,580
it's how I go about closing it to them I

760
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,529
think that's you kind of build a

761
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,540
template around what that company does

762
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:25,000
and you have to kind of profile that

763
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:27,340
company and then go I'm gonna do it in

764
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,340
this way because you want to make them

765
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:32,920
aware in the safest way there you go

766
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,970
well they're gonna read this you know

767
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,670
they're they're 30

768
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:38,139
or they're 50 and you want to go it well

769
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:40,060
they're gonna look at this and be like

770
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:42,190
oh yeah these guys are nice chest

771
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,210
they're not like they're not gonna you

772
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,590
know they don't ask you for money

773
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:47,590
they're not doing anything where you

774
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:49,090
know they feel intimidated by that sense

775
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:51,370
you don't wanna make your clients are

776
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:52,139
intimidated and that's kind of the way

777
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:54,909
to do it

778
00:34:52,139 --> 00:35:10,300
[Music]

779
00:34:54,909 --> 00:35:12,460
have the answers that question so we

780
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,930
actually in-house we use a in terms for

781
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,750
which we've developed which kind of

782
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:19,029
scans most of our your hunters and

783
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:20,800
they're kind of quite like shown but we

784
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:23,440
kind of do it in a sense where we have

785
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,050
two different services and our kind of

786
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,210
palos how we go about payloads and we

787
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,940
kind of get a nice list of companies so

788
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:32,410
we kind of go from those and we kind of

789
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,930
it might take a year before we get to

790
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:37,480
them but it depends on the priority you

791
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:41,890
know what kind of issue it is and we go

792
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:44,980
from there but for anyone that's going

793
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:46,540
involved in it I think yeah just pick a

794
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,530
company but pick a company that's

795
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,450
probably involved in a bug bounty

796
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:52,060
because a bug Valley is gonna be you

797
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:53,710
know the best way to do it because when

798
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:56,140
you're going like us you're kind of

799
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:58,420
looking for them to get you as a service

800
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:59,830
so it's actually better if you go you

801
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,020
know to a pea size or something and you

802
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:04,450
go network with a company and go well oh

803
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:06,340
yeah we can provide the service it's

804
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:08,379
probably not good to do what we do where

805
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,880
you just open email kind of like kind

806
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:13,210
like a like you're and scare and that's

807
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,920
okay just like hey we found this can you

808
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:18,010
wire us that money but it's not in that

809
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:20,830
sense it's yeah it's much nicer but it's

810
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:23,080
more yeah we can provide the service

811
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:25,270
if not we can give you our basic package

812
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,520
it's kind of more of a sales tactic

813
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:29,650
where we have this package but we can

814
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:33,270
defeat dispatch and that's kind of the

815
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:33,270
way that we kind of aim to do it
