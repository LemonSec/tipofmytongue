1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,710
there - here and what we're now doing in

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,889
terms of sharing up thinking with

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:11,540
everybody else before I get started

4
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:12,860
you're very welcome to photograph the

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,268
slides if you want to move for your own

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,219
reference or share with colleagues or

7
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:18,200
share of social media that's great and

8
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,060
if you do share on social media please

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,250
tag in CSC down there as well as the

10
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,348
conference hashtag and we might retweet

11
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,110
retweet you if you've been sufficiently

12
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:28,669
complimentary about my presentation but

13
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,790
obviously don't let that influence your

14
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:33,230
thinking in any way you've probably

15
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,910
thought we are in Jelani art which means

16
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,190
please don't take photos of me or

17
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,890
particularly don't take photos of me on

18
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,690
social media and all my upset people

19
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,950
will get upset I don't like to upset the

20
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,629
upset people because they're lovely they

21
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,920
don't deserve to be upset so very

22
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:51,140
grateful for your help please in not

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,490
upsetting them so to start with if

24
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,650
you're not intimately familiar with what

25
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,030
the NCSC does or our mission here is

26
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,769
what we're here for we're here to help

27
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,900
with the UK the world safe space little

28
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:02,180
Mike online and we do our work under

29
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,769
these four main headings I think we

30
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,000
those four main headings are a bit out

31
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,500
of date now I think we express it

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,570
differently but I like these ones better

33
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,180
than the current version so I can stick

34
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,190
with these and understanding the risk

35
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,280
reducing the risk responding to instance

36
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,720
and nurturing capability so the work I'm

37
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,280
going to describe today was carried out

38
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,679
under that first heading the understand

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,510
the environment heading which covers

40
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,320
quite a bit of a specialist in technical

41
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:29,570
research winner NTSC and so to start

42
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,940
telling the story first let's move back

43
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,679
in time about eight years before we

44
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,380
started working in earnest on people

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,560
security but in CSG as it was then

46
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,929
so if you went back those eight years in

47
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,549
time and asked CSG what do I need to

48
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,159
know about people in security how should

49
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:49,400
I treat people as part of security what

50
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,350
kind of answer might you have got mine

51
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,750
included some of these these words and

52
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,520
phrases here these are all phrases that

53
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,540
used to be like very common the default

54
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,729
when you're talking about people in

55
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,320
cyber security and that's still fairly

56
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:03,049
common now more common than I would like

57
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,630
personally but we're starting to be were

58
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:07,280
thinking on it's great this is all stuff

59
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,889
that is what we used to say ourselves in

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,510
CSG eight years or so ago because at the

61
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:13,418
time we were just that was the place

62
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,130
that we were in like many other people

63
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:18,500
under before that was

64
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,760
this one big phrase the phrase that's so

65
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,240
big and so threatening I have to write

66
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,980
it in red in a very scary font it's the

67
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,200
assumption but it's so common so

68
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,670
widespread you still hear a lot now I

69
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,320
think a lot of people don't you realize

70
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,959
that it is just an assumption quite a

71
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,790
faulty one at that it's just taken to be

72
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:39,980
a universal truth for things sometimes I

73
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:43,640
don't think that's true so why why do so

74
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:47,030
many people think this and my theory is

75
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,649
that it's because the leaning thinking

76
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,680
in cybersecurity because for so long

77
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,090
been dominated by technology and

78
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,350
technologists technologies are great

79
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,780
don't get me wrong we certainly need

80
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,519
them inside security but no one can be

81
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,990
expert at everything and if you're a

82
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,630
deep expert in technology you're

83
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,160
probably not a deep x13 people and we

84
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:06,170
need deep experts in people in

85
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:11,600
cybersecurity as much as we need experts

86
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:12,679
in technology just pop up is really

87
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,910
annoying and it's stopping me getting

88
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:19,070
down some of my notes you're gonna miss

89
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:20,359
out on my Hana Harry's so I'm a dog um

90
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,190
this is sort of picking up some points

91
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,400
from Chris's talk this is keynote

92
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,960
earlier and that we a lot of such things

93
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,310
in security are a bit broken and we need

94
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,950
to really look at how we do some stuff

95
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,120
and do it better and I was thinking that

96
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,799
listening to Chris talk he knows about

97
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,540
this much is getting me going on now

98
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,640
he's nicked my picture saying everything

99
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,470
that I was gonna say but a much bigger

100
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,059
part of me going I know this is fine

101
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,800
it's actually really good if you

102
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,960
increase it on the same page that is a

103
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:50,300
good thing and hopefully more people

104
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:52,700
will be persuaded as a result so what

105
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,590
happened when we in CSG started to look

106
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,320
outside security from this more human

107
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:59,900
centric perspective what started to

108
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,579
change well it wasn't long before we

109
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,370
realized how disastrously wrong

110
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,870
this phrase IP really is so there's an

111
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,850
example lots of people have heard if our

112
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,230
password guidance I'm very proud that I

113
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,530
was part of the team that wrote and

114
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,940
published this back in 2015 so now it's

115
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,050
kind of a mini case study I'll walk

116
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,670
through some of what we learned about

117
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:19,910
passwords when we started to look at

118
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:21,530
them this people-centered way so here

119
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,150
are the old-school password rules you

120
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:25,789
know them as well as I do here as a fed

121
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,560
up with them as I am if you follow all

122
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,090
of these rules you will end up with what

123
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,190
is common

124
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,409
thought of as a good password or a

125
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:35,650
strong password using those particular

126
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,570
words name you using this process to

127
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,849
construct one password that you use

128
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:42,430
regularly most people to do that that's

129
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:45,190
okay and not everybody instantly but

130
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,110
most people if you use it to make per

131
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,570
say six or seven passwords again you

132
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,460
lose regularly most people can manage

133
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,280
that they are smaller them proportion of

134
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,198
people but make people cancel or do that

135
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,388
but most of us don't only need six or

136
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,610
seven passwords we're now appoint roles

137
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,050
people have dozens or even hundreds of

138
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,479
passwords that we're using loads of

139
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,850
places at work in a home and we might

140
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,500
not use them daily or even weekly and

141
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,389
that really affects our ability to

142
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,060
memorize them longer term to keep them

143
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:14,350
current in memory so this approach when

144
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,940
you stop looking at it from the point if

145
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,780
it's a person you'll have 100 accounts

146
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,889
it's really not that reasonable at all

147
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,869
so it's not only the password you have

148
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:24,340
to remember yeah it's also the user name

149
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,020
on what account it belongs to so that's

150
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,549
three sort of separate pieces of linked

151
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,690
information with a lot of data

152
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:34,210
potentially so when Cormac Curley whose

153
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,710
mother needs the sons this is what he

154
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:38,200
came up with about sort of the impact on

155
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,419
the user of asking them to remember 100

156
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,120
passwords usernames accounts we pass

157
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:44,740
through certainly these criteria it's

158
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,190
like memorizing piety to thirteen

159
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:50,320
hundred and sixty old places whenever I

160
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,639
say this I go and I bet nobody in this

161
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,900
room could really do that and then

162
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,150
occasion I give this presentation to

163
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,500
GCHQ I don't have to remember not to say

164
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,729
that because it's probably stuff doesn't

165
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,190
leak in the audience who stand up and

166
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:02,469
start reciting this life's numbers and I

167
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,250
think you'll agree most people can not

168
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:07,060
do this

169
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,970
just calm and if it weren't hard enough

170
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,310
just memorizing that number up there

171
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,780
it's not a static one-off memory task

172
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,919
it's not just remember that number there

173
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,750
it's remembering a number that's

174
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:18,520
possibly changing because we're

175
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,680
constantly picking up new accounts and

176
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,539
dropping old ones every so often we have

177
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,280
to forget we forget our password Smith

178
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:25,419
to reset them or we find out they've

179
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,299
been in their day to breach show you how

180
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:30,400
to reset them or sometimes we are forced

181
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:34,289
to change our passwords periodically for

182
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,760
no particular reason except security

183
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:38,320
there is a oh I've looked into this and

184
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,669
there is no particularly good reason to

185
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,729
think that rotating passwords regularly

186
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:43,308
makes us any

187
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:45,289
secur overall it's just a sort of thing

188
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:46,819
that intuitively makes sense you know

189
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:48,378
when your password refresher password

190
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:49,999
it's got to be a you know possible that

191
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,889
the attack is much like to have right so

192
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:53,210
it's probably better only it doesn't

193
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:55,520
actually work that way when you look

194
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,680
into the evidence nevertheless this

195
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,628
regular password expiry policies it were

196
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,969
the most ridiculously sticky security

197
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:03,439
policies around it's very very hard to

198
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:04,998
get people to let go of it I'm still

199
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,610
working on it it's kind of Grand

200
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:09,830
Challenge

201
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:12,229
so this is where common password

202
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,878
policies really start to fall down and I

203
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:15,800
would argue it's a good sign of where

204
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:17,779
common security education awareness

205
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,909
training policies pulled them more

206
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:21,558
broadly because you're kind of ending up

207
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:23,779
telling people you've got to memorize

208
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:25,699
all this stuff right you can't write it

209
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:27,499
down that's not allowed

210
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:29,599
you can't do anything else to make life

211
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:31,759
easier for yourself you really must not

212
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,349
reuse passwords between accounts you

213
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,639
mustn't use predictable password

214
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:36,438
generation patterns that someone else

215
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,089
will be able to guess you can't do any

216
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,460
of that and if we catch you doing it

217
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:43,219
you're in big trouble how do most people

218
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,438
react to that they tend to start

219
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:47,419
disengaging because they recognize that

220
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,310
this is an impossible task they can't do

221
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:51,049
that and yet that is what they've been

222
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,789
asked to do and that's a really

223
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,249
dangerous point because when people

224
00:07:52,789 --> 00:08:00,560
start that disengagement then it's quite

225
00:07:55,249 --> 00:08:02,330
hard to stop getting back again even

226
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,099
before that though I wonder how we got

227
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,849
to a place where were asking people to

228
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:09,259
do something this impossible routinely

229
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:10,849
and the answer I guess of course is that

230
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:12,919
no one ever actually decide to flee

231
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:14,539
decided to because this problem didn't

232
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:17,149
appear all at once it's growing over the

233
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:18,800
past what a couple of decades as sort of

234
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:20,120
online services have become more

235
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,499
widespread we've got more and more

236
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,370
accounts this problem just sort of crept

237
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:27,499
up on us and so past produce rose and

238
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,089
rose all that time and I think we were a

239
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:30,289
bit slow to realize that the world was

240
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:33,169
changing it that way and that we needed

241
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:34,669
a decently differently but it's not

242
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:36,260
completely excuses I think we thought

243
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:38,299
we've missed a lot of opportunities that

244
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,360
we could have taken to support memory

245
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:42,468
these problems over the years because if

246
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,839
you're asking people to do this

247
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:46,550
impossible password stuff what tends to

248
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,440
happen what kind of things can you see

249
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:51,260
any organization that tells you see

250
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,080
isn't working oh I forgot the rest of

251
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,110
the other dramatic bit

252
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,839
as well as being like remember izing pi2

253
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:01,080
3260 or places it's like memorizing 17

254
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,370
decks of cards all shuffled together and

255
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,899
you know another way of expressing how

256
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:09,430
completely impossible this is for most

257
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:11,079
people so what goes wrong how to use rap

258
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,969
to these impossible parser policies

259
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:14,979
again it's stuff that you will all

260
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:18,399
recognize it's stuff we know many people

261
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,410
do it's definitely doing myself even now

262
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,089
you know which I think just proves it's

263
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,219
not a question of Education or

264
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:25,990
motivation or taking security seriously

265
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,430
or anything like that because I've got

266
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,680
all of that now this is actually what I

267
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,510
do for a living and yet I'm human and if

268
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,469
I needed to do some of this stuff to get

269
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:37,060
through the day then I am going to do it

270
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,440
so and we know that we all know these

271
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,359
things you know these things happen

272
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,839
so when we spot them why don't we react

273
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,490
more constructively always why don't we

274
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,290
say hang on a minute huge numbers of

275
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,000
people are breaking our password policy

276
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,339
maybe that means we need to look at the

277
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,980
password policy we don't tend to do that

278
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:55,630
why don't we do that I think it's

279
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,220
because we've already internalized this

280
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:00,130
idea that people are the weakest link in

281
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,990
security no matter what so when you

282
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,640
notice people doing this stuff the

283
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:06,160
temptation is just stopped it done so

284
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,600
human weakness you know security is

285
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,829
always going to be able because people

286
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,959
just can't do what they need to do

287
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:12,959
nothing you can do about that just well

288
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,250
you know people going to people like and

289
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,779
that's the real problem because it stops

290
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,940
us looking into question any further

291
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:22,209
which might give us a chance of actually

292
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:24,220
coming out with better answers also it

293
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:26,050
kind of fuels the vicious cycle you know

294
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,480
the password policy stays the same

295
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:30,250
people keep breaking it which piles up

296
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,260
more and more evidence for the fact that

297
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,510
people are the weakest link and actually

298
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,699
it's more that we've been set up to fail

299
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:41,620
at a task that was always always

300
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:44,020
impossible for us so this is like a bit

301
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,610
of pretty bad place to being really more

302
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,930
importantly how do we start moving out

303
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,240
of this bad place how do we stop doing

304
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,910
better so now I'm going to run through

305
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,410
seven things that we in the MCFC have

306
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,660
learned about people during the course

307
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,279
of our research the past eight years how

308
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,579
these limbs and what we think and what

309
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:03,550
we now say to our customers first of all

310
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:05,949
people are the stupid this comes with a

311
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:08,889
caveat right mostly mostly people

312
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:11,320
stupid you do meet the occasional person

313
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:14,649
at work is like how are you here yeah

314
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,110
very large people are not stupid however

315
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:19,180
sometimes everybody does things that

316
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,250
look a bit daft from the point of view

317
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,630
of a security professional you look at

318
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,160
what they've got how on earth did you

319
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:26,079
make that decision how did you decide

320
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,300
that was the right thing to do but

321
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,040
actually more often when you dig into it

322
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,990
you try and understand where they are

323
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,490
their perspective what they know what

324
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,680
the assumptions they're making and what

325
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,300
they're trying to achieve you can kind

326
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,769
of see the line you can see where they

327
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,920
thought what they did was a reasonable

328
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:43,149
thing to do they've thought about what

329
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,649
they're doing they're doing it for

330
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:46,870
reasons that make sense to them

331
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:48,519
you may still disagree that what they

332
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,440
did was the right thing to do but it's

333
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:52,959
not fair to label it stupid just because

334
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,130
it's not what you would do it's this

335
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,229
perspective saying again you know

336
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,180
everyone everyone is pretty smart

337
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,529
biological what they do but no one can

338
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,199
be smarter everything and no one could

339
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:04,120
be an expert on everything security

340
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:05,949
people aren't experts on everybody

341
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,380
else's jobs and the organizations they

342
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:09,579
work for any more than all of the people

343
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,260
and organizations are going to be

344
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:13,870
experts in the security very much as you

345
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,880
might want them to be so to understand

346
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,980
why and how people do their jobs we have

347
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,540
to talk to them engage find out how they

348
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,709
see things so that we can then

349
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,880
understand why they're doing what

350
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:25,300
they're doing and what they're trying to

351
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,370
achieve you may be wondering why I think

352
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,870
this matters that much I think it really

353
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,640
does matter it matters because if we

354
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,079
start thinking of people is stupid we

355
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,779
start treating them as if they're stupid

356
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,510
and then that sort of alienation process

357
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:38,439
follows we start thinking things like oh

358
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,970
well if people aren't following the

359
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,260
security rules maybe they're so stupid

360
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,060
they don't even know what the security

361
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,439
rules are well maybe we'd better tell

362
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,640
them the security rules again and then

363
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,070
that'll solve our problems with people

364
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,339
not following the security rules only

365
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:52,930
incredibly it doesn't work like that

366
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:55,089
most of the time our research is showing

367
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,439
people do know what the security rules

368
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:57,550
are they probably don't know them off

369
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,380
the top of their head because they tend

370
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,969
to be quite a long and complicated but

371
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,380
they may be important stuff they know

372
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,060
where to find the rules they even know

373
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,399
who to ask if they aren't sure they want

374
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,829
reassurance if people aren't following

375
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,300
the security rules it's more likely that

376
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:13,300
that's because these rules don't work

377
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,769
for them in some way so throwing the

378
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,109
rules of them again just really doesn't

379
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:18,840
help it only makes them further it's a

380
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,810
visible demonstration that we

381
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,070
know who they are we don't know what's

382
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,280
important to them we don't know how

383
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,690
things look from where they stand in and

384
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,100
maybe we don't even care that much about

385
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,680
what they're trying to achieve you know

386
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,480
if it appears to them if we don't care

387
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,800
about what they're trying to do why are

388
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,970
they going to care about the security

389
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:41,459
rules that we can get important next

390
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,750
thing people want to be secure this is

391
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,520
the traditionally the point Roman six

392
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,280
back and goes oh I'm not sure other ones

393
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,990
not remember one again because people

394
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,839
sometimes act in a way the makers think

395
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:56,130
the places that the motivations on being

396
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:57,270
secure I think if they do care they just

397
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:02,220
don't always carrying the same ways that

398
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:04,199
we care and the thing about so they they

399
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,790
care but it's not always that easy to

400
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,910
transform that caring into positive

401
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,800
action that supports security goals so

402
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,420
research gives us a quite good idea of

403
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,120
how much effort people are prepared to

404
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,660
put into doing security well and the

405
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,880
answer

406
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,980
most people will put reasonable efforts

407
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,230
into following security rules that make

408
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:25,020
sense to them which they're able to

409
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:27,480
follow critical point and which support

410
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:30,990
them in achieving their prime models at

411
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,760
work however their definition of what is

412
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,490
reasonable efforts put into security

413
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:38,100
might differ from ours and their primary

414
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,810
goals usually differ as well primary

415
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,280
goals as security professionals is to

416
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:44,160
enable the business by securing a

417
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,449
business and Jesus primary goals it's a

418
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,829
bit simpler than that the main the

419
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,000
primary goal is always to get their job

420
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,670
done whatever the job is in the

421
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,720
organization being secure you know the

422
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,459
digital care about it but it's the

423
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,460
secondary goal underneath that primary

424
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,630
goal in an ideal world the primary goals

425
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,070
and second your goals would be fully

426
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,390
aligned you know and you could do

427
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,310
security in a way that supports you

428
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,990
getting your job done but in practice

429
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:11,010
these goals aren't usually completely

430
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:12,840
aligned because it's hard right next one

431
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,780
people are busy isn't everyone busy I

432
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,820
know I am everyone's busy we often want

433
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,400
people to spend more time and efforts on

434
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,830
security but most people don't feel they

435
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,630
can easily do that usually they're

436
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,760
pretty fully occupied during their day

437
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,230
jobs like I said it's kind of about

438
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,430
goals of motivation a lot of the time

439
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,170
people's day jobs have been more

440
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,849
important to them you know on a day to

441
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,529
day basis

442
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:37,649
so there's a question of motivation and

443
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:39,240
reward as well if you don't do the tasks

444
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:41,850
that your boss really cares about you

445
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,100
doing you can be pretty sure that that's

446
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,149
not gonna end well for you that they're

447
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,410
going to notice they're gonna pull you

448
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:48,990
up begin to get in trouble as me some

449
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:51,630
sort of sanction with security tasks

450
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:53,339
that's a lot less certain because partly

451
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,230
because I sort of the immediacy isn't

452
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:58,680
there the consequences are something you

453
00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:00,839
do on often immediately obvious security

454
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,508
tells people not to do all sorts of

455
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,670
things because security we don't always

456
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:07,319
explain why in enough detail I don't

457
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,120
think and also there's this immediate

458
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:11,550
you see problems so people learn from

459
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,199
experience that you can actually do a

460
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,449
lot of the stuff that security tells you

461
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:19,279
not to do and the sky will not fall in

462
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:21,180
straight away so use a weak password

463
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,189
probably nothing but I haven't was

464
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,859
stopping any important happening we use

465
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:28,170
a password from somewhere else you know

466
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,430
so nobody might ever find out if you

467
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,819
click straight through a pop-up warning

468
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:34,380
on your laptop from experience two and a

469
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:35,819
half years of having this laptop nothing

470
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,560
bad has ever appeared to happen when I

471
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:39,319
flick through that warning so why would

472
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,550
I take the warning seriously

473
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:42,719
well if you let someone in the office

474
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,829
behind you even though they haven't got

475
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,300
their badge on you know they've got the

476
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:47,758
hands full you want to be helpful you

477
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,130
know all these things that security or

478
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,899
Draghi you didn't do people are

479
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,819
motivated to do all of those things all

480
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:55,889
of those things work for people on some

481
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:57,509
level so just telling them not to do

482
00:16:55,889 --> 00:17:00,240
those things because security doesn't

483
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:03,209
work breaking the password rules makes

484
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,500
life manageable clicking through pop-ups

485
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:05,990
lets you get on with your work your

486
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,130
important conference presentation

487
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,359
letting someone in the office behind you

488
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,250
lets them get on with their work and

489
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,979
it's helpful right it's supports

490
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,569
teamwork teamwork and cooperation with

491
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,730
social animals we get stuff done as

492
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:19,349
teams you know none of us are gonna last

493
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,760
long at work if we don't look out for

494
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:23,520
each other the organizations although

495
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:27,209
the last long collective success depends

496
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,070
on working together productively there's

497
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:30,750
also a bit of a problem it has sometimes

498
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,330
we seek to get people's attention on

499
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,860
security stuff people are really really

500
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,928
good at paying attention to things that

501
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,309
help post things are important and we

502
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:40,409
are increasingly good ignoring stuff

503
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:42,030
that we think doesn't help us we kind of

504
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:43,919
have to be good at this it's a survival

505
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:46,000
tactic no we live in a world where we're

506
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,150
constantly bombarded with all

507
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,990
information promotes most places

508
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,880
security is just one of those many

509
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,130
things that demand our attention day to

510
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,240
day and from many people's point of view

511
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,970
it just doesn't deliver those

512
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,429
commensurate rewards right now so I

513
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,780
think for securities to succeed really

514
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:03,880
we need to get a bit more picky about

515
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,408
what we ask people to do and when we

516
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,539
seek to grab their attention to take

517
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:09,150
them away from those primary tasks we

518
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:12,400
need to make sure it's really worthwhile

519
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:14,110
so be a bit pickier about what's really

520
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,789
essential and what's nice to have and

521
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,289
would be great but actually it's going

522
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:19,480
to take some energy so is it really

523
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:21,250
worth it you know if we focus on the

524
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,630
smallest possible set of essential stuff

525
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,700
and far more likely people will actually

526
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:28,090
find it achievable and actually going to

527
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,980
do it so this is a lot of sort of stuff

528
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,539
in defense of people you might be

529
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,860
thinking oh no people can't do anything

530
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:35,169
wrong from this woman's point of view

531
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,899
but let's sort of talk about that a

532
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:39,429
little bit more people make mistakes of

533
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,070
course we take we're all human we all

534
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:44,380
make mistakes we get things wrong we

535
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,629
miss stuff we're driven by our emotions

536
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,330
at least as much as we're driven by our

537
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:51,070
intellect we rely on cognitive biases

538
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,059
and heuristics which you know again

539
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,490
they've evolved they're there for a

540
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:56,020
reason they helpful they help us a lot

541
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,240
of the time but all the time sometimes

542
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,620
they make us get stuff wrong and it's

543
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,120
important to understand that you know

544
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,100
look a bit more closely at when people

545
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,080
make mistakes and what's actually gone

546
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,059
wrong so that we can understand the

547
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,408
underlying causes which really happen

548
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:10,178
and if we understand the underlying

549
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:13,510
causes we're much better place then to

550
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:15,309
find better answers so if a whole lot of

551
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,658
different people are making the same

552
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:18,668
kind of mistakes again and again

553
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:21,159
probably doesn't really indicate much

554
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:22,480
about those people it mainly means that

555
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:25,360
the thing that they're using isn't very

556
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,409
well designed for people but we've

557
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,850
already seen how this works with

558
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:29,500
passwords you know there's a very common

559
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:32,168
set of workarounds that you see every

560
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,909
single workplace that you have go it's

561
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:35,409
not a sign that passwords are working

562
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:37,480
perfectly in humans and especially

563
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:38,770
failing at it the design that the

564
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,360
passwords aren't working very well for

565
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:43,389
the people and therefore the passwords

566
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,039
aren't working I have some time to think

567
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,419
this about organizations you've got we

568
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,400
need your Kony and approaches to people

569
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:50,320
who fall for phishing emails a day some

570
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,970
places have disciplinary measures for

571
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,439
people who click too many backlinks you

572
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:55,539
can even get sacked for clicking too

573
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,070
many bad links I do wonder if they

574
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:59,629
thought this through you know because

575
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,010
the logical ending point of that process

576
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,660
is that your organization will have

577
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:04,760
hired and fired everybody in the entire

578
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,049
world and however you have left will

579
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,879
still be clicking badly it's because you

580
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:10,220
can't train people not to take bad links

581
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,960
we've proved it with science however

582
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:14,120
hard we tried we will not stop all

583
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,650
mistakes happening but we can cut out a

584
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,449
lot of the nucleus and the stakes you

585
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,100
might say by talking to people about

586
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,650
what they need and how they work and

587
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,850
giving them tools that work for them

588
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:24,380
right I'm slightly nearer the end of the

589
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:26,480
talk than I thought I was going to be at

590
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,910
this point so I might if you try and cut

591
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,830
a few bits out let's see all right this

592
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,570
is a paint not to spend too much time on

593
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,820
people did nothing sometimes on purpose

594
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:36,289
of course today this is not really the

595
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,240
subject of this talk I'm talking about

596
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:40,309
user behavior at population levels and

597
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,960
at population levels and most people are

598
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:45,710
trying to do the right thing most of the

599
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,809
time so what's the most important thing

600
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:50,140
to say I had three important things to

601
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:52,580
say I just say one of them I think and

602
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,100
I'll hear hone in on signal-to-noise

603
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,750
ratio you know if we do this stuff I've

604
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,189
suggested around making it easier for

605
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,380
the people who are well-intentioned to

606
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,090
do things right it's a lot easier to

607
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,260
spot the people who are setting out to

608
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,730
do wrong because you have all those

609
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:08,658
false positives to wade through that

610
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:10,100
sort of main point of that punishment

611
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:11,809
doesn't drive positive oh hey Lee it's

612
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,389
already talked about sucking people for

613
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:16,250
clicking finish fishing lakes and we've

614
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,480
got mountains of Criminology research

615
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,250
that tell us that the sort of

616
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,890
relationship between behavior and

617
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:24,409
choices and sanctions it's nonlinear

618
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:26,360
it's not obvious you know it's not as

619
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:27,950
simple as in still penalties and then

620
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,719
but behavior won't happen it just isn't

621
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,250
you know otherwise the countries that

622
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,659
have the death penalty for serious crime

623
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:36,080
that have hardly any serious crime and

624
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:37,789
that's not really the case this sort of

625
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,439
proach assumes that people are rational

626
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:41,960
actors and that we always act in our

627
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,679
best interests and that's not how people

628
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,679
work at all

629
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:50,960
you have things the way they split

630
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,549
approach actively does harm is if people

631
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,900
are trying to do the right things and

632
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:56,270
you punish them because they've managed

633
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,799
to do the wrong thing then it doesn't

634
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:59,289
actually make them any easier make it

635
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:01,668
any easier for them to do things right

636
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:04,158
they'll be motivated to avoid the

637
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:05,360
punishment in future sure but if you

638
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,880
don't give them a viable alternative

639
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,918
route to reach their legitimate goal

640
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,380
then let stuck between a rock and a hard

641
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,610
place you can either stop doing this

642
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,350
it's getting even punished which you

643
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,699
might think great well what the fat

644
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,080
thing was actually really useful for the

645
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,050
business what if it was supporting

646
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,520
business goals or they can keep doing

647
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,770
the thing but they'll try harder to make

648
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,629
sure that you never find out again if

649
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:28,310
your instant numbers might go down might

650
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,510
look like a good thing but not really if

651
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,399
you've just driven that behavior

652
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:33,410
underground if it's happening but you

653
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,970
don't know it's happening you can't you

654
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,880
can't manage it come on a trick you

655
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:40,330
can't do the risk it's not good things

656
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:43,160
makes it a bigger problem

657
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:45,110
finally a lot of people's future kind of

658
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,510
stuff focuses on awareness awareness as

659
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:49,669
an end goal and making people more aware

660
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,070
of the threats more aware of the risks

661
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,390
and occasionally they get around to what

662
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,860
are you supposed to do about the threats

663
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:57,050
and the risks but we don't really didn't

664
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,550
go that far the problem is awareness

665
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:01,340
doesn't look or action you know there's

666
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:03,710
a lot of steps between the two and it's

667
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,330
not an easy thing to achieve I'm going

668
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,950
to go to this but I just randomly pulled

669
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,409
this model off each day it's one of many

670
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,090
models that are available and just to

671
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,920
illustrate the point that there is a lot

672
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,020
of stuff that needs to happen after

673
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,870
awareness before you get to sustained

674
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,160
behavioral change this is kind of

675
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:21,409
something that we all know in daily life

676
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,870
you know who knows how many fruit and

677
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:26,210
veg you're supposed to meet your dates

678
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:28,790
hands up anybody Oh a couple of people

679
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,780
president I think both excellent okay so

680
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:32,110
everyone knows you're supposed to eat

681
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:35,180
five free edge a day or patiently seven

682
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:37,459
we always do that we all know smokings

683
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,810
bad for us some people's make anyway we

684
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,400
know that speed limits are there to keep

685
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:42,860
us safe that sometimes we still speed

686
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,910
it's not an awareness problem we know

687
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,800
all this stuff and we've made a

688
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:49,040
different decision anyway or sometimes

689
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,600
not an active decision so it's

690
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:54,050
complicated turning awareness into

691
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,399
positive action right so this is the

692
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,080
summary of the guiding principles we've

693
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,150
learned about people the past eight

694
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,740
years and this hopefully gives you the

695
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,780
insight into our thinking on people's

696
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,280
security so now I have to move on so

697
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,930
there all right I'm vaguely convinced

698
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,420
but what do I do differently bits and

699
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:10,160
I've got five minutes left so awesome I

700
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:13,340
actually may be flown in five minutes

701
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,750
but trying to punch you so the first

702
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,429
important thing and I think I've gone on

703
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,980
about it a bit already listen and learn

704
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:21,290
and understand good security isn't

705
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:23,240
achieved by just imposing our own ideas

706
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:25,580
of how security should work in our

707
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,210
organization it's about that too you way

708
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,439
engagement

709
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,670
listening and respecting how other

710
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,160
people say things and what they're

711
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:33,750
trying to achieve at work then helping

712
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,550
them to do that in ways that we can live

713
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:38,010
with ways that may not perhaps be

714
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:39,810
totally ideal MA point if you but is it

715
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:41,460
good enough does it get the job done

716
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:44,070
does it allows us to manage risks

717
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,720
alright if so can we never there okay

718
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:48,330
let's move on there's always more to

719
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,920
deal with we have to recognize that

720
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:51,780
people are the experts on their own jobs

721
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,820
just like we're the experts on security

722
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:56,250
and the right answers we'll all be the

723
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,250
one that respects their job goals as

724
00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:00,270
much as it respects our security goals

725
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,620
you can engage with people in lazy

726
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:03,060
different ways I've trapped a few ideas

727
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,889
up there because people always want

728
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:06,270
ideas where to start but really it

729
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,250
doesn't matter what you do it's how you

730
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:11,160
do it

731
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:12,810
so signaling trust and openness this is

732
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,220
one of those sort of softer skills that

733
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,600
I don't like to call soft skills because

734
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,480
they're actually really hard core

735
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,610
business skills is a term I prefer so

736
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,800
show people that we listening show them

737
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:24,659
that it's safe to talk to us get out

738
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,360
there engage on their terms build trust

739
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:28,940
build rapport do all of that and try and

740
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,350
have a productive conversation with them

741
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,510
don't forget people quite often start in

742
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,980
a bad place here you know they might

743
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:37,350
have experience of trying to talk to

744
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,030
security people before and even maybe

745
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,649
getting brushed off or even coming away

746
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,820
with some sort of sanction because

747
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,080
you've gone and said like I had to do

748
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,070
this thing I know it's not really in the

749
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,449
rules but I was trying to be the right

750
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,220
thing can you help me do it better and

751
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:49,500
security god no oh how you did the wrong

752
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,000
thing breach you know I think I have

753
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,700
tons less less these days I certainly

754
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,130
hope so but it's not not impossible

755
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,260
reaction so we have to do everything we

756
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:00,000
can really to talk to persuade people to

757
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,290
talk obviously to us because if we

758
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,220
aren't having honest conversations we're

759
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:06,480
not going to find out the right stuff

760
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:08,640
and make it be better and reflect back

761
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,200
this is a really simple little technique

762
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,420
that I learned doing counseling training

763
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,400
actually but it's astonishingly helpful

764
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,990
in that rapport building thing as well

765
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,720
as on making sure that you have really

766
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,860
understood what some of this said to you

767
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,960
so it can be as simple as just saying

768
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:24,479
okay this is what I heard you just say

769
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,150
this is what I think it means is that

770
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,740
right the key bit being is that right

771
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,940
give them a further opportunity to go to

772
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,680
oh yeah that's emotionally right but

773
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,940
there's this thing there or now actually

774
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,340
you've got totally wrong able to stick

775
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,440
is that thing there so it's part of that

776
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,580
actually signaling that you're engaged

777
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,799
with the person that you're told

778
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,240
do you really want to understand their

779
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:45,690
perspective and you really want to help

780
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,820
make things better find the underlying

781
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:49,950
causes the security problems really

782
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,139
important look beyond the superficial

783
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:54,570
behaviors and figure out what might be

784
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,279
driving them which as you said might not

785
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:57,658
be what you think you know you might

786
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:59,640
have to get underneath your assumptions

787
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:01,620
find out more about how other people are

788
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,760
approaching stuff what they know the

789
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,340
things you know that they don't know

790
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,799
figure out all of that and try and

791
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,840
trying to get things right when I say

792
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:11,279
underlying causes people always go oh

793
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,949
yeah root cause I know all about root

794
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,419
cause I haven't got time for the full

795
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,490
root cause Rand which is quite shame

796
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:19,830
because it's a good one but a few very

797
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,630
causes is there is plural there's never

798
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:23,760
a single root cause there's never a

799
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:26,549
single thing you can point at to say

800
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,620
this is why this thing went wrong this

801
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:30,960
is I think easy to explain if you flip

802
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,610
it and ask for you know people to think

803
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,139
about something that went right there's

804
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,029
conference for instance mall here today

805
00:27:34,139 --> 00:27:38,219
what was the root course of this

806
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:39,630
conference working what was a single

807
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,940
thing we can point to this the reason

808
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:43,710
why it works those they're single thing

809
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,450
there's motive things latest things all

810
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:47,279
have to come together and line up to get

811
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,809
us all here to make sure we had rooms

812
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,700
and lighting power and food and all that

813
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:51,960
stuff and it's just the same when you're

814
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,700
trying to look for a single root cause

815
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,110
for why something went wrong it's never

816
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:59,130
that it's always an alignment is enough

817
00:27:55,110 --> 00:28:00,029
things that went wrong and you know

818
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,110
that's the only way it's the positive

819
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:02,880
thing because it means there's always

820
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:04,529
more than one chance to stop a bad thing

821
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,409
happening it will stop having a real bad

822
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:09,330
effect and like we often say if your

823
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:11,429
entire system can get owned because one

824
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,658
person clicked on a bad link it's not

825
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:13,740
the fault of the person who clicked the

826
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:15,419
bad links because you've got a lot of

827
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:19,440
opportunities to stop that doing damage

828
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:20,940
and evidence-based decisions then Chris

829
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,370
talks about this quite well earlier so

830
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,740
trying to be brief we don't always

831
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:28,408
collect the right data insecurity we

832
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,000
don't collect enough of it we collect it

833
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:31,380
for different reasons like proving to

834
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,289
the board that we do something something

835
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:36,059
you're good this book's mean like

836
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:38,100
fishing simulation training packages

837
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:40,049
they're quite an easy low resource way

838
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,480
to do something to generate some data

839
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:44,549
you can easily show the click rates go

840
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,929
down over time I think it's all great

841
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:47,639
looked like it's working well

842
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:49,480
something's working but it might not be

843
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:51,860
the thing you

844
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,410
you may have been able to train people

845
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,729
in a sort of short-term way to support

846
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:57,740
your fishing training links and not

847
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,419
click on them doesn't actually correlate

848
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,620
with any decrease likelihood of clicking

849
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:02,900
on other kinds of fishing links that

850
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:05,659
look different so it's not the same not

851
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:08,179
the things think right precisely five

852
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,780
minutes left let's oh this is an

853
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:11,120
important one

854
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:13,129
budget people's time and efforts quite

855
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,199
fundamental change in approach familias

856
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,910
because we used to thinking of people as

857
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,220
this sort of relatively malleable

858
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:21,260
resource with loads of capacity to grow

859
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,940
and change and do these things and of

860
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,010
course people can't do that and people

861
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:28,480
are among it amazingly adaptive and

862
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:30,650
innovative but we can't do everything so

863
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,500
we have to focus our effort on things

864
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:35,000
that really mask to us so we have to get

865
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,770
in security get used to thinking of

866
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,140
people's time and effort as a resource

867
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:40,820
like any other kind of resource and then

868
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:42,140
enhance that call the compliance project

869
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,820
which I really recommend going reading

870
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:46,130
about it puts in quite good quite good

871
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,600
terms but basically like any other kind

872
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,770
of budget you know it's valuable and if

873
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,600
you spend it somewhere you can't spend

874
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,770
anywhere else and if you prove to have

875
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,320
spent it all and all the thing less

876
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:55,580
wasted you putting it back so thinking

877
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,178
about people's time and effort in those

878
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:00,860
terms I find you really helped fixing

879
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:03,049
the environment not people have sort of

880
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:04,969
some lawyers talked a lot about this I

881
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:06,530
think already and we always tend to

882
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,270
default to trying to fix people because

883
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:10,100
they look like the thing in the system

884
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,418
that did something wrong or the thing in

885
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,370
the system that's easiest to deal with

886
00:30:11,419 --> 00:30:16,820
and easy to change and neither of those

887
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:18,678
things certain can really true people

888
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:21,409
tend to while people in my circles

889
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:23,150
anyway tend to go to baby change as the

890
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:25,940
quick and easy fix for anything that's

891
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:28,360
wrong and it's not quick it's not easy

892
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:31,580
and it only has marginal effects really

893
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,229
if your intervention delivers like a 15

894
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,790
percent change in behaviour in the

895
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,210
desired direction that's a really good

896
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,250
result

897
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:39,309
no but there's still another 85 percent

898
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:41,929
to worry about some direct thing and

899
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:43,970
it's quite difficult to translate any

900
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:48,230
short-term success into longer-term

901
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:50,299
sustained behavior and learn from what

902
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:53,929
we've learned why I'll show you this

903
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:55,790
really quickly and we need to do we

904
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:56,780
quite often do single loop learning for

905
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,428
like on the right-hand side of the

906
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:00,149
picture we figure out what the problem

907
00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:01,680
was we decide how to solve it

908
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,450
we solve it we move on to the next

909
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,580
problem but the double-loop learning

910
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,740
there is about introducing a bit of

911
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,480
reflection on how we solve the problem

912
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,460
and what we learned maybe what

913
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,780
assumptions we made to start with and

914
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,670
how we need to carry that thinking

915
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:22,320
forward into whatever we do next

916
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:23,730
ah next right so this is the summary

917
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,250
list of things I think we should start

918
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:28,650
doing differently to really help people

919
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:31,800
help help make our people the best

920
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:32,790
assets to security that they can do in

921
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,500
the last couple years in particular

922
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,600
we're hearing more and more stories of

923
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,280
where people are doing this stuff doing

924
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,780
it really well having great effects

925
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,280
we're trying to calculate as many of

926
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,320
these as we can to case studies on the

927
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,090
NCSC website because we love to prove

928
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,950
success and we love to prove we'd love

929
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:49,830
to show real world implementations of

930
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:51,060
the approaches that we suggest so it's

931
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:54,210
it's good I think it's going in the

932
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:56,129
right direction we need more of it I've

933
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:58,230
got a very very quick list of sort of

934
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:01,050
evidence some of the major academic

935
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:02,520
sources that have gone once a day if you

936
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,629
only have time for one read users are

937
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,070
not the enemy that's where it all

938
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:08,760
started it's great

939
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:10,290
oh god I gets highlights this is very

940
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,000
interesting this is just like a proof

941
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:13,409
that yeah we've have produced a lot of

942
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,900
guidance based on the principles that

943
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:17,640
I've talked about today and we like to

944
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,230
think it is pretty good you can go read

945
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,850
it on the intensity website and later to

946
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:22,830
know what you think via the inquiry

947
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:26,699
service or treatise will come to us on

948
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:28,590
LinkedIn or in vanilla right and that's

949
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:35,340
it so much have we got time for any

950
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:38,600
questions or feeling weak with velocity

951
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:42,929
area straight out the door right right

952
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:45,649
is there anyone present Oh contrary

953
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:48,709
thank you very much

954
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,709
[Applause]
