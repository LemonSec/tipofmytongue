1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,540
thank you to you 20 odd people that

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:11,490
stuck around to listen I wasn't

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:18,420
expecting a large crowd at the end of

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:21,689
the day I'm going to close with a bit of

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:27,060
a rant hopefully not too angry old man

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:29,550
style you're not gonna learn much really

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,628
my intention is just to say some things

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,310
and get you to think about some things

9
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:37,320
my views are mine don't represent my

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:41,520
employer necessarily but they do

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:46,350
slightly I hope everyone's had a good

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:49,950
besides I obviously hadn't seen the

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,930
talks when I wrote this talk but luckily

14
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,180
it kind of fits anyway I've attended

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,860
quite a few and the theme throughout the

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:01,170
two days has kind of played well into

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:04,078
this anyway a lot of the talks that I've

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:07,189
seen here all good stuff lots of clever

19
00:01:04,078 --> 00:01:10,169
people doing smart things sharing ideas

20
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:12,148
very you know that wisdom is being

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,749
imparted on a lot of you in a lot of

22
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:17,759
different ways the car hacking

23
00:01:14,749 --> 00:01:20,119
lock-picking teaching how to fuzz all

24
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,999
the things pen test the stuff defense

25
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:26,999
offense etc etc stuff on hacking careers

26
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:29,520
building businesses it's all genuine

27
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:31,649
good stuff so I'm not gonna rip into it

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,649
I'm not gonna say it's bad stuff it just

29
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:37,950
kind of plays into what I had to talk

30
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:39,929
about today which is kind of this what

31
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,490
has happened to this industry was

32
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:43,859
reflecting quite accurately and a lot of

33
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,649
the talks that have been given and it's

34
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:51,839
all stuff for cyber warriors and digital

35
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:53,609
soldiers besides is awesome all of the

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,529
b-sides all of these events when I got

37
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:57,119
started there was no conferences at all

38
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:59,609
so the fact that there are so many

39
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:04,499
conferences now that have spun up in the

40
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:06,270
UK were people are sharing all the time

41
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:09,538
passing information around teaching

42
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,070
people new things is awesome but back in

43
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:14,890
the day we kind of had to roll our own

44
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:16,870
and I was part of a small group called

45
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:20,380
we had a little conference where people

46
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,660
got drunk did crazy things said ideas

47
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,950
and it was all about just having fun

48
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,260
together and we all work for different

49
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,179
competitors there was no egos in the

50
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,660
room there was nothing about your big

51
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,370
branded slides and things today the

52
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,640
world's changed it's very very very

53
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,709
different on it's all cyber it's all

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,119
serious stuff and all about being big

55
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:46,810
business and okay fair enough but it's

56
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,420
it's become a career rather than a job

57
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:52,570
which is weird for some even describe it

58
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,670
as a calling it's all got really

59
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,980
grown-up and super serious I've been

60
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,619
around for about 10 15 20 years doing

61
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,390
this stuff and it's more in the last

62
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,290
three four or five years where it's

63
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,809
really shifted and all again reiterating

64
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,910
all the talks and everything was great

65
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,250
but I want to close the event by

66
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,079
basically just reminding people to have

67
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,150
a little bit more fun with the stuff and

68
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,700
stop being so hardcore in serious and

69
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:22,840
taking yourselves and it so seriously

70
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:25,570
it shouldn't all be work and no play so

71
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,980
I've worked at two notable firms in my

72
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,750
time of words and a lot of places but

73
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,709
these are the most you know all a

74
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,480
company called

75
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,660
at stake and a company called end of

76
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,780
your art and people that I work with at

77
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:40,840
these firms are just awesome crazy

78
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,430
bastards and play with anything and hack

79
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,489
anything and do it for shits and giggles

80
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:48,250
and it does turn into marketing and it

81
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:50,530
does turn into talks at various

82
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,209
conferences and yes services fall out

83
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,170
and we make money but that's not why

84
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:55,239
anyone did it

85
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:58,988
we didn't go and do these things to

86
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:03,489
solve cyber or to save the world it was

87
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:05,440
for fun couple of prime examples here

88
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:08,320
some how can we did on pause and pause

89
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,540
devices we modified them so we could

90
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,090
play video games on them and wrote the

91
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,340
day to write the games to load on there

92
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,108
and play longer than doing the research

93
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,060
and finding the bugs and weaponizing an

94
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:20,798
exploit

95
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,650
no one said no don't do that because

96
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,419
people were having fun doing it and

97
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,400
people just do stuff because they can

98
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:28,340
and they've got the freedom to do it no

99
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,260
restrictions

100
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,000
constraints on what they choose to

101
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,730
research now is having a conversation

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,530
with one of the vendors over there about

103
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,180
their education program I suppose if we

104
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,969
asked a question about how they are

105
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,650
teaching people to do research and the

106
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:46,669
way that they are doing is by handing

107
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:49,099
over a doctor methodology prescription

108
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:50,330
research and then giving it to people

109
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,880
and saying that's how you do research

110
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:55,909
and then products and services and money

111
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,050
fallout boards the shit at me and you're

112
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,590
not going to get good stuff out of that

113
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:02,270
you're just gonna get formulaic stuff

114
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:05,060
put someone in a room with a bunch get

115
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,039
stuff to play with and just let them get

116
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,139
on with it set fire to it burn it melt

117
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,180
whatever happens something good might

118
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:13,040
happen something bad my app but it

119
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,500
doesn't matter you just keep doing that

120
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,530
and just have fun more so I love I owe a

121
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,000
lot of people at and we are and at stake

122
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,320
a lot because they're the ones that

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,289
brought me up and I grew up with that

124
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,300
and that carries on to the people I work

125
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:30,110
with and the teams that I run and the

126
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,270
people I teach doesn't but why did this

127
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,010
happen why did this industry get so

128
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,250
grown-up and super serious all of a

129
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:39,010
sudden and it's for valid reasons

130
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,840
globally we are losing trillions

131
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,950
trillions of dollars pounds whatever

132
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,599
currency you want to put on it and

133
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,760
that's increasing each year from

134
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:48,500
cybercrime so it's a very real problem

135
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,039
that does need something doing about it

136
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm not belittling that the UK

137
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:57,409
specifically is losing billions every

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,130
year also now all that money's flowing

139
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:04,820
out imagine if we had a corruption free

140
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:07,010
government country where that money

141
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,840
wasn't flowing out and it was staying

142
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:11,180
here all the good things that could be

143
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,179
done with it so it's it is important but

144
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,979
it is big business for criminals and the

145
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,850
economy pays a hefty price price so it

146
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:19,650
is serious stuff

147
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:22,380
but it's also a big business for

148
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:25,650
industry too now I work for consultancy

149
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:29,159
was further along here but I still put

150
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:32,310
myself in the same camp if all of the

151
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:36,990
companies countries economies are losing

152
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:38,640
so much money these guys are making a

153
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,770
lot of money out of it as well and they

154
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,229
pay taxes so really no one talks about

155
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:47,039
how much is it really will losing versus

156
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:48,090
the industry that's cracked up you know

157
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,010
whether its products whether it's

158
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:53,159
consultancy whether it's sales it's all

159
00:06:50,010 --> 00:07:00,530
about making as much money from this

160
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:03,270
stuff as possible when crest launched in

161
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:05,039
2006 there was three or four companies

162
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,109
on the list rubber stamped as being a

163
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:10,350
plus plus would do business with again

164
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:13,110
whatever there's over 150 therms now

165
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:14,730
worldwide that are accredited rubber

166
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,490
stamps is the best to go and get you

167
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:20,790
security from and crest itself is a

168
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:23,550
not-for-profit organization it doesn't

169
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,750
mean they don't get paid everyone pays

170
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,520
their membership fees so there's

171
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:30,780
business in rubber stamping people to do

172
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:34,229
business there's also a massive skills

173
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:37,830
gap that's legit we're told all the time

174
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:39,660
that we need more cyber people more more

175
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:42,930
people with more skills to solve all

176
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:45,120
these problems there's not enough of us

177
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:49,230
to do all these things apparently so

178
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,760
that's genuine and legit as well the UK

179
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:54,380
government have even made it a top

180
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,730
priority to build more cyber people

181
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,530
however I've seen this in lots of

182
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,420
different industries where someone

183
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:03,179
decides there aren't enough people so we

184
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:05,990
go and build people the motives aren't

185
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:09,480
always the tourists so engineering

186
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,920
construction nursing it same happened in

187
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,750
those industries there weren't enough

188
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,000
people but what that really meant was

189
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,340
because it was a scarce resource you had

190
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,920
to pay a lot of money for it so if you

191
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,330
over populate the industry with more and

192
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,910
more people and stop it being so scarce

193
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,830
you can pay less so it's really about

194
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,910
driving the cost of it down so again it

195
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,030
comes back to business

196
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:31,620
I just wouldn't assume that everyone

197
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,209
that's shouting about the skill

198
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,230
and we need to build more and more he's

199
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:39,150
doing it with the truest of intentions

200
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:42,060
it also obviously being a good citizen

201
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:44,550
and saving the world and being a digital

202
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:46,520
cyber warrior isn't enough for you then

203
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,770
there's shit tons of cash to be made you

204
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,720
can launch a cyber security company you

205
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,520
can be a cyber security Warrior you can

206
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,370
get paid the big bucks by the flashy

207
00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:00,449
pars go on all expense trips to Vegas

208
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:04,470
and party etc it's just this constant

209
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:07,440
temptation of internet fame and fortune

210
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,960
if you come in cyber the financial

211
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,610
rewards for uniquely talented people and

212
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:16,320
all the rest of it oh great there's also

213
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,970
plenty of recruiters out there that are

214
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,860
willing to tell you the same and dangle

215
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,320
big wads of cash at you every time you

216
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,180
land at a different company just

217
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:29,160
personal view there I think they're all

218
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:31,050
snakes I decide not I guess like some of

219
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,339
you already enrolled some of you are

220
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,010
looking for roles some of you were

221
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:37,020
studying etc everyone's telling you is a

222
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,180
massive skill shortage you're a scarce

223
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,310
resource why would you need to pay a

224
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,380
fixer to find you an employer there's a

225
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,760
whole bunch of desks over there we

226
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,510
people ask you need to go and work for

227
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:50,520
them the internet people know how to do

228
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,620
Osen but can't figure out where to get a

229
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,939
job you've got to pay these guys and

230
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:59,100
yeah you do pay them because they take a

231
00:09:53,940 --> 00:10:00,510
cut of your future earnings demand is

232
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,750
outstripping supply you don't need to

233
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,370
pay someone to find you a role so it's

234
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,580
super super attractive now to come and

235
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,990
work in cyber whether you know it's

236
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,280
recruiters trying to attract you it's

237
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,050
various different consultants he's

238
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,660
telling you how exciting it's gonna be

239
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:18,150
how challenging how your special

240
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:22,050
talented little unicorn and you the only

241
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:23,910
one that can do this stuff but that's

242
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,380
not enough now we need to build the

243
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:28,350
people in the shape that we want them to

244
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,780
so we break from it now put out a little

245
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:33,750
trail from school to college to

246
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,790
university to whatever little trail of

247
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,450
do this then do this do this do this do

248
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,949
this so you can get you to be a cyber

249
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:45,530
just make it more accessible to get the

250
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:49,850
skills we've also got

251
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:52,420
education curriculum so again about

252
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,890
further refining people into this mold

253
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,959
we're still in a university that isn't

254
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:58,730
lost on me where there is cybersecurity

255
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,170
courses but it's the same across the

256
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,090
land lots of different cybersecurity

257
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:06,650
courses all called something different

258
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:08,870
but again it's about building this next

259
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:13,040
step along you take from school to

260
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:16,610
college to university cyber courses

261
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,170
galore and then we've got the industry

262
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,470
roadmaps that get put out so the likes

263
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:23,449
of crest and sands that again tell you

264
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,130
more learning is necessary do this

265
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:27,980
course get this badge get this

266
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:30,939
certificate and all it's doing is

267
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,770
producing more and more cloned

268
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:39,770
individual cyber warrior cyber soldier

269
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:42,410
ninja whatever all factory produced for

270
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:46,340
the roles that apparently we need to

271
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:48,560
solve cyber and defend whatever and but

272
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,050
it's just to me it's all geared up just

273
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:57,439
to flood the market with templated

274
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:59,719
people the cyber factories now I'm not

275
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,270
saying it isn't real we do need these

276
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:07,910
people society community industry

277
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:12,199
nations every one of them is facing

278
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:15,709
genuine and real threats what we do in

279
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:18,020
our profession is important stuff it's

280
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,000
just I think too many people keep going

281
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:23,329
on about how special you are or how

282
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,540
special we are and really leads to that

283
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:28,480
taking ourselves far too seriously but

284
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,770
then we are charged with defending

285
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,810
societies from attack relied on to

286
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,939
enable corporate success we sit and

287
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,349
stuff about how security should be

288
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,330
enabling the business to make more money

289
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,560
we should be defending it to stop it

290
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,170
from being attacked we should be

291
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,069
stopping all this money from flowing out

292
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:46,189
we should be securing our nation's

293
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:48,110
secrets etc you know I get some picture

294
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:51,740
it's like what we do in cyber echoes

295
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:55,160
across eternity and I just find it it's

296
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:58,880
all a bit heavy pressure much it's like

297
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,439
no that this isn't what I do

298
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,470
so the reasons I do what I do and he's

299
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,580
certainly not why I got into it when I

300
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:10,370
got started it wasn't even a proper job

301
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:14,420
there was no internet fame or fortune we

302
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:17,060
weren't seen as digital heroes if I said

303
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:21,410
what I did as a pen tester my friend

304
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:24,260
sniggered we were seen as dirty hackers

305
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:27,620
exploits didn't have logos or websites

306
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:30,290
or marketing teams I didn't know it was

307
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:32,090
a job I just sort of fell into it I'm

308
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:34,130
really I fell into it like a lot of

309
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:36,110
other people just through curiosity and

310
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:38,600
experimentation wondering how that works

311
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,930
well I'm not gonna ask someone how it

312
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,730
works

313
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,410
possibly they don't know I need to break

314
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:46,370
into it I need to open it up I need to

315
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:49,010
figure it out and ya know you need

316
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,990
others thought it was some sort of life

317
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:56,689
skill for survival in a new digital age

318
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:59,000
and all this shit some activists you

319
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,220
know a call to arms to start the new

320
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,230
digital revolution so it's not like this

321
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,030
cyber warrior stuff now isn't new new

322
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:08,270
there was other people back in the day

323
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:11,270
still living out there as different

324
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:13,400
fantasies online but most people myself

325
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:15,560
included were just dicking around with

326
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,510
computers just geeking out in our

327
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,359
bedrooms playing with stuff for the fun

328
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:22,010
of it we just we didn't take ourselves

329
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,990
seriously we didn't think we were

330
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:26,120
serious people no one took us seriously

331
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:30,380
either we were just doing it for the

332
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,640
lulz and today it's very different so

333
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,300
but I don't know when it kind of

334
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,439
happened please

335
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:39,250
snuck up on me apparently now we're all

336
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,330
cyber warriors defending the world

337
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,740
safeguarding the digital future for

338
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,720
everybody and you get stuff like this

339
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:49,910
from consultancies like that's their red

340
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:54,200
team or whatever please so you get this

341
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:56,890
stuff as well call to battle to protect

342
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,930
our nation's on the digital battlefield

343
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:02,449
you know those guys over there that are

344
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:05,959
wearing camo that even laugh at this

345
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:08,540
year hey who do we think we are we are

346
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:12,140
not digital soldiers we are not cyber

347
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:15,110
warriors it's nonsense there is no

348
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,580
cyber terrain to capture but in reality

349
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,160
this is what it is you remove the

350
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:22,400
marketing spin the attractive come in

351
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:27,350
cyber etc and you just end up in a big

352
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:30,760
caught drinking locale dairy-free lattes

353
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:33,320
auditing systems and doing PCI reports

354
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,810
but obviously that doesn't attract many

355
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,660
people to the industry but I mean like

356
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:42,829
it doesn't have to end up that way it

357
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:46,010
doesn't have to be this so I kind of

358
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:50,030
want to ask why did it stop being about

359
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:52,280
having fun for people why did it taking

360
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:56,930
all that is super serious and all those

361
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:59,199
threats and things are real but why was

362
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:01,959
the fun gone now I speak to a lot of

363
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,970
young people coming into the industry

364
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:08,660
events like this when we interview them

365
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:10,610
etc and they're just so super seriously

366
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,719
they're all about their career how far

367
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,800
is their career gonna go when they're

368
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,720
gonna get that title when they're gonna

369
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,329
get that badge how are they going to end

370
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,880
up as a CEO or something and Jesus

371
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,800
that's depressing

372
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,600
it's just but they've come through this

373
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,790
in doctrine they've come from a factory

374
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,460
line producing these people they think

375
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:30,500
the same way the Seavey's are templated

376
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,420
the places they study that they've all

377
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,330
got the same skills but there's no

378
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,459
creativity innovation there is some

379
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:40,580
people still we're for sure not everyone

380
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:43,430
was the same but there is unmask a lot

381
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,720
of people that are just in this to get a

382
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,859
career and that's fine

383
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,150
there's nothing wrong with that if

384
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,490
that's what they've chosen to do with

385
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,600
their lives I just wonder why people

386
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,910
aren't doing a little bit of reflection

387
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,470
and wondering could they not be enjoying

388
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,600
themselves a little bit more with it and

389
00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:00,050
stop stressing out I'm putting all that

390
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,600
pressure on yourself it's still a very

391
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:07,310
young industry and there's a lot of time

392
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:09,260
to correct it so as a very brief quick

393
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,940
example this is a vent that we run

394
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,270
called hak foo it's happening right now

395
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,800
in a prison of in Rutland and we just

396
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:18,109
get people down there for a couple of

397
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,060
days this year it's a prison it's been

398
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:21,849
the Wild West it's been an army base

399
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,470
it's been all the things

400
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:26,109
and there's a whole bunch of hacking

401
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,610
challenges some of the stuff you'd be

402
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,329
familiar with like you know Web Apps

403
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:31,479
sequel injection

404
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:34,990
Alissa's defusing bombs building robots

405
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:37,090
to do specific tasks and it's an

406
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,610
immersive learning experience but the

407
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:41,949
most hot day is about having fun

408
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:44,469
we take our people throw them for a

409
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,930
couple of days into a random weird

410
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:49,360
unique venue with all sorts of shit

411
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,850
going on and they just play and have fun

412
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,000
and learn stuff in a safe environment

413
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:57,850
and I would do that over any

414
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,070
cybersecurity course training course

415
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:02,590
education program classroom based stuff

416
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,909
any day and if you're interested go and

417
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,709
look at the videos now I'm not pitching

418
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,910
this cuz we don't sell it you can only

419
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,260
go to it if you work for him to be or

420
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,360
not to network more people are just

421
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,340
saying there are different ways of

422
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,840
teaching people skills and there are

423
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,240
different ways to give people the

424
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,090
freedom to learn things and experiment

425
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,930
and have fun them what is happening in

426
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:25,899
most places but I mean basically back in

427
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:29,110
my day I just wanted to hack shit just

428
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:32,440
because it was fun it is fun it still is

429
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:34,959
so my advice to anyone that's still here

430
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:39,660
and listening is like don't stress about

431
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:44,110
job titles exams certs training courses

432
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:46,060
career wealth stuff shit it it's just

433
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:48,669
gonna put you in a big big dark black

434
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,590
hole where there's no fun so just break

435
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,270
stuff and mixed up I'm not even

436
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:54,129
advocating that you just go and destroy

437
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:55,570
everything that you see and find the

438
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,250
bugs and the weaknesses go and create

439
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:01,210
something new as well build something

440
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:03,730
for defense build something the Internet

441
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,440
of Things is just full of shit but there

442
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,960
could be some good stuff in there if

443
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,640
people actually went and built it and

444
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,320
play with it and experimented with it

445
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,820
and built something new it doesn't have

446
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,520
to be about breaking stuff it's just

447
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:18,450
doing stuff for shits and giggles

448
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:21,760
so enjoy your job enjoy your life and

449
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,350
maybe perhaps there'll be internet fame

450
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,940
and all the money's will would be

451
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,409
bestowed on you but maybe not you

452
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,720
shouldn't be doing it for those reasons

453
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,450
you know definitely don't think about

454
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,670
being a digital cyber hero tomorrow's

455
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:36,980
future digital battleground or whatever

456
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:40,210
so I'm sorry if that was a bit rentee

457
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:42,680
but the most I hope it will just

458
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,880
challenge you to think about where you

459
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,710
are in your own careers what you're

460
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,330
doing why are you doing it and just go

461
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:49,280
back to your offices your home's your

462
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:51,530
labs your classrooms whatever you got

463
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,720
going on and just do some awesome and

464
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,310
fun for yourselves to play with

465
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,620
something to break something to make

466
00:19:55,310 --> 00:20:01,730
something whatever just really explore

467
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:04,070
that creative side instead of coming to

468
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:07,520
some presentations where they tell you

469
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,689
about some tall how to use it how to do

470
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,730
your job and then you take that

471
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,340
information you go away you template you

472
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,950
do copy sell some of the people have

473
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:18,020
spoken to you if either created tools

474
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:20,270
forge new paths themselves when they've

475
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,550
been doing their own research and yes

476
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:24,860
it's useful they share it with you but

477
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:27,200
you shouldn't just consume and repeat

478
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,000
she'd go and play and safely experiment

479
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,430
with it yourself and do something

480
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,450
yourself okay so basically at the end of

481
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:43,060
it just have fun and enjoy I don't think

482
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:43,060
there'll be any questions thank you
