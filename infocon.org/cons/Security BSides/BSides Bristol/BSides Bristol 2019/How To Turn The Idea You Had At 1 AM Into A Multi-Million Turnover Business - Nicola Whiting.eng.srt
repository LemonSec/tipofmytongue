1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:08,299
and cliff thank you very much thank you

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,639
yeah the words are how to take the idea

3
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:14,500
that you have at 1:00 a.m. and and turn

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:17,810
it into a multi-million company and

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:21,200
there's I'll present it today but I just

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:23,918
want a quick question has anybody here

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:27,590
got a mom who's like a multimillionaire

8
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:29,630
no okay then that's kind of cool because

9
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,509
there are some ideas in this

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,940
presentation that potentially only a mom

11
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:37,580
would buy and I probably wouldn't have

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,650
invested in in any of these but what's

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,710
really interesting is that pet rock one

14
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:45,440
has anybody from the 70s like okay

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,810
there's a couple of us that pet rock one

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,150
I I really wanted one of those and they

17
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,230
were three dollars 95 maybe they started

18
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,660
in San Francisco

19
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,400
and then I Frank I came from a council

20
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,690
estate so my mom did get me one but she

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:01,940
said that she couldn't she lost the

22
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:03,949
packaging so so basically the the pet

23
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:07,550
rock sold one and a half million units

24
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,930
and made that guy a millionaire so you

25
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:13,039
know rock in a box I would never even

26
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:15,220
vested in that the the Rubik's Cube but

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,799
she'll be very familiar with has sold

28
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:21,620
350 million of those things and they're

29
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,270
2017 retail figures were two hundred and

30
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,040
fifty million dollars which was a

31
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:29,119
forty-five percent increase on the year

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,470
before plastic toy the last one I've put

33
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,680
in tribute to the fact that my hubby

34
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:38,150
gave me a cold this week and it's the

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,440
hay fever hat from Japan I'm not really

36
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,060
sure whether that's going to make

37
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,590
millions the jewelry's out on that but

38
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,299
hey the fact that they got somebody to

39
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,250
invest in it is nothing to be sneezed at

40
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:51,530
puns like this will happen

41
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:56,119
I apologize in advance so to actually

42
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:59,960
create this kind of business is often in

43
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:02,950
this or firm build it and they will come

44
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:06,169
model and that is one of the two models

45
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:08,030
the businesses tend to run on has

46
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,239
anybody seen that Field of Dreams fill

47
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:15,139
with Kevin Costner a couple of you so

48
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:16,400
the premise is Rea a farmer in Iowa is

49
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:18,650
in a coal

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,900
field and he hears a voice that says if

51
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:23,689
you build it he will come and he has a

52
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,439
vision of building a baseball field and

53
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:29,030
it all works out well in the end because

54
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:31,900
Shoeless Joe Jackson and some of his

55
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:36,560
baseball greats turn up to play ball

56
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:38,540
because it's a movie when they're ghosts

57
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,609
because it's a movie it's actually

58
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:44,328
really good movie but kind of strange

59
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:46,129
the other the other model is to go with

60
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:48,700
the tried and trusted module and and

61
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:53,298
that might be more talked about today

62
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:55,940
because in 2016 Bloomberg did a study

63
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:58,150
and it said that 8 out of 10 startups

64
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:02,420
fail in the first 18 months

65
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:08,659
sonna sake and the top three reasons

66
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:12,230
were lack of cash no plan or lack of

67
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:13,819
clear value proposition and the rest

68
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,518
were to do with sales marketing and

69
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:18,409
management I'm not going to talk to you

70
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,989
today about raising cash but I am going

71
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:23,840
to touch on all of the other things and

72
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:26,930
the great thing is the figures are

73
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,780
better now so over just over half of

74
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,000
businesses now pass that 18-month mark

75
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:36,560
which is good that's just over half

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,299
50/50 towing costs and I want to really

77
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,280
massively increase your chances of

78
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:43,340
success so that if you do have that idea

79
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,620
at 1:00 a.m. that you might stand a

80
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,030
chance of validating it and seeing if

81
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,940
it's actually a goer and whether it

82
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:53,750
might make use some cash so we're going

83
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:57,889
to cover today all of the things that we

84
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:59,540
wish we'd known 10 years ago when when

85
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:01,780
Ian sat in his bedroom and I'd like to

86
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:07,159
introduce you to Ian

87
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:09,769
our genius creator this is Ian he's the

88
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,659
founder of titania and the creator of

89
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:14,840
nipper studio and I'll let him just say

90
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:19,048
how he came up with that idea so excuse

91
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:21,269
the picture and I really are

92
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:23,698
I really am still fond of the Amiga but

93
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:27,479
there's no place in the modern world

94
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:32,009
unfortunately it really was as a

95
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:33,300
penetration tester at the time and there

96
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:35,669
were a lot of things about the job that

97
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,740
really bored me and things that are

98
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:39,900
repetitive doing the same thing over and

99
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,550
over and over again and wherever

100
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,620
possible I'm guessing just like

101
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,419
yourselves I tried to use automation and

102
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,919
script see various other things to try

103
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,710
to consider eight what I was doing I

104
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:52,139
turned it for a job one day and they

105
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,229
gave me 30 configurations and Cisco

106
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:57,000
devices and at that state is like hell

107
00:04:55,229 --> 00:05:00,120
no am I going to go through 30

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,770
configurations manually and there really

109
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,030
wasn't a lot of great tools out there

110
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,620
that can actually help me as a

111
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,270
penetration tester get the kind of

112
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,210
information that I wanted out those

113
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,849
conflicts so really titania started and

114
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,318
nipper started because I thought no I'm

115
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:17,159
actually going to spend the time instead

116
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:19,289
of a third of a day for each device kind

117
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:20,669
of going for it line by line trying to

118
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:22,349
work out where there may be security

119
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:24,659
issues I thought no I'm going to

120
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:27,750
automate this thing and and start

121
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:30,630
letting the computers work for me rather

122
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:33,030
than me work for computers so that's

123
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,849
what I did and dipper started off very

124
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,948
simply as a PHP script many many years

125
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:39,779
ago really embarrassing but it was

126
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:41,310
really quick for me to just cut

127
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:43,139
something together obviously it's very

128
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:47,279
different now and there's a whole team

129
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:49,289
aligned well pass back so Ian founded

130
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,560
the company literally in his bedroom

131
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:56,039
when somebody came and offered him some

132
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:59,520
cash and he went oh I need a vehicle to

133
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,500
accept this cash now what was really

134
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,990
interesting is before he'd done that he

135
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,240
run it in terms of please give us

136
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,050
donations to help build this thing and

137
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,419
make it better

138
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,940
and in two years do you run it in that

139
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,889
model how many donations did you have

140
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,599
what so there was a really good reason

141
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:19,830
that we had to go commercial to buy

142
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:24,050
people to help us build this so it's

143
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:28,320
just a thousand pounds well that's less

144
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:30,149
later so so essentially we had to go

145
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,370
commercial to actually make it into what

146
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:34,570
it

147
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:36,430
today so this is our Walt Disney and as

148
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:38,469
you know Walt Disney was a massive

149
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,060
creator now I'm married to this man and

150
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,100
I'm just going to say that before I say

151
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,440
that Ian's brain is like a pinball

152
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,940
machine it's constant ideas I spoken to

153
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,830
some of the people in this room today I

154
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,330
know you're the same I also saved lot

155
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,130
two reball generators because they just

156
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,330
keep coming out sometimes I'm pushing

157
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,110
them back in at the other end because

158
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,900
they're not quite ready

159
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:59,350
he once woke me up at 1:00 a.m. while

160
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:01,270
asleep to tell me about a tissue app I'm

161
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:04,419
not even going to go further into that

162
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,460
conversation but essentially in his Walt

163
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:10,389
Disney

164
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:12,909
I'm his Roy Disney so when you are

165
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:15,490
looking to build a company one of the

166
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:18,610
things that you want to identify is are

167
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:22,240
you the idea creator or are you the

168
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:27,520
integrator and poker of balloons with

169
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,960
pins I'm the CEO of the crew so Ian will

170
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,570
often come up to me with an idea and

171
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,469
I'll go not sure that's really ready for

172
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:37,270
the market yet which is my code for put

173
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:41,440
it back in the box and hatchets some

174
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:43,659
more so I've done quite a lot of stuff

175
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,310
in the mentoring space may need for

176
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,849
building businesses and I work with the

177
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,940
D IT and cyber accelerators and I do

178
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:53,800
quite a lot of speaking and writing on

179
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:56,050
the future of things because that's

180
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:01,930
where I am I'm not a technologist I'm a

181
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:03,669
strategist so this I put in because it

182
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,400
was one of our best days ever when we

183
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:10,030
went to go meet the Queen so Ian built

184
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,099
it I helped build the company and we

185
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:14,799
both therefore got to meet the Queen

186
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:16,449
which was really cool and that was for

187
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,710
the innovation that he created because

188
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:20,699
he was the first in the world to create

189
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:25,359
it which was really really fabulous and

190
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:27,400
what we're really lucky to say is the in

191
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,099
building some of that stuff and in the

192
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,719
fact that Ian's mates rule pen testers

193
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:33,189
and pen testers like to introduce cool

194
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,810
things to people and they all go to

195
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,900
really big companies because they're the

196
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:40,530
people that will pay pen testers we were

197
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:43,088
also really lucky to build a fantastic

198
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:45,610
range of clients and these are just

199
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:47,160
some of the ones that will let us tell

200
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:50,430
you about them

201
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,839
so how did we get clients like these

202
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:56,050
aliens already mentioned that he didn't

203
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,089
want to spend like 15 days and then all

204
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:02,609
of the report writing to do his first

205
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:08,500
iteration but essentially why we grew

206
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:11,129
was because we added value and we help

207
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:16,089
our clients get to their goals quicker

208
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:17,680
and this is the sort of start of what

209
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:20,529
you'll need to look at to see whether

210
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,209
the idea that you've had at 1 a.m. has

211
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:23,649
got legs for other people you know

212
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:26,109
whether they might be interested in

213
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:30,220
getting value off you in exchange for

214
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:32,680
cash from them so one example recently

215
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:38,139
socially the products developed was we

216
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:40,449
went to a military base and we spoke to

217
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:41,790
some of their auditing teams there and I

218
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:45,310
think they said how long did it take

219
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:47,769
what their uses so they were using

220
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:49,869
spreadsheets to do their audits and it

221
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:52,750
took them about a month I believe to do

222
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:55,240
one base and now it takes them less than

223
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,910
a week a few days so that's the kind of

224
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,470
time scale and it isn't that we're

225
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,930
losing people you know there's a people

226
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,519
shortage it's with taking you know you

227
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,989
go to the cyber generals but you

228
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,360
shouldn't be filling sandbags or doing

229
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,579
housekeeping so this is the way of

230
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,649
releasing some of that stuff that's

231
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:17,819
essential for pouring and automating it

232
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:19,899
so when you want to test your value

233
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:21,128
there's going to be a lot of book things

234
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:22,750
here I know you'll be able to get the

235
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:26,050
slides afterwards but you may want to

236
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:28,420
open your Amazon page now so the one

237
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:31,389
that I would recommend to anybody is

238
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:34,420
called the strategizes theories it comes

239
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:36,160
in a really cool book like that if any

240
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,719
of you want to Nick any of these later

241
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,750
please come and just help yourself

242
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,480
because these these books are a fortune

243
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:45,189
you probably only need a few pages but

244
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:50,290
essentially what it does is it lets you

245
00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:52,870
test your concept by putting yourself in

246
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,410
a potential clients position so the page

247
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:57,959
looks a bit like this

248
00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:00,779
so what you're looking at is what is

249
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,939
this person trying to do well I need to

250
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:05,279
be able to harden my configurations on

251
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,940
firewall switches on Reuters what are

252
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,769
their fears

253
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,200
it's a Cisco device and my money trained

254
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:13,829
on juniper or I haven't got time

255
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,779
whatever it that might be you know what

256
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:19,019
are their needs to do it faster to do it

257
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:22,079
consistently yadda yadda yadda and all

258
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:25,079
of your time should be spent on that

259
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,390
right hand side really unpacking it just

260
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:29,370
to give you an idea we titania go off

261
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,760
with the leadership team once a year

262
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:35,070
from probably about four or five days to

263
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,510
just a you know in hotel or a site and

264
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,339
we just get out of our business so we

265
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,350
can work on the business we spent one

266
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,060
and a half days doing this because we do

267
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,220
it every now and again just to refresh

268
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:47,040
what are people still looking for and

269
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:50,820
have their needs changed and then from

270
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,529
that you then create your product so we

271
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,990
were really lucky because ian was the

272
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:57,930
first customer of the product so he

273
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,940
built what he wanted and give you an

274
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,319
idea of what that might look like if you

275
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:06,630
were say creating something for a

276
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,820
startup accelerator you can see if you

277
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,500
were starting a business bearing in mind

278
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,959
cash is one of the problems what are you

279
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,459
going to want so you're not going to

280
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,349
want to know you're gonna want to know

281
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:18,390
what's my rents going to be if I have to

282
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,399
get a little office and you want to have

283
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:23,010
that as consistent right you're gonna

284
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,589
want to know what are maybe an employee

285
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,329
costs gonna be you're gonna worry about

286
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:28,980
funding you're going to worry about how

287
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:33,420
do i market stuff i've never done that

288
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:35,220
before how do I sell this now Ian

289
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,170
actually worked for a pen testing

290
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,790
company while he built his business so

291
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,290
he took his salary and he paid somebody

292
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:44,519
else to develop another product to

293
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:50,040
longside so his first hire was another

294
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:51,120
developer and his third hire was

295
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,649
somebody to answer the phones because

296
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,959
these people kept phoning him up and

297
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:56,040
interrupting his coding time to try and

298
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,579
give him money which was really

299
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:02,670
inconvenient it's really inconvenient so

300
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:05,040
I was the third employee sorry that the

301
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:07,740
third sort of first second first

302
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:11,550
salesperson employee and

303
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:14,130
and essentially I then went oh okay what

304
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:15,959
happens if we actively answer these

305
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:19,230
things and properly speak to people and

306
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,630
as it turns out it resulted in rapid

307
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,790
growth as you can imagine

308
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:26,700
so it was like 45 percent plus growth

309
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:28,800
which was great and then we built some

310
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,930
more people in as well so essentially

311
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,969
that's the the process you can see if

312
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:36,540
you were starting a business that quiet

313
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,770
space you know Harvard of accelerators

314
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:42,540
you can see how they're starting to do

315
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:45,030
position in there so what this series

316
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,890
helps you do is identify what problem

317
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:49,589
you're solving how you're going to make

318
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:53,280
your clients lives better what value

319
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:56,790
you're going to add and then on top of

320
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:59,579
that it's who are they buying into so

321
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,839
let's say you probably any of you like

322
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,120
to do this let's say you're starting up

323
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,460
a hairdresser or a coffee shop are you

324
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:10,590
going to be unique on the high street

325
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:12,570
no but do you have a preferred one yes

326
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:14,850
because there will be something that

327
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:17,160
that place has that the other people

328
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,170
don't have even if it's the guy behind

329
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,550
the counter is just like you and like

330
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:24,060
your like his t-shirts I've never heard

331
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:27,390
teachers so you need to be able to find

332
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:29,699
your unique thing and your unique thing

333
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:32,939
maybe nobody else in the planet is doing

334
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,950
this and I have a lot of people come

335
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,510
into those accelerators going I've come

336
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,370
up with this well I've been into

337
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,990
University and I've worked in this thing

338
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,420
and I've come up with this nobody else

339
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:44,460
in the planet is doing this and myself

340
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,839
and the other mentors will go yeah

341
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,670
actually there's probably about three

342
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,150
other people that are doing this in

343
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:54,990
America or Australia because it's a

344
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:56,100
global world now so it's very rare that

345
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,820
you're going to come up with something

346
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:05,310
that is really truly unique so what you

347
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:07,920
need to do is be able to unpack that the

348
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,839
strongest organizations trust me are the

349
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,010
ones where they've really worked out

350
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,040
what their vision is and they can

351
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:16,920
communicate that I have sat in a lot of

352
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,079
rooms where people have spent 15 minutes

353
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,180
trying to explain to me what value

354
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,400
they're going to give those clients

355
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,650
if that's their elevator pitch the

356
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:29,100
person's left the room and shut the

357
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:32,160
doors on them electronically so another

358
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:35,160
thing in my top book list from Amazon

359
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,870
would be start with why not because

360
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,579
Simon sites I neck does that lovely

361
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,250
bullseye thing and it has why in the

362
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:44,460
middle and everything else but because

363
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:47,220
what it helps you do is say what is

364
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,710
going to keep me motivated to go home

365
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,180
every night and keep coding rather than

366
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,560
going out then to the pub and having

367
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,660
pizza because you know that's the choice

368
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,760
or the latest game comes out it's like

369
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,829
what's going to be more important than

370
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,230
that to me and then potentially what's

371
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:03,210
going to be more important to my team

372
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,680
because if you want a load of people to

373
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,990
join you and you're on a shoestring

374
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,060
budget then this is going to be

375
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,440
something that is kind of exciting that

376
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,459
they're going to want to be part of that

377
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,980
they're going to have want to work late

378
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,630
into the night with you together on and

379
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,660
that's really important and then

380
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:23,640
obviously how does it benefit your

381
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:25,319
potential clients now this is a kind of

382
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,350
little bit of a paraphrase of something

383
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,180
here the Wright brothers and being a

384
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:32,210
woman in technology I kind of like this

385
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:35,910
story and I'll tell you why in a minute

386
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:39,120
but I'm guessing everybody here knows

387
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:42,500
who the Wright brothers are so anybody

388
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,480
know their first names just shout it out

389
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:48,450
Orville and Wilbur absolutely fantastic

390
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:55,560
well done anybody know the guy on the

391
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:58,080
left is good guess that guy is Samuel

392
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,839
Pierpoint Longley and he was the guy

393
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,660
that's supposed to develop the flight so

394
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,579
he was at the head of the Smithsonian at

395
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:09,079
the time which is a very prestigious

396
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:13,889
organization he was a well-regarded

397
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:15,359
engineer and and he had the backing of

398
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:18,030
the War Department which is a bit like

399
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,790
being backed by Bill Gates now and he

400
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:23,339
had a chief engineer who was the

401
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,349
equivalent of Tesla he had all the press

402
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:27,959
following him he was the guy that was

403
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:31,179
supposed to do flight but what he was

404
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:34,960
chasing was being first to success and

405
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:36,430
his name be forever remembered in

406
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,680
history and obviously none of you know

407
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:41,020
who he is which is good

408
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:43,570
the Wright brothers did it because they

409
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:47,020
wanted to connect people and that means

410
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:50,139
two blokes have a bike shop in Dayton

411
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:52,120
Ohio where the people actually did that

412
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:54,580
job and the difference between those two

413
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:58,090
was the vision that they managed to talk

414
00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:00,010
to their fellow townspeople with because

415
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,320
they were all in on it too and the bit

416
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,800
that I really loved it's twofold one

417
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,419
this is what Bill Gates said about them

418
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,310
they created the single greatest

419
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,980
cultural force since the invention of

420
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:14,649
writing and the aeroplane became the

421
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:17,110
first worldwide web bringing people

422
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,210
languages ideas and values together that

423
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:21,250
always makes me just a little bit choked

424
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,140
up because you know you just think it

425
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,810
actually yes that was the first time

426
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:29,320
people could actually travel easily and

427
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:32,500
now every day people can get on a plane

428
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,689
for you know a reasonable amount of

429
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:38,140
money and travel across the world the

430
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:44,680
other part that I love is a woman called

431
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:47,980
Sarah Sarah Wright who was the daughter

432
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:50,080
of a wheelwright and sat in her father's

433
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:54,750
workshop learning and the engineering

434
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:57,040
trade and Sarah was their mother and

435
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,450
their father was a bishop and he went

436
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,100
overseas and he brought back this little

437
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,990
model plane which inspired them but it

438
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,240
was Sarah that taught them engineering

439
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,850
and it was Sarah that they spent all

440
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,490
that time at the feet of who worked with

441
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,990
them on the plane and probably

442
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,270
everybody's heard of Sarah about as much

443
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:21,670
as they've heard of Samuel Pierpont

444
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:24,550
Langley so this is the other thing that

445
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:27,100
you will have to learn about because if

446
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:28,300
you have a thing and you need to be able

447
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,820
to define that thing

448
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:33,100
then the strategizes series is really

449
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:36,120
great but that will just tell you maybe

450
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:42,810
how to talk about it technically and

451
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:42,810
actually that's not how people by

452
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,919
so one wasn't as well as a woman in

453
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,930
technology I'm autistic and what that

454
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:54,890
has meant for me is from the age of 16

455
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:57,500
I've studied psychology because I'm a

456
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,810
Vulcan in a roomful of humans I didn't

457
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,730
get how you guys worked so unless you're

458
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:03,950
narrow diverse in which case you'd

459
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:06,980
probably completely understand how I

460
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:09,530
feel sometimes but essentially I did a

461
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,940
lot of study from the age of 16 and

462
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,440
there weren't that many books then you

463
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,800
know it was maybe how to impress and

464
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:19,130
influence people by Dale Carnegie but

465
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:22,159
what I discovered was really cool so we

466
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:23,780
have the Windows XP of brains in fact

467
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:28,480
it's not even that good it's it's Vista

468
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:31,399
we have Vista as an operating system and

469
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,380
what's interesting is that Vista

470
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:37,250
operating system is more predictable

471
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:41,870
than you think and that you can learn

472
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:44,090
its operating language now I'm gonna

473
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:49,639
talk to you just for a little bit about

474
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:54,350
that stuff but I want to ask you to kind

475
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:56,570
of make a deal with me because if you do

476
00:20:54,350 --> 00:21:00,320
learn this it's properly ninja level

477
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:03,409
marketing but you can influence people a

478
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,330
lot with these kind of things

479
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,640
I know social engineering is very

480
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,399
popular but this is the same thing but

481
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,960
in marketing terms and to me this is

482
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,640
really important because the difference

483
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,040
between influence and manipulation is

484
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,540
who you're doing it for if you are

485
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,970
trying to help your client by

486
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,980
influencing them to buy something that

487
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,780
you know will help them its influences

488
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,880
it's a good thing it's a win-win if

489
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,470
you've got some kind of back of the car

490
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,420
thing that you know doesn't work and

491
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:33,800
you've created they pretend they're moe

492
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:35,750
that is manipulation so please do not

493
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,300
listen if you're the second set of

494
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,190
people is that okay I'm just gonna

495
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,840
obviously you'll carry on listening cuz

496
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,220
if you're the second set of people pay

497
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,000
no attention at all and you learn all

498
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:49,760
this really cool stuff so logic versus

499
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,990
emotions you've been sitting out for a

500
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,990
little why would you like or just stand

501
00:21:53,950 --> 00:22:00,670
stand up so I'm here talk to you very

502
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:04,640
quickly

503
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:06,170
who knows who Spock is awesome he's a

504
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,740
Vulcan for those people who don't know

505
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:14,990
what he is

506
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:18,140
so he's based on logic okay Vulcans how

507
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:20,030
Vulcan but essentially this is how I

508
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,660
feel a lot of the time logical on the

509
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,030
outside

510
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,100
loads of emotion inside but essentially

511
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:27,320
he will try and make things make

512
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,149
decisions based on logic and he will get

513
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,399
loads of facts and he will weigh the

514
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:34,820
options and he will make things like

515
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,720
that and then you've got chimp guy on

516
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:39,439
the right

517
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:42,110
that's they've got feeling it would be

518
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,880
McCoy to his Spock the one that is

519
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:48,320
basically always going to take shortcuts

520
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:51,020
and will believe fake news now if you

521
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,090
think that you mainly mainly make

522
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,200
decisions that are quite logical and

523
00:22:53,090 --> 00:23:01,939
that you'll be reasoned in your

524
00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:05,000
decisions please sit down now if you

525
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:07,820
think you mainly make your decisions

526
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:13,280
based on gut feeling instinct please sit

527
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:14,810
down okay now I use the word mainly here

528
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,110
so the rest of you think you're somehow

529
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:22,730
perfectly balanced human beings which is

530
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:24,110
really interesting but I'll let you sit

531
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:26,180
down as well it's really it's an

532
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:28,429
interesting thing because in every talk

533
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:30,620
I've done except for for ones where

534
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:32,720
they're in psychology places most people

535
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,370
do the same thing and I'm going to tell

536
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,400
you a little bit about neuroscience

537
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:40,219
which i think is really interesting that

538
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,880
little pshape thing on the left you're a

539
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,330
Magdala

540
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,070
is kind of where your chimp lives and

541
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:47,570
the frontal lobe that's what let's let's

542
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,120
say that's where your Spock lives and

543
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:54,020
the really interesting thing for me is

544
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:58,669
that all of your senses your sights your

545
00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:00,980
sound hit what you touch everything goes

546
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,960
to the Magdala first that it's faster

547
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,790
and it makes the decisions for you

548
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,050
before your logical mind can

549
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:10,399
even engage so technically it's really

550
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,139
quite hard for you to make a logical

551
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,680
decision that you haven't already made

552
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:18,560
at some level emotionally now some

553
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,780
people go really

554
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:25,370
I'm not logical I'm pretty sure I'm

555
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:26,510
logical know who's everybody's gone into

556
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:30,800
a phone shop right and bought a phone

557
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:32,240
yeah did you pick it up and if it was

558
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,750
heavier you thought that's probably good

559
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,630
quality I think yes you did didn't you

560
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:40,540
yeah you did okay so that's what your

561
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,250
chimp that's that's a decision on an

562
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:49,070
operating system and a holic customer

563
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:51,920
experience based on weight no I love

564
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:54,080
stuff like that it's like okay I think

565
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,400
this is obviously already better quality

566
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,960
because it's got a really flat battery

567
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,050
on the back of it now so probably

568
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,570
improved its whole user experience but

569
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:04,340
essentially the reason that 150,000 year

570
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:06,050
old brain works like that is let's say a

571
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:08,570
mugger run into the ring with a knife it

572
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:10,010
doesn't want you strategically working

573
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,990
out the risks that they're going to be

574
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:14,810
successful it once you add the door and

575
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:16,460
running and we operate a bit like that

576
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:19,250
still so that's why some people find

577
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,320
public speaking really hard because you

578
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,290
are on your own in front of a bunch of

579
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:26,000
people that potentially could be

580
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:28,070
adversarial and it doesn't matter what

581
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,500
your logical mind says that's what your

582
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:36,710
chimp is doing yeah so we make quite a

583
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:41,600
lot of modern-day decisions based on

584
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:44,120
primitive brain types now what does that

585
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,030
mean in terms of marketing well it means

586
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:51,260
there are certain things like scent a

587
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:52,300
preference like anchoring and all those

588
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:55,550
kind of things

589
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:57,649
term got time to go into fully here that

590
00:25:55,550 --> 00:26:00,110
you can learn and that methods of

591
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:02,360
persuasion book talks about all of them

592
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:05,449
so there is a reason why you often get

593
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:08,120
three options you know when you go to a

594
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:12,790
checkout three options and one just

595
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:15,469
seems too good to be true marketing or

596
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:16,580
that lovely one where they say oh you

597
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,720
know it's going to be a really

598
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,928
reasonable price it's not like it's

599
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,570
going

600
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:25,369
be a million quid it's only gonna be 150

601
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:28,908
thousand pounds anchoring so there is a

602
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:31,999
whole heap of stuff that is very easy to

603
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:34,190
learn and when you learn it not only

604
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:35,539
you're better equipped to help promote

605
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:37,789
your own product but you're also better

606
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:39,649
equipped to understand what people are

607
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:42,590
trying to do when they either influence

608
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:46,820
or manipulate you now what does that

609
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:50,779
mean in terms of running a company where

610
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:53,389
you don't want to manipulate people or

611
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:56,210
you want to build trust with people now

612
00:26:53,389 --> 00:26:58,369
you've all bought stuff yeah have you

613
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:00,320
ever bought anything unless you really

614
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:07,220
had to because you had no other choice

615
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:08,840
know whether I'm net that was from an

616
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,559
untrustworthy person where they make

617
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,449
your skin crawl

618
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:16,970
would you buy something from that person

619
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:18,259
no thank you thank you for the big shake

620
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,999
because I don't recognise

621
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:22,970
microexpression so that's really helpful

622
00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:24,080
so you don't you don't buy stuff from

623
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:28,399
people you don't trust

624
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:33,189
so why do we do things like referrals

625
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:33,189
and test sites and trials and

626
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:40,190
testimonials well it's actually because

627
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:42,199
it helps her show credibility so Trust

628
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:45,399
involves credibility is this personal

629
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:48,429
I'm going to buy something from credible

630
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:51,439
how interest is a really interesting one

631
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:52,700
if you can't see what's in it for the

632
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,240
other person does it make you feel

633
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:59,210
slightly uncomfortable

634
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:00,799
yeah the amount of companies I've been

635
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:03,649
to where they kind of go ah this is just

636
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:06,110
with just so generous it's just all for

637
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:10,600
you there's nothing in it for us at all

638
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:13,490
and you go yeah what's your top it's a

639
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,719
no that isn't how it works is it you

640
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,730
know that that isn't true

641
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,110
so there is nothing wrong at all in

642
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,249
saying what's in it for me is this big

643
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:21,498
pot of money that you're going to give

644
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:22,970
me or what's in it for me is that you're

645
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:25,929
going to give me a big pot of money and

646
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:28,730
we'll do this if you're a referral site

647
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:30,289
it's absolutely fine and that's how it

648
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,520
should work it should be a win-win

649
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:34,220
scenario

650
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,840
and then the really cool thing which

651
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:40,070
that marketing stuff will help you with

652
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:43,070
is the communication part now our

653
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:46,580
industry really loves to make up new

654
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:48,350
words and then if your customer can't

655
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:53,030
keep up with the new words they're dumb

656
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:55,520
right no that's not the case if your

657
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:58,520
customer can't understand what's in it

658
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:04,100
for them who is the person that's going

659
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:06,350
to miss out it's not the customer so the

660
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:08,480
communication part is really important

661
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,800
because if they don't get that you're

662
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,290
credible because you can't communicate

663
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,700
it to them and if they don't get what's

664
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:16,070
in it for them and what's in it for you

665
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,809
then the trust won't happen either so

666
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:20,899
that it's a triangle for a reason you

667
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:23,629
actually need all three things so if you

668
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:27,320
want a credible reputation do not be

669
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:30,710
this guy I think I saw I took that

670
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:33,080
picture in post I know I didn't so this

671
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:35,390
is the guy of the shiny disco balls and

672
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,760
the smoke and mirrors and you don't want

673
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:39,740
to be sold to like that I don't want to

674
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,450
be sold to like that there is a reason

675
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:46,960
that people walk around with bingo cards

676
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:50,420
at the big shows you've all had them so

677
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,670
really really simple for sales you treat

678
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:56,059
others like you want to be treated and

679
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:58,070
you build relationships now if you

680
00:29:56,059 --> 00:30:03,230
haven't had experience of sales that's

681
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:04,760
fine like Ian hired somebody in if you

682
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:06,860
build a business you will probably end

683
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,140
up hiring somebody in but you'll

684
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:12,379
probably in the early stages also have

685
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:14,300
to go to those meetings now you learn

686
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:17,000
coding right or you learn how to do

687
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:20,480
whatever your current role is this is

688
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,429
the same it is a learnable skill let me

689
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,900
know you may not end up being you know

690
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:29,210
PT Barnum hopefully not but you can

691
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:32,450
learn these skills and a really good

692
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:34,340
shortcut to learning what a trusted

693
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:37,429
adviser looks like is having a look at

694
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:41,270
some of the stuff by Charles H green so

695
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:43,429
essentially the reason that we have

696
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,870
grown so fast is we spend a lot of time

697
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:47,150
sitting in listening

698
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:49,149
to our clients to give you one night one

699
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:53,870
example of that which I can share the

700
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:55,910
military one comma so when the military

701
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:59,659
first became our clients they used to

702
00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:04,760
spend you know about eight hundred

703
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:07,340
dollars per site roughly there was a row

704
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:09,440
of about three sites that started

705
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:11,389
applying myself we couldn't really quite

706
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,770
work out and then we found out that it

707
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,150
was this one guy that was going to

708
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,730
different sites and saying hey you

709
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:21,080
should try this thing and he introduced

710
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:22,940
it was really really cool and then he we

711
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,050
spoke to him Annie and we said we've got

712
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,790
some new stuff coming up he said we'll

713
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,889
come talk to us about it

714
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:31,428
Who am I he's spending one and a half

715
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:33,140
thousand dollars so we spent probably

716
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:34,850
about five thousand dollars flying out

717
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:36,950
and we learned what it was they were

718
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:39,379
doing and we improved the tall the last

719
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:44,030
order from the US military single order

720
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:46,040
was 1.7 million dollars so this works

721
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:48,320
listening to what people want and then

722
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,540
making sure that you can build that Plus

723
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,820
what they might need next is how we've

724
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:55,250
grown our company and it's also the

725
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:57,559
easiest way to grow referrals is to do

726
00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:03,710
what you say and deliver on your

727
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:05,000
promises so to smash things I haven't

728
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:07,220
really talked about the running a

729
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,050
business part the how do you measure

730
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:11,990
things and the metrics and everything

731
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:13,550
else the sales are marketing if you

732
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:17,059
don't get that right all of the other

733
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:18,740
things can be almost a moot point but

734
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:19,879
it's amazing how many people trip up

735
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,770
because they don't know how to manage

736
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,390
those things they don't know how to

737
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:26,389
measure their people or how to get the

738
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:29,360
best out of their people so a business

739
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:31,640
framework that is really really awesome

740
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,530
is one called traction and it covers

741
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,750
everything not in detail it's like a

742
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:37,940
buffet of what you might need to run a

743
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:40,250
business but it will help you through

744
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:42,320
ten three and one year planning which if

745
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,490
you want to get an investor and if you

746
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,428
do want to get any investor I'd

747
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:48,260
recommend the best slide deck ever it's

748
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:51,140
like ten slides to how to how to build

749
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:53,179
an investment slide deck it helps you

750
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,710
with streamlining your peoplemetrics so

751
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:56,299
understanding what people are good at

752
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:59,979
and then getting the best

753
00:32:56,299 --> 00:33:02,479
and it helps you manage by numbers so

754
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:03,830
that's so that you're not running on do

755
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:06,499
I like this guy because I went out with

756
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:07,789
pizza last and Joseph fabulous guy and

757
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:11,419
then you find it and actually it hasn't

758
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:14,570
delivered the project so traction is a

759
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:17,629
really great business framework but it

760
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:23,029
doesn't create great managers it helps

761
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:25,549
those managers thrive know the kind of

762
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:28,459
out of time but we I will try and answer

763
00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:31,279
some questions but we will be around and

764
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:32,719
essentially there's the book list that

765
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,320
what the only one that I haven't covered

766
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:38,269
is because that's all about selling

767
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,499
stuff and building a business and how to

768
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:44,899
run it the bit that's about the people

769
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:47,419
is first break all the rules and that is

770
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:51,529
quite honestly one of the best books

771
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:53,570
I've ever read on managing people it's

772
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:58,249
done by Gallup so it's a pollster and

773
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:59,570
they assess out of all of the most

774
00:33:58,249 --> 00:34:01,489
successful businesses and the most

775
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,499
successful teams and the most successful

776
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:05,629
managers within those teams what were

777
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:08,059
they doing and they came up with twelve

778
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:09,949
things that people need in order and the

779
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:12,139
first two are really simple do I know

780
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:13,730
what's expected of me and have I got the

781
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:15,799
tools to do my job and you'd be amazed

782
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,569
how many businesses don't get that bit

783
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:19,159
right oh you might be working for some

784
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:23,538
of them in which case no not amazed at

785
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:25,569
all but anyway thank you very much have

786
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:27,950
we got time for a little question or two

787
00:34:25,569 --> 00:34:31,579
awesome so if you've got any questions

788
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:39,799
of us please feel free to chuck them

789
00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:43,220
this way this way she's program many

790
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:46,779
Kaplan people in my life he could sell I

791
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:49,730
know yes one of them was really charming

792
00:34:46,779 --> 00:34:53,690
you're obnoxious that he was the other

793
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:55,159
one was charming in time yes but I had

794
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,890
lots of trying people give you answers

795
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:01,279
Jim Jimmy to see what it is that they're

796
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:04,009
doing differently yes

797
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:05,690
it's normally in the delivery area so I

798
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:08,359
know a lot of very slick people that

799
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:09,610
then don't deliver and they may get

800
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:11,470
through the door a couple of times

801
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:14,230
but then when you don't get what they

802
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:17,350
promised you then it tends to wear off

803
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:18,850
quite quite fast and there are people

804
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:21,089
that I will go out again and again with

805
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:24,460
for lunch but I will never buy from them

806
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:27,400
so you know just but there's a whole

807
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:29,920
heap of stuff and I'm happy to to cover

808
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,110
that one to one because that's a big

809
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:42,520
thing to unpack any I think there was a

810
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:45,250
question at that so yeah so if you

811
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:48,550
haven't got any customers at all the

812
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:50,530
easiest way to show credibility which

813
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,760
may or may not be possible for you is to

814
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:55,300
show that it does what it says on the

815
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,000
can so if you can do a trial if you can

816
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,980
do a demo type thing if you haven't got

817
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,420
any customers there's something in it

818
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:04,240
for you might be the first reference

819
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,980
site so it may be that you go do you

820
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,290
know what I'm so confident this is going

821
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,430
to work for you that I can see that

822
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:12,370
you're going to have to invest some time

823
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:14,890
to test it with me I will invest my time

824
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:16,810
and product for you for free while we

825
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:18,609
test it and then if you're happy with it

826
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:20,470
in the second year you carry on and pay

827
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:23,110
for it but would you be a reference site

828
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,859
because you know honesty is the best

829
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,360
policy

830
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,550
because at some stage they're going to

831
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:31,120
realize that you're new and shiny you

832
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:33,370
know but that would be a very typical

833
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:53,589
way of doing that providing that you can

834
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:57,009
you can fund it it's that cool bingo

835
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:59,830
great sorry okay so for me I have a

836
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:03,220
notebook so when ideas pop into my head

837
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:04,840
I write them down and I then don't do

838
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,209
anything I'm just kind of brain dumping

839
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,280
into this book and what I do is they can

840
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:11,200
go back and review it later after a

841
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,520
period of time has gone quite often I'll

842
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,279
go yeah that's a stupid idea

843
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:16,960
I live scribbling a whole day but then

844
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,730
there'll be some which actually I'll go

845
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,920
and this is worth investing more time

846
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:22,410
into and

847
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:27,990
going on I think it's worth having that

848
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:29,730
gap just so that you have time to come

849
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:31,919
back down to earth cos sometimes when

850
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:33,990
you have these these things they then I

851
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,370
actually based in the real world and

852
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:38,339
actually that's a really good point

853
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:40,259
because remember the emotional versus

854
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,090
logical that you're gonna have an

855
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:45,060
emotional response to your own idea and

856
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:46,470
think it's brilliant and as you haven't

857
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,750
got a team to stop the groupthink

858
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:51,270
happening you're your own group that

859
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:54,630
that gap very much helps you engage that

860
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:56,370
logical thought processes yeah and it

861
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:58,680
also helps me out as well because I know

862
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:01,109
Nicola spoke a little bit about being

863
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,210
bullied is need with me being what it's

864
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:05,880
kind of I come up with these things that

865
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:08,790
I think a great ideas if I immediately

866
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,260
told her she didn't need big oh well how

867
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:12,029
we're going to do that has I can the way

868
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,550
stuff and then in my head that's a

869
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:17,250
negative thing that then goes may feel a

870
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:19,170
bit sad that I suddenly do so the

871
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:22,730
process of me having a notebook and

872
00:38:19,170 --> 00:39:03,060
writing it all down in there before

873
00:38:22,730 --> 00:39:05,340
actually helps me out as well with you

874
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:07,290
were kind of right and that's what

875
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:09,180
happened with titania because there was

876
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:12,330
nobody else in the marketplace that

877
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:14,339
somebody could go to so people were

878
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:16,470
really forgiving you know if they were

879
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:18,240
like oh this this is weird I wasn't

880
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,740
quite expecting that and they didn't

881
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,629
have anybody to phone so they just

882
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:24,720
worked it out didn't they the kind of

883
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:26,820
did that but the thing is a really good

884
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,629
product does kind of sell itself in if

885
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:32,520
it does what it says on the can and it

886
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,720
meets your needs and it's a adds value

887
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,000
and you've got

888
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,709
cash there of course you'll buy it but

889
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,450
will you buy it the next row in the next

890
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:43,020
row and the next row after that because

891
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:47,460
there's it's not a customer it's a

892
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:50,250
paying prospect so your customer is

893
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:53,070
everybody else's prospect for the thing

894
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:56,010
that is like your thing and if you're

895
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:57,359
not there supporting them and making

896
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,820
sure they get best value out of it

897
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:01,980
somebody will come along and it may be

898
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:05,040
somebody with a shiny disco ball but

899
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:09,630
they're busy talking to them so you're

900
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:11,550
paying prospect maybe lost so yes I'd

901
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:14,970
say you know when when I started up

902
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:16,980
titania I created a website itself but

903
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:19,680
what I thought was useful information on

904
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,720
the website in solids overall and the

905
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,310
first few customers that we had with

906
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,980
people that had used Google and just

907
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:28,440
playing the website and then work back

908
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:30,599
themselves off my techy speak what it

909
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,800
was the product actually did and and

910
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:37,380
then find it useful who came and bought

911
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:39,210
the software I think if we had carried

912
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,700
on doing that what would have happened

913
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:43,140
was someone else but I said well that's

914
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,660
a really neat idea they're doing it

915
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:49,230
badly will create swim it's similar and

916
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:50,970
market it better and then titanium will

917
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:52,530
just disappeared off because we have

918
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:54,118
been able taking muscle one else it's

919
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:59,099
almost like that's happened before B -

920
00:40:54,119 --> 00:41:01,530
max VHS so it so having a great product

921
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:04,560
is great for getting a good start but

922
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:11,910
actually and the marketing needs to come

923
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:14,900
and capture that has been extremely

924
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:18,419
informative fantastic

925
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,419
[Applause]
