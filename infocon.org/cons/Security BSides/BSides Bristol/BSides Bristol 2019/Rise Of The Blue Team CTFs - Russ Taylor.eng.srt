1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:08,480
code so as he said talks about blue team

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,989
CCF's but very quickly I do an

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:15,710
introduction on myself in full geeky

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:17,210
mode as I said I understood currently I

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,980
work for company called helical levity

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,100
it's quite a small consultancy company

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:25,039
but we do work closely with sons who I

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,810
hope a few of you are familiar with we

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,510
are currently working on a cyber

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:32,058
discovery project which is teaching 14

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:34,489
to 18 year olds about cybersecurity

12
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:38,149
skills we have a u.s. program which is

13
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:39,559
just kicked off as well and my job at

14
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:42,199
the minutes to run a team who is

15
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:45,229
developing content building CTF building

16
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:48,349
training platforms for people in that

17
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:50,089
age group prior to that how is it

18
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,249
Leonarda which is had just across the

19
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:55,579
road from here as a stock analyst before

20
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:59,120
that I was in NATO again as a soccer

21
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:01,339
analyst you will notice a pattern I was

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,138
a security consultant again another

23
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:04,908
small consultancy company I prefer the

24
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:06,530
smaller companies to be honest larger

25
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:08,750
companies I find you can become a bit of

26
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:12,530
a grey person in the background so I

27
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:14,420
mostly play the smaller companies this

28
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,270
response analyst ironically then moving

29
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:20,540
to a big company and before that the

30
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:23,420
Airbus defence in space and if I was in

31
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,800
the Royal Air Force and obviously like

32
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,050
most people in this room I was born a

33
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,490
geek

34
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,410
you can save questions as far as I can

35
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,970
ask for out to be honest with the format

36
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,640
we have here I'm quite happy to take

37
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,890
questions either one so we're going to

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,690
discuss a few points I do I'm going to

39
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,050
apologize I don't know many Paulo's my

40
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:43,759
own slides I'm going to and the

41
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:45,320
transitions do go each point which I

42
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,180
know is not particularly popular these

43
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:51,919
days but I'll be honest I don't really

44
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:53,659
care I'm going to talk about why the red

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,790
team's ETS are typically more calm and

46
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:58,370
why blue is under load how to design a

47
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:01,159
blue team's CTF we're going to look at

48
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:03,050
some principles on that good to talk

49
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,170
about how we can overcome some of the

50
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:09,679
common issues that you get examples of

51
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:13,069
why you need a blue team CTF and that

52
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,239
was a last point dummy right next one so

53
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:16,238
red versus blue

54
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,250
in the past we've seen a lot of Red Team

55
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,680
CTS and they're really cool good good

56
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,470
fun but a lot of the time they are very

57
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,210
contrite very much a case of go and find

58
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,450
flag tech sits on the desk top of this

59
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:31,550
machine but you need to kind of go and

60
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,700
find it yourself we put some really odd

61
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:37,310
and obscure blockers in your way and but

62
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,339
just go and have fun and the the

63
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:42,830
forensics side of things were really put

64
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,570
in there more as a filler than an actual

65
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,840
challenge so certainly on some of the

66
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,340
websites I've seen the LC forensics is a

67
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,660
subheading somewhere and then you go and

68
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,360
download a file and it might be an image

69
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:57,200
and you're looking for least significant

70
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,350
bit and steganography or or something on

71
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,070
those lines and there are not very many

72
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:05,840
dedicated luteum CTS so again as I say a

73
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,459
lot of the forensic challenges there's a

74
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,220
lot of proof-of-concept challenges out

75
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:11,930
there which have their uses and can be

76
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,850
quite valuable but at the same time

77
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:17,180
don't represent the mainstream of what

78
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:19,459
forensics and blue team do some of the

79
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:22,640
network protocols that you have to

80
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:24,980
reverse I've seen for example ICS

81
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,750
protocols in use type of things that a

82
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,420
very small minority of the industry will

83
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,470
actually see in use and people asking

84
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,720
questions around that so you have to go

85
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,310
and research how these work and again it

86
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,130
has its uses but it doesn't represent

87
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:42,170
the mainstream kind of stuff we want

88
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:43,670
completed and why is this happening well

89
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,429
traditionally blue tint a bit boring

90
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:48,708
let's face it if you stand of doing blue

91
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,930
team's stuff is great presenting blue

92
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:52,430
team's stuff not so much you know if you

93
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,799
found a new artifact in the Windows

94
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,030
registry nobody cares if you found in

95
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,500
your vulnerability and in you exploit

96
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,420
that sounds really cool people to do

97
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,620
that so what we're trying to do is show

98
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,070
that the blue team's stuff can actually

99
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,750
interesting and can be fun

100
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,760
some of the challenge we have is the

101
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,049
file size it's going to quite large so

102
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,010
if you've got windows box that you're

103
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:15,560
doing the forensics CTF on the image

104
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:17,418
itself for RAM for example maybe one

105
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,930
gigabyte if you're lucky to get it that

106
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:22,609
small and if you get in a Windows disk

107
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,220
image you're talking maybe five six

108
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,150
gigabytes minimum and that's assuming

109
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,710
that you don't have a Windows Update

110
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,599
let's randomly go in the background

111
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,750
which happened to us and push one of our

112
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,320
- 20 gig and obviously trying to

113
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,850
download these is not easy so what

114
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,469
should it look like it should be real

115
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,530
well so I've been happy not about from

116
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:45,100
the first place you should be trying to

117
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:47,330
get things which represent issues a

118
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,440
forensics people or blue team people

119
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:54,320
have come across in the past now the

120
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,300
file sizes are becoming slightly less of

121
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,040
an issue as time goes by obviously our

122
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,930
program deals with schools so they are

123
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,970
very much still an issue because schools

124
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,610
still have terrible internet connections

125
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:07,430
and still have about 40 firewalls with

126
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:11,510
any any rules set between the outside

127
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:13,250
and the school itself there is some

128
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,539
things which we can do to help with this

129
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,250
so there's some developing software

130
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:20,450
which I'll I'll come into in a minute

131
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,560
which can help with this process the

132
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,860
other thing we need to bear in mind is

133
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,810
that having a Linux box as a challenge

134
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,190
is great because it's easy it's free you

135
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,380
can set it up a lot of people are very

136
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:34,550
comfortable enix but the blue bars here

137
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:36,409
actually representing Windows has an

138
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,760
operating system as it's been seen from

139
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,730
the source I grabbed this one which I

140
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,190
can remember what it is and at the top

141
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:45,320
they could see Mac is getting a bit more

142
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,300
Mac coming along and Linux is actually

143
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,480
gray one at the top which is very thin

144
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,390
line so Linux is still a very small

145
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,640
percentage in terms of user land and in

146
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,900
terms of what a forensics personal blue

147
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,690
team person will be doing in their

148
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,150
day-to-day job whereas Windows still

149
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:05,180
takes up the de lion's share of of the

150
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,159
work it is still important to do Linux

151
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,600
don't get me wrong but we need to be

152
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,300
looking at what the limits boxes are

153
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,070
doing and how we represent that are they

154
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,040
a web server are they now your T device

155
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,450
what is it that that box is doing is it

156
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,740
maybe you've been boiled down into some

157
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,830
sort of firewall device that you're

158
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,570
looking at Mac forensics also not

159
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,140
getting enough love right now so if

160
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:30,860
anybody is a bit of a Mac lover Mac Ned

161
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:34,550
by all means bring out some CTFs or

162
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:36,770
Mac's so if you're gonna build the CTF

163
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,090
planning you have to plan the dumb thing

164
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,400
if you don't you'll be very sorry very

165
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,539
quickly so we talking about two

166
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,250
two ways of doing this home and business

167
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,190
the two main avenues we go down with

168
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:50,460
this but you need to plan on both it's

169
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,840
important that you plan the challenges

170
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,210
and then building of structures match

171
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,390
what you want them to be don't build a

172
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:59,969
nympho a bit of an anecdotal story a

173
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:03,479
former colleague of mine he is building

174
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:05,850
a CTF and he said our level once

175
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,470
complete is a sweet I don't remember

176
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,910
seeing any paperwork for level two three

177
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,620
and four which is what is going up

178
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,790
there's no no no you can't build level

179
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,390
two or three or four words at level ones

180
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,950
bill no that's the opposite of what I

181
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,960
should be doing you need to be planning

182
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,000
level one two three and four and looking

183
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,049
at how the various challenges interact

184
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,750
with each other and how you progress

185
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:27,810
through them before you start booting up

186
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:32,010
as your boxes or AWS boxes or even doing

187
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:33,210
VMs try and write down more than you

188
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,640
plan to bill this is important because

189
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,430
what we found is we wrote down ten

190
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,719
steganography challenges and there was a

191
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,370
we don't need tents they cannot be

192
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,590
really boring you put tens ten

193
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:46,890
challenges in there so try and kind of

194
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:48,060
over over plan we have the challenge

195
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:51,120
that you need make sure you get plenty

196
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,280
down on that make sure somebody else

197
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,870
reads them and then the and says yes

198
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,369
that makes sense don't just kind of go

199
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,990
yes oh I think that's cool let's do a

200
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,880
lot of registry stuff for let's do a lot

201
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,920
of memory stuff because you might have

202
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,440
your specialty area and completely

203
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:09,030
neglect network for example or something

204
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:12,000
oil or logs and again plan all the

205
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,679
levels and try and build your difficulty

206
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,140
go back to the story I just told you

207
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,760
where you need to make sure you have all

208
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,080
your levels planned at the beginning and

209
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,060
as you're doing these try and think in

210
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,950
your head how hard is this what steps

211
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,170
are involved and it may be that the peer

212
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,460
review works come back and say no no I

213
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,620
think what you did there is actually

214
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,979
really easy or that's really hard so

215
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,240
make sure that you kind of get your

216
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:38,640
difficulty in there at the at the

217
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:40,200
beginning now this one again is if you

218
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,630
can use the same source of data it can

219
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,640
be really good fun because you can build

220
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,710
one box you can do whatever you need to

221
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,180
do to that box and then start putting

222
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,760
lots of questions in that only is one

223
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:53,569
file to download the only it's much

224
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,089
smaller in terms of physical downloads

225
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,910
and you can kind of build a store

226
00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:03,110
boss the only downside is if you're

227
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:04,850
using flag as your flag so for example

228
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,769
flag : weird

229
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,360
then people can grep without strings

230
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:10,550
that or do other things I accidentally

231
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,920
find flags before they're supposed to

232
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,949
find them so if you are going to do that

233
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,839
don't put flag level 1 question 2 is

234
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:19,399
because some people will just go through

235
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,230
and grep it and then quite happily up

236
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,730
there on all of the data the other way

237
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,759
of doing it is to use things like time

238
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,399
stamps as a flag filenames md5 hashes

239
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,620
things are things that can't be easily

240
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:33,740
searched for so building the CTF at home

241
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:37,399
I built a couple for the cyber security

242
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,959
challenge in the past they've they've

243
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:40,459
gone down in size these days there's not

244
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,170
as much demand to do that type of thing

245
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:44,809
if you are doing from home I would

246
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,069
recommend using a single image because

247
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:46,939
you know you don't have a team around

248
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:48,740
you you're doing everything yourself

249
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:49,939
it's just much easier to keep track of

250
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,779
everything you're doing on a single

251
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:54,920
image build a narrative into the CTF so

252
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:56,990
the ones I've done in the past have

253
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,910
usually been insider threat type ones

254
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,980
because they're kind of fun you can just

255
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:04,279
make stuff up be a little bit out there

256
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,329
with a story Scott and Ledford who is

257
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,709
one of the guys who worked for the

258
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:11,179
challenge I always made him the bad guy

259
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:12,649
because it was fun and that just makes

260
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:13,939
it a little more interesting if people

261
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:15,410
can relate to that they know who the

262
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:16,370
person is and they're like oh yes Scott

263
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:21,620
he's doing something else that's got

264
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:23,420
fine a well system again adding Easter

265
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,269
eggs can be good but make sure the

266
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,920
Easter eggs are relevant obviously and

267
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:29,959
this is another one where you can put

268
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,959
people's names in there so I might have

269
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:35,989
an obscure email in there which is

270
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,189
between Scottie and wanted one of the

271
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,749
other people who work for the challenge

272
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:40,969
which is talk about nothing to do with

273
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:42,529
this competition but it's just fun to

274
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,629
read and it can be just kind of a little

275
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:46,189
conversational thing and it's just thing

276
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:47,509
is these little extra pieces of

277
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:49,040
information that search and look at some

278
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:52,069
information because obviously using a

279
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,719
sanitized imaging what you're doing so

280
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:56,149
what you need to be doing is kind of

281
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,110
rather than trying to emulate user

282
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:02,179
behavior in a normal way is just

283
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,980
contrived user behavior so it is fake

284
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:08,660
you may be talking about something

285
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:09,649
amusing something topical but don't use

286
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,139
real companies

287
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:13,999
of people because with the exception of

288
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:15,170
the obviously the guy I used t knew

289
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:16,790
about it and news

290
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:22,009
I didn't on the first one he found out

291
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:23,329
but it did on the second I just said

292
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:26,980
don't use real companies because they

293
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:26,979
get quite upset about the substance and

294
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:37,790
it can be hard in this out so a business

295
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:39,410
CTF you you need to look at this as a as

296
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,910
what the benefits to the company when

297
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,279
you're doing this you can do a CTF a

298
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,839
recruitment so this would be much more

299
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,939
structured much more formatted and you

300
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:49,429
say that if people score well in this

301
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:50,629
area then we can offer them a job in

302
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:52,160
this if they're particularly weak in

303
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:55,240
this area then that we maybe don't offer

304
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,829
them the job whatsoever brand awareness

305
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,749
events like b-sides or infra Sexson like

306
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:01,339
you can put the CTF on where you know

307
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:04,249
that we people that will be interested

308
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:05,749
in doing the technical challenges and

309
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:10,369
then you're basically said this is our

310
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:12,350
company this is what we can do and again

311
00:12:10,369 --> 00:12:13,910
the Easter eggs will be dictated by

312
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,139
business benefit it depends on whether

313
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,790
or not your company will allow you to

314
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:18,499
have a bit of fun with it I would always

315
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:20,389
push for a little bit of fun with these

316
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:23,749
things because it can become quite dry

317
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:26,059
if you don't and treat like an old

318
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:27,470
business project so don't see this has

319
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:29,449
just been the thing the tech team are

320
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,679
doing see this is being we need to have

321
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:33,319
a project manager on this and you're

322
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:36,139
dead lining up our deliverables the

323
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:42,378
usual things you'd expect from from

324
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:43,999
doing a business project and as we said

325
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:46,009
before some of the emerging software

326
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:49,970
that's coming out which is on a slide in

327
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:52,939
the moment is VNC IDP SSH protocols that

328
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:55,249
work over the top of html5 so you cannot

329
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:56,809
to use your own infrastructure whether

330
00:12:55,249 --> 00:13:00,170
that be cloud whether that be local

331
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:02,120
through a VPN for people to connect to

332
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:06,378
in order to do these these types of

333
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:08,240
challenges so if you are going to host

334
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:09,799
this in something like a do guys these

335
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,410
are some of the tools that you can use

336
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:14,119
guacamole is quite a good one that's

337
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:16,459
been around for a while now I know a

338
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:19,009
couple of companies are using that know

339
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:20,739
VNC and people are seeing botton that

340
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:25,060
people are making their own

341
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:26,950
Forks of this on github and this bottom

342
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,170
one for example is very easy to install

343
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:32,110
it is literally docker image we just run

344
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:34,599
it and you've got the the machine ready

345
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,580
to go what you can then do is with doing

346
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,100
it this way is you put all of your

347
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,780
information either the dock cream is

348
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,960
your onto the edge of grass or as your

349
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:45,310
machine you'll have your image files on

350
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,780
there you'll have your tools installed

351
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,390
on that and they'll give it them out of

352
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,730
resource that you feel is necessary to

353
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:53,650
run that CTF then what that means is

354
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,190
somebody could come along with a MacBook

355
00:13:53,650 --> 00:14:00,130
or Windows box even a Chromebook load up

356
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:02,500
a browser browse to your CTF and take

357
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,030
part so you taking away the idea that

358
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,890
somebody has to have a forensics laptop

359
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,600
available to them a lot of resources

360
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:09,400
you're hosting the resources for them

361
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,260
and you're allowing them to play these

362
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,670
games regardless of where they are in

363
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,810
the world to provide nikka to browser

364
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:18,490
and for and they can browse to your

365
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:20,680
website so examples and ideas for

366
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,450
challenges I do say try and use the

367
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,280
latest version of operating systems and

368
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,530
the reason for this is it prompts other

369
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:30,010
people to do more research insulates

370
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:31,510
operating systems Windows 10 seems to be

371
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:35,319
some sort of weird chameleon that

372
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:36,610
changes on every update memory addresses

373
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,920
changing randomizer

374
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:43,840
Adam loves Windows 10 it keeps his blog

375
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:45,189
going recycle bin forensics does seem to

376
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,530
be quite difficult for new people I

377
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:51,280
quite like this one so on the challenge

378
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:54,100
we created we we put a file a couple of

379
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,510
files into the recycle bin and just

380
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,800
filled in full of junk texture things

381
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,050
all the junk text is the exact same

382
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,160
length except for the flag so I'm sure

383
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,990
if you think it's straight when you head

384
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,339
wouldn't you just strings grep type

385
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,440
thing you can probably filter that out

386
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,000
pretty quickly but so many people got

387
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,770
really upset because we gave them the

388
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,900
file name of the file that had been

389
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:13,030
deleted I would see with the recycle bin

390
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,800
that doesn't work because it changes a

391
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,089
dollar I and dollar R and I forget which

392
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,490
way around it is but one holds a

393
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,710
metadata one holds the actual data so

394
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,790
that you can't find that file name so

395
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,350
you can't just simply look through the

396
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,089
fastest and go I found the file and

397
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,070
people were putting lots of spot tickets

398
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,270
into it and go that's not there you put

399
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,790
the wrong thing in it nope

400
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:33,060
it's working fine you just need to get

401
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:35,199
good as they say

402
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,050
you wouldn't let me say get good I

403
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:41,439
wanted to volume Shadow Copy is another

404
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:42,790
one very good for finding old date I

405
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,980
know you delete something you could go

406
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,779
back to volume Shadow Copy and you can

407
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,190
retrieve the data that had been deleted

408
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:52,139
even in the forensic Lea secured away

409
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:54,550
from the from the more recent stuff

410
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:57,579
registering memory that is quite a fun

411
00:15:54,550 --> 00:16:01,180
one getting people to extract hives out

412
00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:02,439
of memory you can run here on hash bumps

413
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,939
against memory and I'm trying member the

414
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:08,170
plugin and volatility it's gone from a

415
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:09,939
head I know you can pull clear text

416
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:11,349
passwords from memory using a plugin

417
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:12,040
which name I've just forgotten mimikatz

418
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,050
there we go

419
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,180
so many cats plug-in will let you pull

420
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:19,000
clear text password for the windows

421
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:21,040
account from memory you can also write

422
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,490
some really simple Python scripts which

423
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:30,069
will interrogate the registry hive from

424
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:31,569
memory again more files from memory PST

425
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:34,479
files there's no one we did where we

426
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:35,889
said you know the user sent an email and

427
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,370
all we did was provide a memory image

428
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:40,660
and say what was the contact details of

429
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:44,560
this user what was written in the

430
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,880
contact details of this user pickup

431
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,130
challenges because I love me some

432
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:52,149
networking I does we had a whole host of

433
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,829
difficulties from this everything from

434
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:54,579
simply learning to follow a stream in

435
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:57,130
Wireshark

436
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:59,258
all the way through to kind of having a

437
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:01,149
protocol this file transfer which is

438
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:03,339
that teachers netcat says FTP on there

439
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:04,959
but we just jeered at Usenet cup because

440
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:07,870
stripping out the data channel to see my

441
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,520
hard work and this what this does is

442
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:11,979
stop people just using the export file

443
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,599
objects from Wireshark so we kind of

444
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,909
getting people to use out different

445
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,349
tools or different techniques in order

446
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,150
to do the same type of thing that they

447
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:20,379
would do normally and it teaches good

448
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,819
tools because you're not always going to

449
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,500
have Wireshark available to you might

450
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:25,510
end up and find that someone just given

451
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,919
you a Linux box with headless Linux box

452
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,530
where you you've got command line you've

453
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,820
got TCP dump off you go yeah I don't

454
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:33,730
know how to do this because anyone got

455
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:36,428
Wi-Fi and protocol misuse is good fun

456
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,230
and we have many different challenges

457
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:42,429
based on that so another one we've done

458
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:45,860
was to to make how do we do this so the

459
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:49,460
DNS resolve was

460
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:51,320
to lized using binary so it was a name

461
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,090
but each kept a letter represented a

462
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,740
zero or one and then you had to go

463
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:56,809
through extract them all convert it

464
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,830
figure out what the actual flag was from

465
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,379
doing that we've also done the IP

466
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:04,299
address which ended up being an elf

467
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:10,610
binary we had to convert that back into

468
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:11,870
binary really acting like an attacker is

469
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,779
another good way of doing these types of

470
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:16,518
things so you get your box and you hack

471
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:17,870
in and then you kind of look at it

472
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:20,149
afters and go what we've got this is a

473
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,739
little bit more it's a bit less planned

474
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:23,629
than the previous version but can be

475
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,639
more fun in some ways because you you

476
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:27,289
can train your your pentesters to have a

477
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:29,779
bit of fun but also to restrain

478
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:31,700
themselves in what they do to maybe use

479
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:33,740
slightly older techniques or slightly

480
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,269
older tools in order to be detected of

481
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,950
that a little bit easier or maybe you

482
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:38,269
want to go full stealth and see if you

483
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,340
can find it maybe that can be the

484
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:41,929
challenge for not only for you but for

485
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,990
the the people playing your CTF

486
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:48,080
afterwards stealing data is another one

487
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:50,539
you can use us bees emails cloud ones

488
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,029
can be interesting if you think about if

489
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:54,980
you're looking at encrypted traffic how

490
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:57,049
do you know if somebody's dumped

491
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,889
something onto Google Drive on to

492
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:59,389
Dropbox

493
00:18:57,889 --> 00:19:01,820
now you can start looking at different

494
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:03,439
ways of seeing if somebody even access

495
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,210
these sites and then look at hosts

496
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,620
friends it seems anyway of get through

497
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:11,539
those and as I said compromising the

498
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:14,510
machine going through all the different

499
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:17,120
stages as a pen tester and then looking

500
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:20,090
back at it and say what did the what did

501
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,309
the bad guy do on the box so some of the

502
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,658
pitfalls make sure you use a VM do not

503
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:27,379
do this on a live machine you will

504
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:28,210
regret it snapshot and I'm just say that

505
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,399
one more time

506
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:33,139
snapshots often this is something like

507
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:34,969
if you don't snapchat especially if

508
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:37,129
taking memory images if you don't take a

509
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:39,169
snapshot before you install your tools

510
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,669
to grab the memory you're going to

511
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:41,899
contaminate your own memory image and

512
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:43,309
you're gonna have to either reboot it or

513
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:44,870
you have to revert it or do something

514
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:46,908
else but if you've got that snapshot

515
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,739
where you like I've browsed to the

516
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:51,950
website or I've opened the file up do I

517
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:53,210
need to do take a snapshot then install

518
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,090
my tools to take the memory image does

519
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:59,040
it look good yeah

520
00:19:54,090 --> 00:20:00,540
continue just make sure you got up yeah

521
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,020
as I say Windows has some interesting

522
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,730
quirks the windows update as I said at

523
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,700
the beginning change one of our memory

524
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:11,190
just from 16 to 20 gig and our

525
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,050
resolution to that was to wait there's

526
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,030
not much else we could do we just kind

527
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,399
of went it's really big

528
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:19,410
okay leave the machine running walk away

529
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,770
come back oh now it's really small

530
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:25,470
magic suite and Windows just as weird

531
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:27,120
things sometimes defend their updates

532
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:29,340
that in URL to memory images that once

533
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,110
cropped up a couple of times got a

534
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,179
research piece similar to that near the

535
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,070
end but just recently with the u.s.

536
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,680
program was running we give them a

537
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:39,389
memory image the memory image was really

538
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,880
quite simple it wasn't a difficult task

539
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,230
we asked them to do and somebody ran it

540
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,790
through autopsy which seemed a little

541
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,280
bit odd because that was nothing to do

542
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:50,580
with the the challenge at all as a

543
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,290
memory which so bit weird autopsy one of

544
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,960
the things built into it is a basic

545
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,820
regex search which will look for urls

546
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,160
email addresses things like that so they

547
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,980
did a regex I looked at the URLs scroll

548
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,800
down through the 3,500 URLs which is in

549
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:07,170
this clean VM I hasten to add this VM

550
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,149
had been booted up we've done the the

551
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,950
activities to create the artifact took

552
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:13,460
the image shut it down it been up for

553
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:17,400
pension no time at all and they found

554
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,750
references to to porn sites on the

555
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,890
memory image and I said oh my god this

556
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:24,750
is disgusting you're showing this to

557
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:27,270
children's no that was Windows Defender

558
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,550
so what happened is we picked up the

559
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,110
signature pack from Windows Defender and

560
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,639
it got incorporated into the memory

561
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:34,889
image and we had the conversation

562
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,760
internally should we sanitize our memory

563
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:40,530
images but we can't not where we can we

564
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,540
can stick in hex editor and overwrite

565
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:44,190
naughty words with good words but we're

566
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,139
not doing that because that's a lot of

567
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,460
work what we ended up saying was this is

568
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,710
more of a PR issue we need people to

569
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,820
understand that their machines also has

570
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,350
this same date row and this isn't

571
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,439
something we've injected we haven't gone

572
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,899
to inappropriate sites and then kind of

573
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,730
gone haha maybe they'll see that we've

574
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:07,740
this is something that existed in

575
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:10,559
Windows we found with office 365 PST

576
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,880
I didn't want to appear in memory not

577
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,590
entirely sure what happened to this is

578
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,800
office 365 installed by the way not

579
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:18,540
office365 in the browser so one of our

580
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,090
friends at scale she installed office

581
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:23,760
365 message me on slacks unless I can't

582
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,470
find the PST file what you mean you

583
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,559
can't find it's not in memory it has to

584
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,580
be you just opened an email so there's a

585
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,990
bit of research we could have done

586
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,000
beyond that unfortunately that one we're

587
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:34,410
short on time so we actually uninstalled

588
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,559
office 365 and installed an older

589
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:43,320
version wipe FLE so why are these useful

590
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,450
so we've run a blue team CTF in the past

591
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,149
we gave it to the cyber Discovery Kids

592
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:51,059
to look at and they said you've been

593
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,230
looking upon there's one of her in the

594
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:55,889
room was a good point about singing

595
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:57,360
Maris it wasn't there was edit so they

596
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:00,000
said you know you this is erotica that

597
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,979
hit you oh my god you're looking upon so

598
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,170
we've kind of googled it was that a bit

599
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,270
weird than all that is so we've begun a

600
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:07,740
research project which we called Holly

601
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:10,559
pond because Holly was a girl who

602
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,910
created image she was on movies been

603
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:16,110
accused looking pond so we said yeah

604
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:18,870
project Holly pond I'll do so we looked

605
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:22,020
at what ie TLD is which is what the

606
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:23,639
artifact actually said Google came up

607
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:28,170
with best answer on Yahoo

608
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:32,040
she's ie8 creates a indexed data that

609
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:37,740
statement is factually accurate does not

610
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:39,240
help no idea what that means this was

611
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,500
found from a forensic site and I'm not

612
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,440
trying to diss a friend except I won't

613
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,940
say which one it was but the the article

614
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,550
was more just covering in summary

615
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:51,120
there's like a Wikipedia cell summary of

616
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:52,379
that and it said it doesn't know what

617
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,090
it's used for this is like well we don't

618
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,660
have to find out let's do a research

619
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:59,220
project so we responded the windows 7 vm

620
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,050
I said it was clean

621
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,880
we don't need done what we need to do to

622
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:04,889
get the artifacts running and we know

623
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,730
she didn't browse born because well we

624
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:10,410
don't know we just think so erotica that

625
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,940
hate you is never an IP address content

626
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,290
dns tools that we use so we looked at

627
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,000
some of the historical DNS tools

628
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:18,510
couldn't find anything what we did find

629
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,039
is a TLD so you can have something dr.

630
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:23,129
Arata could not hate you if you

631
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:24,899
devisor other entries in the same file

632
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:27,090
in the index dot that file did appear to

633
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:31,939
also be TL DS but not country cotija

634
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:34,259
these just some t others so what is it

635
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:37,679
well you've probably guessed by that

636
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:41,309
internet explorer top-level domains and

637
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,830
as already said created a list of custom

638
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:47,309
TL DS in there and we found that these

639
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:50,759
were also on the Mozilla website on the

640
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:52,889
public suffix so you see in here what

641
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,710
they're trying to avoid is the idea that

642
00:24:52,889 --> 00:24:58,469
you can set a cookie a high level TLD

643
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:00,570
and uncover any website within that TLD

644
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,220
so obviously if it's country code C of

645
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,418
these it's quite easy because the

646
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,460
operating system ID knows what they are

647
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:07,619
it's written in the registry and that

648
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,119
can be done but for these TR these is a

649
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:10,859
little bit more difficult so they put

650
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,840
and the older versions of in the explore

651
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:14,309
it's not on the new version of edge only

652
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,119
the older intake Explorer versions up to

653
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:20,399
Internet Explorer 8 I believe you had

654
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:24,449
this file which defines what TLDs

655
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:26,149
existed in the world so we knew this was

656
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:28,409
there to stop the cookies

657
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:29,879
but it did allow us to find out

658
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:32,099
something which as far as we could tell

659
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:36,349
had not been researched before so this

660
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:38,639
was showing the blue team CTF helped us

661
00:25:36,349 --> 00:25:41,609
soon leave that slide there for a second

662
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:44,248
at a popular yes there you go but proof

663
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:46,049
as to what I'm saying so sorry discovery

664
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:49,799
again as I said this company is the

665
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:53,340
project pre run this over here I really

666
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:54,929
quite liked so which would you prefer to

667
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,889
do blue team or red team the first time

668
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:58,320
we've run this I don't unfortunately

669
00:25:55,889 --> 00:26:00,769
have the stats that was nowhere near an

670
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:04,080
almost 50/50 split so by running these

671
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:06,090
CTFs we're allowing people to really

672
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:11,189
appreciate what blue team or in this

673
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:13,859
case forensics can do so quickly in

674
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,840
conclusion right writing fun CTF does

675
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:18,809
encourage more research simple as that

676
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,399
and the hardest ETF's will allow more

677
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:21,720
tools with alerts and this is important

678
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:23,879
some of the forensic tools that we have

679
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,559
now are great well they could be better

680
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:27,539
and especially more modern opera

681
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,129
operating systems people writing these

682
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:30,720
tools rely on other people to do

683
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,459
research as well as the young research

684
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,149
they do to confirm what they're seeing

685
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,889
is true

686
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:38,228
you can build good games from home

687
00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:42,039
absolutely camp an amazing game some

688
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:44,080
business there is a huge appetite out

689
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:46,179
there for this when we run this the

690
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,830
cyber Discovery Kids Durham a discard

691
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:51,460
server a community discard server it's

692
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:54,489
not one we run and the reactions and

693
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:57,159
there were one whole arias and two

694
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:59,619
amazing so some people were just kind of

695
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:02,649
like forensics I don't want to do

696
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:04,119
that it's hard why am i downloading one

697
00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:05,768
gig just to find out what operating

698
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:06,879
system's been run the night you went in

699
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:08,229
there just kept writing welcome to

700
00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:11,109
forensics every time somebody moaned

701
00:27:08,229 --> 00:27:12,669
about a file size but on the flip side

702
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:14,080
there's a load of people going this is

703
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:15,759
amazing I'm really enjoying this and we

704
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,789
got a lot of people going through in

705
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:21,940
fact only me go back one on here we can

706
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:24,249
see this Detective Constable badge at

707
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,080
the bottom is awarded to anyone who

708
00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:27,549
completes all of level one now our

709
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,408
levels you only have to complete two

710
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:31,570
questions to progress the next level and

711
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:33,729
there's five questions per level so we

712
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:35,649
know a minimum four and a half thousand

713
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:37,089
people completely five questions at

714
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:39,099
level one unfortunate out the stats for

715
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:40,989
every level but I know I'm happy at

716
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:45,999
least that four and a half thousand

717
00:27:40,989 --> 00:27:46,719
people played the first level any

718
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:56,049
questions

719
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:58,330
oh no so what about guys is doing mobile

720
00:27:56,049 --> 00:28:02,440
phone research at the minute and we've

721
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:04,779
got the nice iPhone and androids we are

722
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:08,339
looking at incorporating them but right

723
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:08,339
now we don't have all of our buddies

724
00:28:10,379 --> 00:28:21,449
yeah yeah I think you mean here we go

725
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:24,219
see here I was a bit worried about doing

726
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:27,369
no this one what we ever gotten in

727
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:30,299
trouble so when can I sit it's okay it's

728
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:32,918
an interesting bug after me to the Euler

729
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:34,869
page of page but we have a legal team

730
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,909
and they did not issue the creativeness

731
00:28:34,869 --> 00:28:43,539
well I'm not lying

732
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:44,580
yeah one card in saver Adam Trese shut

733
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:47,499
up

734
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:50,418
any more serious question

735
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:53,179
it's a serious question on that train is

736
00:28:50,419 --> 00:29:02,149
a manual job who loves blue CTS or any

737
00:28:53,179 --> 00:29:03,589
publicly available ones I hate you at

738
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:06,289
the minute no this is kind of the point

739
00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:08,029
of presentation it's not enough really

740
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:09,769
good blue team's ETF's out there are

741
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:11,570
more popping up and I would encourage

742
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:13,399
you to look on the traditional red team

743
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:16,759
CTF websites will quite often have them

744
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:21,018
listed as as weirdo CTF so somehow that

745
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:23,929
they have a category blue team but in

746
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:25,909
terms of dedicated blue CTFs not really

747
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,109
at the bottom zero team I think things

748
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:28,759
every team's a little bit old now but

749
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:30,259
hack the box do quite often refresh

750
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,619
their contents as worth checking in

751
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:35,379
there

752
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:38,629
I think CTF DS site is it CT the IO

753
00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:41,178
they've got they've got a list of CTF so

754
00:29:38,629 --> 00:29:43,428
that you can kind of run from that but

755
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:44,629
they are primarily focused red team so

756
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:46,489
you have to kind of really dig through

757
00:29:44,629 --> 00:29:48,829
find out what's on the blue side and

758
00:29:46,489 --> 00:29:53,859
they'd say oh did I see another handle

759
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:53,859
that's I want more a more questions own

760
00:29:56,349 --> 00:30:07,189
initiative host of images yeah yes I

761
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:08,839
mean do a forensics is definitely on

762
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:10,519
your blue side but obviously blue team

763
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:12,529
can also encompass things that sock log

764
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:14,629
analysis things like that so the blue

765
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:16,369
team fan of is much bigger than just the

766
00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:18,889
forensic side book yeah it doesn't prove

767
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:22,039
it I mean there's also the network on

768
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:23,839
shuffle in the name of malware pack

769
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:26,719
analysis dotnet so you can download a

770
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:29,089
lot of peak apps from there run them

771
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:32,449
through things like Zeke and other tools

772
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:50,329
to try and get to what they're forget

773
00:30:32,449 --> 00:30:52,099
their flights on there one of those feel

774
00:30:50,329 --> 00:30:55,099
free to have a look-see we find there

775
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:59,530
too bit research tweet about it let me

776
00:30:55,099 --> 00:31:00,129
know alright thank you very much

777
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:05,408
you

778
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:05,409
[Applause]
