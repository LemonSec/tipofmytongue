1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:10,080
morning guys I'm Rankin and I'm here to

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,530
present a talk on IOT from an attackers

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,039
perspective so yeah I'm a security

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:21,329
researcher at one of the largest ship

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,730
making companies so I've flown all the

6
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:26,880
way from India just for this conference

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:31,560
so I hope I don't screw this up and have

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:34,890
something of quality so my areas of

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,420
expertise include our web mobile in frog

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,879
code reviews and the regular stuff so

11
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:44,210
the past few years have been performing

12
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:48,928
researchers on linux kernel's

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:52,699
and IOT related stuff ranging from the

14
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:54,530
devices platforms to the applications so

15
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:58,050
yeah

16
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:01,559
the agenda or the takeaways that we can

17
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,110
expect from today's talk is that we will

18
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,929
be able to understand what I 80 exactly

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,080
is and what are the components that are

20
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,400
required to build an IOT solution and

21
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,150
understand what kind of attack surface

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,070
it reveals to an attacker and yeah

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,960
basically that's what we will be looking

24
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:24,360
at today in the interest of time I will

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,059
try to keep this as short or as short as

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,140
possible but in case you find me going

27
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,570
to cast please feel free to interrupt so

28
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,880
the first this is the foothold at this

29
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,850
point of time we can understand from

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,210
this kind of a diagram that IOT have

31
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,559
reached various verticals ranging from

32
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,960
home automation healthcare

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,740
transportation retail and so on and so

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,630
forth so we are pretty familiar with all

35
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,710
these smart devices that we have on our

36
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:58,110
phones so we have dumb devices like

37
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:01,199
coffee makers even our television is

38
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,450
becoming smarter and smarter so they

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,120
call it smart device but I I call it an

40
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,300
entry point for an attacker because all

41
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,250
it does is brew coffee and have an N IC

42
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:16,290
which we shall sit to cry to the

43
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:19,830
Internet so here and IOT is grow

44
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,989
pretty remarkable it's growing pretty

45
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,709
significantly so there if you research

46
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:28,620
out there that suggests that IOT could

47
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:31,200
be a few trillion dollar industry in the

48
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,450
in the coming year so this is a great

49
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,548
space to ventured into right now

50
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:42,690
and make some money so yeah this is

51
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:45,450
another screen slide that gives you an

52
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,609
idea of what kind of components or what

53
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,640
kind of smart devices we have in each

54
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:52,920
vertical so we should be we are pretty

55
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,200
familiar with the home consumer stuff

56
00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:00,089
right so smart security devices and even

57
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,659
the motion sensor that is here I'm sure

58
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,220
it should be working on CB protocol so

59
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:08,790
we should have some hub within this

60
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,709
auditorium or theater so these home

61
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,500
automation or home consumer devices have

62
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:16,560
something that we will we find in our

63
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:20,489
day to day life moving on to transport

64
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,400
and mobility verticals so we find all

65
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:26,760
these autonomous driving or self-driving

66
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,900
cars that are gaining traction a lot of

67
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:34,048
traction these days right so we also I

68
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:37,230
mean vamo is are trying to build a fleet

69
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:39,540
image which is self driving so in the

70
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,030
near future we can find ourselves being

71
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,078
driven to destinations we thought driver

72
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,660
or a chauffeur so that's something that

73
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:51,209
we have to look forward to and

74
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:55,889
healthcare here Healthcare also has a

75
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:58,620
lot of IOT implementations where the

76
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:03,930
patients don't necessarily have to stay

77
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:07,859
in the hospital to get get 24/7 health

78
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:10,440
care so essentially what that means is

79
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:13,010
the patients could have some variables

80
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,380
that that keep monitoring their health

81
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:19,918
that that boils down to home consumer

82
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:22,349
devices as well so as we can as we saw

83
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:25,020
Apple watch the latest version of it it

84
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:28,840
has an ECG built in so they are also

85
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,130
trying to they're also trying to embed

86
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:35,169
that pressure monitors engineer

87
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:39,280
SmartWatch so healthcare healthcare is a

88
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:43,389
huge consumer I would say when it comes

89
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,789
to IOT space and we have smart building

90
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:47,860
smart cities smart buildings yeah we we

91
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:51,190
see all these are temperature sensors

92
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:54,780
motion sensors within within all the

93
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:59,130
buildings that we are huge buildings

94
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:02,789
around these days so that is something

95
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:08,889
that that significantly increases the

96
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:12,669
attack surface so what is IOT ionely is

97
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:17,310
nothing but it is a coalition of various

98
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:23,229
devices embedded devices sensors and

99
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:26,169
applications basically so all of these

100
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:28,449
components work in tandem do it's

101
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:32,109
basically like neatly choreographed

102
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:35,110
dance right so all the all the sensors

103
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:38,590
kind of collect data from the physical

104
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:40,300
world and this data fn2 cloud

105
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,179
infrastructure which is the backend

106
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:47,590
which which goes ahead and process all

107
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:50,460
this data and does the work for you the

108
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:53,859
work can be anything ranging from

109
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:58,270
turning on a light to driving your car

110
00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:01,479
sure to better understand this let's

111
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:05,190
take a look at the Samsung smartthings

112
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:07,630
and architecture so what we can see here

113
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:11,139
there are a bunch of devices right so

114
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:14,110
devices require a language or a protocol

115
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:17,590
to communicate with each other and the

116
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:21,010
hub so the protocols that we can see

117
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:22,179
here are V wave and we'll be using B if

118
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,460
we have a v-mail

119
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,010
or a CB device then these math things

120
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,570
have or essentially they have should be

121
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,700
speaking the same language it should be

122
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,330
able to communicate with the devices on

123
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,930
the same protocols

124
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:38,000
and this hub would essentially be

125
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:40,639
located in the same premises this does

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,159
not have a huge range or something

127
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,789
so whatever data is being collected from

128
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:48,650
the devices are fin sent to the hub

129
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:51,318
which then connects to the internet

130
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:53,299
using a home router so the architecture

131
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,550
that we are looking at is for home

132
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,900
automation right so it connects your

133
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:04,189
home home router and then that data is

134
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:06,229
uploaded to the cloud services so the

135
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:08,469
reason why cloud infrastructure is a

136
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:11,870
huge deal when it comes to IOT is that

137
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:14,270
the embedded devices or the endpoint

138
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,789
devices that we have installed in our

139
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:20,030
homes buildings whatnot so they are all

140
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:22,400
essentially they have a very limited

141
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:25,969
storage the storage that we are talking

142
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,888
about in kilobytes so within that

143
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:29,750
storage it should it should run a

144
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:31,490
bootloader it should run and kernel it

145
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:35,330
should run in an operating system and it

146
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:38,479
should also run an application so given

147
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,370
so due to the description the devices

148
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,770
cannot they usually don't have the

149
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,270
compute power required to process all

150
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,830
the data or all the information that

151
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,219
they collect from the physical world so

152
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:53,889
all that compute power is given to an

153
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:59,089
IOT solution from the cloud service so

154
00:07:53,889 --> 00:08:01,460
yeah and we can also understand from

155
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:05,150
this diagram that these devices can also

156
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:08,299
be controlled by Amazon Amazon's Alexa

157
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:11,719
and Google home the reason why that is

158
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,979
possible is that so they have so there

159
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:15,849
is this thing called a third party

160
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:20,300
integration right so Amazon Google and

161
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:22,400
Samsung have come together and they have

162
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,409
they have opened up certain services

163
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:31,279
that each of them can leverage to

164
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:33,708
communicate with each other and control

165
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,510
the devices essentially so you can this

166
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:38,328
this is also being implemented by

167
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,299
Philips whew it's just not like a

168
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:42,229
Samsung thing or something so

169
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:45,530
essentially what this means is you

170
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:49,100
use your big cell phone or your Amazon

171
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:50,990
Alexa to control any Samsung bulb that

172
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,720
you might have but your home or even

173
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:59,920
their refrigerators and their waters and

174
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:02,950
dryers so - from a convenience

175
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,560
perspective all these home automation

176
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:09,410
solutions come with a smart home smart

177
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:14,000
phone application and also a web

178
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:16,160
interface so even that is a attack

179
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,660
surface when you look at from an IOT

180
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:24,140
solution as a whole so let's dive into

181
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:26,780
each of them in their features right so

182
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,490
yeah these are the IOT components so as

183
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,860
we talked about so there will be a

184
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,150
device it can either be an embedded

185
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,940
device that is placed in your coffee

186
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:36,829
maker or it can be an actual sensor like

187
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:40,460
definition that we have right here in

188
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:42,350
the corner and so each device will have

189
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,820
an operating system so the operating

190
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,120
system that we are talking about is not

191
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,140
an apple - or a Macintosh so it is

192
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,240
something called as a real-time

193
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,490
operating system or commonly known this

194
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,920
are known as Aptos so there are a bunch

195
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:58,100
of real-time operating systems out there

196
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:04,219
like free free are two tiny OS and stuff

197
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:10,130
like that so the IOT OS that they often

198
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:12,620
lack kind of regulation where so what

199
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,790
happens here is that each vendor they

200
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,360
come up with their own operating system

201
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:20,980
and when we take these operating systems

202
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,730
into consideration they lack all these

203
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,920
traditional security measures that

204
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:27,380
mitigations that we have in our OS right

205
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,709
like a SLR DB and so on and so forth so

206
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:33,530
that is something that needs to be

207
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:35,810
addressed and as discussed via mobile

208
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:38,660
application and web interface is still a

209
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,760
huge attack surface in an IOT solution

210
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:44,600
because that is basically how all these

211
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:47,150
devices are controlled and how ya hub is

212
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,630
something that collides the data from

213
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:54,980
all the devices and so hub is

214
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:56,180
essentially proxy which which which

215
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,750
takes the require

216
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:02,719
from the user and sensitive to the

217
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,190
devices and vice versa it also collects

218
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,600
data and send the information back to

219
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:12,350
the user so of course I an IOT physician

220
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:14,420
hugely depends on communications so the

221
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:17,870
communication protocols may range from

222
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:21,050
ZigBee free wave bluetooth to your

223
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:23,420
regular Ethernet cable and yeah cloud

224
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:28,279
infrastructure is pretty pivotal in an

225
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:31,160
IOT solution so moving on to the

226
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:35,480
security perspective of an IOT solution

227
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:38,600
the CIA triad stays true here and this

228
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,550
is this is basically the pillars of

229
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,670
security even when it comes to an IT

230
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:48,290
solution so confidentiality the state of

231
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:50,630
being secret is ok so as we discussed

232
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,060
earlier smart devices are present

233
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:56,120
everywhere right so we have security

234
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:59,300
cameras around our homes and we have all

235
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,820
the fencers laying around for example if

236
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,770
you take Amazon echo it has a webcam it

237
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,839
has a camera built-in right so we may

238
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:10,189
have them in our bedrooms and we're not

239
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:12,050
so that is something so whatever data or

240
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,760
whatever video feed it is getting it is

241
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,890
capturing should should remain

242
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,700
confidential and it should only be

243
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:23,270
accessed by the product owners who I

244
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:27,320
mean the device owners and that is a

245
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:29,540
huge if this is breached then there's a

246
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,060
huge privacy violation right so

247
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:36,290
confidentiality is pivotal

248
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:37,880
so as integrity so integrity is the

249
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:40,250
state of being unmodified by an author

250
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:45,020
edit and unauthorized entities right so

251
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:48,200
if we have the security system in our

252
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:50,900
home so we only want us to be able to

253
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,510
unlock the door and not anyone else so

254
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:56,420
that is something being addressed by the

255
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:58,279
integrity of the solution availability

256
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,899
is just a state of being available so if

257
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:01,670
we have all these devices and if they

258
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:06,589
don't respond to our commands they are

259
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:08,630
no good to us so moving on to the attack

260
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:09,170
vectors there are three attacked with

261
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,839
tears

262
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:14,360
similar okay this is not similar so

263
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:18,110
political is something that gets add-on

264
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:20,630
added on to IOT solution so physical

265
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:23,630
attack winter is where and an attacker

266
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:26,930
routine would require physical access to

267
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:29,810
the hardware itself so this essentially

268
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:32,000
means that okay the kind of attacks that

269
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:35,089
fall into this category are like getting

270
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,329
a root shell on the device itself and

271
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:41,420
offloading data from the devices local

272
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:44,689
network is something where the attacker

273
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,490
needs to be on the local network or your

274
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:50,600
home network when it comes to home

275
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:52,490
automation to carry out these attacks so

276
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,029
remote is the holy grail of attacks here

277
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:58,160
where an attacker essentially carries

278
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:07,189
out the exploit from halfway across the

279
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:10,069
globe so this is a brief list of attack

280
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:13,730
surface that gets opened up when an

281
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:16,970
ideal solution is introduced anywhere so

282
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:20,510
ranging from your industries to basic

283
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:23,810
home automation so yeah we can see that

284
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:25,970
device hardware device firmware device

285
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:29,680
memory or rather hardware and firmware

286
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:32,930
are a pretty unique to one IOT solution

287
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:38,149
and device memory local storage

288
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:39,890
operating system they remain across I

289
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:42,140
mean they remain the same right so we

290
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:44,300
find this even when it comes to our

291
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:47,750
mobile applications right so software

292
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,849
update mechanism is also a new is also a

293
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,640
new attack surface that IOT opens up

294
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,560
network communications web interface

295
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:58,519
mobile application cloud in front third

296
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:04,089
party integration are basically similar

297
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:04,089
to what we do in our day-to-day pen test

298
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:13,220
so what if a device device as we

299
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:17,899
discussed earlier could be an embedded

300
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:19,520
device that is in in any dumb device

301
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:23,210
like your refrigerator

302
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,800
washers and so on and so forth so what

303
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:29,930
an embedded device will essentially have

304
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:33,979
a minimal processor it will have a small

305
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:35,449
and NAND flash storage we are not

306
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,990
talking about megabytes or gigabytes

307
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:42,350
here it's odd it's basically in

308
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:45,770
kilobytes so that is an embedded device

309
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:48,230
and sensors can range from anything

310
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:50,900
anything from motion to a temperature

311
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,180
sensor motion sensors are pretty

312
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,699
prevalent in buildings and proximity

313
00:15:53,180 --> 00:16:02,089
sensors as well and temperature sensor

314
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:03,670
is where you saw something where that is

315
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:08,060
mandatory when it comes to your

316
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:11,900
thermostat control and yeah basically

317
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:14,510
that and hubs as we discussed hubs are

318
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:18,110
required to offload the data to cloud

319
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:19,670
servers and this is the only mode to

320
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:23,540
communicate with the devices because

321
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:25,849
they they communicate in a custom

322
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:30,040
protocol which and none of the mobile

323
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,040
devices can at this point of time so

324
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:39,469
moving on to device security to carry

325
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:43,460
out a physical attack you wouldn't

326
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:46,450
require physical access right so the

327
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:49,490
physical access means that you need to

328
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:52,700
connect to the board via any one of

329
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:58,040
these debug ports it can be a JTAG you

330
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:59,150
are SPI I or I squared C so DS debug

331
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,750
ports

332
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:06,980
could be found pretty easily but in a in

333
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:08,930
a production or in a secure device you

334
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,450
will you may not find all these pins out

335
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,460
in that case you will have to manually

336
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:16,100
go ahead and identify those pins and

337
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:19,190
solder on those to the board and then

338
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:22,490
connect connect your system to those

339
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:25,010
goals so if you can see that a red ring

340
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:28,310
kind of thing so that's what a JTAG pin

341
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:31,910
looks like often what happens is the

342
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:36,360
JTAG has made I mean the board mentions

343
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:39,420
it to be a JTAG there will be a

344
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:43,110
spring written FJ tag it can be JTAG

345
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:46,290
easy tag on what not so J tag is

346
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:48,840
something that you can use to connect to

347
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:52,950
the board itself this is how you will be

348
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,840
you will be able to get Coon shells on

349
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:59,490
the devices and so on and so forth

350
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:01,649
so lack of or TLS that it speaks for

351
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,480
itself right so any kind of

352
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:07,950
communication if it is not encrypted can

353
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:10,430
easily be captured by an attacker and

354
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:15,210
they can easily eavesdrop on it and

355
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:16,800
missing security patches yeah so any

356
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,560
kind of device

357
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,180
I mean breaches happen every day so I

358
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,100
mean no one no one can call their

359
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,040
product completely secured so breaches

360
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:28,580
do happen and when a when a researcher

361
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,629
comes ahead I mean come forward and

362
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,510
discloses that vulnerability it is up to

363
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:38,880
the OEMs to go ahead and bastard

364
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:43,520
vulnerability and send OTA updates so

365
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:47,040
and we can find a lot of small companies

366
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,960
that that that revealed that launched

367
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:53,250
products and basically don't offer

368
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,410
support they work more on updating or

369
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,870
upgrading their hardware rather than

370
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:01,740
sending updates to their current

371
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:03,330
hardware so that is a huge gap there is

372
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:10,860
a huge security gap when it comes to

373
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:14,520
security patches and so yeah in a case

374
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:17,189
that you if you don't have if you don't

375
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,500
have from where with you which is the

376
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:23,910
case when it comes to security

377
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:25,290
researchers so if you have to extract a

378
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,960
firmware from the device you need

379
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,879
something called as a bus pirate that is

380
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,950
the red color boat that you can see on

381
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,470
the top right corner so you can use that

382
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:37,710
to connect to the board that you would

383
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:41,520
like to offload or extract the firmware

384
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:43,310
from and so the pink color board is

385
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,270
something called as a Jetta you later

386
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:50,120
jtagulator something that one can use to

387
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:53,090
connect their laptop to the device that

388
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,590
they are testing so this is how you

389
00:19:53,090 --> 00:20:00,110
would be establishing a connection

390
00:19:54,590 --> 00:20:02,480
between the PCB and your computer so to

391
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,909
usage a tack you later all you need to

392
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,580
do is connect the jtagulator to your

393
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,440
laptop via USB and it comes with a

394
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,960
dongle kind of thing which plugs onto

395
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,280
the board and you'll have to connect the

396
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:18,980
other end of it to the JTAG pins of the

397
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:22,870
PCB that you are testing all you need to

398
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:25,480
do here give the imported that's

399
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:29,870
basically it so you'll have to identify

400
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:32,420
the pins like the B Fifi ground rx T X

401
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:35,209
and stuff like that so generated or

402
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:37,790
something it takes to do all those

403
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,550
things for you if not you can also use

404
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:42,830
something called as a logic analyzer

405
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:46,190
logic analyzers tend to be a little on

406
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:48,590
the pricey side but yeah they do a

407
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:51,830
pretty decent job in letting you know

408
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:55,100
what what each pin does so if it is a 5

409
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:56,570
volt if you see and it will also tell

410
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,520
you I'll let you know which is the

411
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:01,250
transmission pin and with just a

412
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,620
receiving pin so that makes your life

413
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,420
easy so these two are just an example I

414
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,129
mean you don't officially have to use

415
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,920
the same device you could there are a

416
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:14,390
bunch of other devices that a researcher

417
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:16,730
could used to accomplish these tasks so

418
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:18,740
yeah you would require a lot of jumper

419
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:24,800
cables you connect these boats to the

420
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:28,730
PCB and yeah if you are not able to

421
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:31,040
identify the ground and be 50 then you

422
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,660
will have to go ahead and grab a wood

423
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,600
meter and you'll have to figure it out

424
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:37,340
yourself and as we discussed if there

425
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,959
are no prints then you will have to take

426
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,740
out your solving equipment and solder

427
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,950
all the pins onto the boat

428
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:50,300
so yeah how can the hardware be

429
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:52,600
compromised so these are okay we can see

430
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:55,190
the device you can see a bunch of

431
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:57,709
vulnerability here like both

432
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,200
shall be experiential security defaulter

433
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:02,420
blank passwords in secure storage of

434
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,910
root passwords and stuff like that so

435
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:10,030
what happens here is a lot of devices

436
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:16,970
what they didn't do is they okay already

437
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:19,129
I have to become one okay so what

438
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:22,580
essentially happens here is that if you

439
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:24,620
connect we are you at or JTAG bones then

440
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:27,760
if you are if you are doing it for the

441
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:30,830
first time then a lot of devices let you

442
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:34,790
indirectly and they don't even ask for

443
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:37,490
any password or anything and certain

444
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:39,379
devices what they do is they let you go

445
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:41,110
ahead and set the password if you are

446
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:44,180
using it for the if you are connecting

447
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:46,100
those devices for the first time of

448
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,360
course I mean when we bring a smart

449
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,669
device into our home we don't

450
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,310
essentially go and remove the cover and

451
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,840
connected to our laptop side so if an

452
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:57,530
attacker walks into your home they can

453
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:00,020
easily open up the device and connect

454
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,389
connect it and have a shell access and

455
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,160
what they can do from here is dick they

456
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:07,600
could essentially he pop a backdoor on

457
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:10,040
it and that that's a very easy way for

458
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,770
any attacker to get back into your home

459
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:16,610
network at any at any given point of

460
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:19,040
time so as we discussed extracting

461
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:20,810
device firmware is something that is

462
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,629
very important when it comes to an i/o

463
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:26,659
dissolution right so okay let's discuss

464
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:27,850
about firmware in the next slide and all

465
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,230
this we want to look out for

466
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:36,169
misconfigured all or one durable

467
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:39,410
services okay device firmware is

468
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:45,230
essentially okay we can compare a device

469
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:47,810
firmware to your jar files in an android

470
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:50,980
application so firmware is something

471
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:54,800
that contains all the services and

472
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:57,290
whatnot so if you are able to dump the

473
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,550
firmware from a device and and if you

474
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:02,090
are lucky enough to find that your

475
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:03,700
permit not to be encrypted then yeah you

476
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,470
can basically do whatever you want and

477
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:08,419
you've got you could look for

478
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:11,360
any kind of accurate credentials you

479
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:15,769
could look for any doorman service which

480
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:19,309
you could activate and one more

481
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:20,929
interesting thing is that okay whenever

482
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:24,470
a firmware is being flashed on to a

483
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:26,929
heart or whenever permits being flashed

484
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:30,710
on to a device there should be a

485
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:33,440
signature validation but often times you

486
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,120
will not find that happening all the

487
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,789
time so what you could do is you could

488
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,539
you could modify the firmware you could

489
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:43,009
create a militia premiere of your own

490
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:46,730
version and you could just write it

491
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:48,190
flash it onto the device and these are a

492
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:51,259
bunch of tools that you could use to

493
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:53,230
analyze the firmware liftoff which is

494
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:56,419
been work so been working something that

495
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:57,830
helps you to extract a disc worshipers

496
00:24:56,419 --> 00:25:00,440
and the route Efes are basically the

497
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:03,559
file systems from the firmware so the

498
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:06,049
firmware essentially is a dot pin file

499
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:09,019
which you cannot you cannot read

500
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:11,830
directly like using cat or wim so you

501
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:15,649
will have to extract the data from the

502
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:18,889
binary and of course you will require a

503
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:21,649
lot of debuggers and what to do here

504
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:24,610
yeah one thing the first thing that you

505
00:25:21,649 --> 00:25:26,809
have to do is I check for encryption and

506
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:30,529
yeah extract the firmware and do that

507
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:32,779
right so go into the file systems look

508
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:35,720
for any hard-coded credentials

509
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:38,120
you could also interestingly if you come

510
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,639
across some I mean I should not say that

511
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,860
but if you come across some Chinese

512
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:44,120
Hardware oftentimes you will find some

513
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,580
kind of a back door or something I mean

514
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:50,678
which may not be unintended but yeah you

515
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:53,529
may find a lot of those those things and

516
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:56,570
yeah so also look for encryption

517
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:58,970
algorithm so if you find any hard coded

518
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:03,019
keys there then you could basically

519
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:05,210
compromise the communication all the TLS

520
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:07,940
basically and sensitive information

521
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:12,830
sensitive URLs as well you could you

522
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:16,610
could find the admin endpoints or any or

523
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:18,830
any sensitive endpoints to the API is

524
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,479
that they expose

525
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:23,800
you could also look for vulnerable

526
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,800
services and so on and so forth

527
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:29,810
moving on to device memory and local

528
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:31,730
storage as we discussed earlier an

529
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:35,659
embedded device would have limited

530
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:37,880
storage because of which due to the all

531
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,850
major majority of devices tend to have

532
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:44,660
an SD card so if the card is something

533
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:47,060
that the devices rely on to obtain the

534
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:50,240
firmware and flash it onto the device so

535
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:52,850
the firmware directly does not go into

536
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,930
the device it gets downloaded to a nifty

537
00:26:52,850 --> 00:27:00,230
car and then get flashed onto the device

538
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:04,910
so you could you could kind of perform

539
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:07,100
mi TMI tag here and control what kind of

540
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:10,880
firmware goes into the device and flash

541
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:14,659
storage as we discussed so there is a

542
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,670
technique where you could we had you

543
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:21,170
could leverage the non storage you could

544
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:23,390
just short out a few pins and you could

545
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:25,490
basically bypass the boot and I mean

546
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:28,250
that that that makes the bootloader to

547
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:30,820
fail and it'll give you a root shell on

548
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,960
the hand on the device itself so

549
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,010
volatile or non-volatile memory is

550
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,380
something that you will definitely have

551
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:40,420
to look at during runtime and after

552
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:44,510
after the device is closed oh my god

553
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:46,340
okay so also be on the lookout for

554
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,790
sensitive product information and so on

555
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,790
and so forth

556
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:54,380
IOT security is not just hardware

557
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:57,110
security I think we should be able to

558
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,780
understand this by now so okay operating

559
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:02,240
system as we discussed so real-time

560
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:04,940
operating systems is something which is

561
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,690
fairly new to the industry and due to

562
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:10,970
this Duty art was being fairly new they

563
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:15,260
do not have a majority of operating

564
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:20,060
system level security mitigations like a

565
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:23,450
SLR for example and because our toes are

566
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:27,350
- because of the operating system like

567
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:30,830
in a 64 KB size you you it's very hard

568
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:32,240
to extract kernel from the arctos itself

569
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:34,820
so water

570
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:38,240
essentially if it is a fugitive version

571
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,980
of your bootloader your kernel your

572
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,920
operating system and the application

573
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,720
itself that drives the device so if

574
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,690
you've calls you can use something

575
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,050
called as a fifth caller two of the

576
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:53,630
system calls that particular artists

577
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:55,669
uses if it isn't if it is based on a

578
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:57,650
Linux kernel if not then you'll have to

579
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:59,809
write your own reserve treating is also

580
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:02,570
something similar to scholar it is a

581
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:06,710
little little easier to use and more

582
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:08,270
versatile and what to do here yeah if

583
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:12,920
initially next kernel then you could go

584
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:16,420
ahead and try to exploit any known

585
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:22,179
colonel exploits and also look for

586
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:22,179
misconfigured operating system services

587
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:29,929
so this is something that okay go ahead

588
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:33,110
software update mechanism as we okay so

589
00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:37,429
this is something so software update or

590
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:41,899
a firmware update if something is itself

591
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:45,040
a huge gap here because the thing is if

592
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:50,059
you are able to if you are able to

593
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:51,320
bypass these okay if there is no signal

594
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:53,420
validation being done

595
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:59,419
you could easily flash your malicious

596
00:29:53,420 --> 00:30:01,610
form a right and if it's more okay

597
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:04,640
network communications these are the

598
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:07,669
various communications communication

599
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,970
protocols that IOT uses at this point of

600
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:14,840
time which are pretty prevalent so Wi-Fi

601
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:20,420
if it be via Bluetooth NFC MQTT and so

602
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:23,240
on and so forth to to play around with

603
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:25,580
the network communications you would

604
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,309
require some custom devices like a

605
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:31,520
hacker of one and the uber tooth one is

606
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:34,730
the device that is shown in the right

607
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:37,340
corner so hacker of one is basically

608
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:41,030
used to capture any kind of radio

609
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:44,060
frequency signal so it can capture

610
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:46,970
anything from your Wi-Fi signal to

611
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:49,760
GSM and uber tooth one is used to

612
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:53,240
capture your Bluetooth communications

613
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,980
and from a software standpoint then you

614
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,050
would require a Wireshark to capture the

615
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,800
packets why I shot this pretty versatile

616
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:03,290
right it lets you capture anything from

617
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:05,840
HTTP to MQ Tyrian what not eater kappa

618
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:07,909
the hitter camp is also a really great

619
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,949
tool when it comes to packet capturing

620
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:12,560
and GNU radio is something that you

621
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:15,230
would require to I mean GNU radio

622
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:20,419
basically paid appears with the hacker

623
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:22,070
of to capture the data so what to look

624
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,110
for in a network communication is that

625
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:26,000
always look for unencrypted data and you

626
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:30,439
will definitely find a lot of traffic

627
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,200
that is not encrypted MQTT these days it

628
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,570
is getting encrypted but if you are able

629
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,060
to find an older device that uses

630
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:40,159
impunity you definitely find the data

631
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:43,190
not to be encrypted and there is an

632
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:45,020
issue with MQTT where MQTT connect

633
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:48,440
command whenever the impurity current

634
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:50,690
command is run it sends out username and

635
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:54,950
the password along in that in that

636
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:56,930
request in that request so that is

637
00:31:54,950 --> 00:32:00,830
something that you should be on the

638
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:02,870
lookout for and so yeah map out the data

639
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:05,750
flow basically just to understand what

640
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:08,600
kind of data is being sent back and

641
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:11,600
forth from the device and protocol

642
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,159
fuzzing is really important so I mean if

643
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,300
you are using the custom protocol then

644
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:18,190
you should definitely go ahead and

645
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:20,780
perform protocol fuzzing to identify any

646
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:22,190
vulnerabilities within that so moving on

647
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:25,220
to vapour mobile application so it is

648
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,780
our home turf right so web applications

649
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:29,570
for mobile applications have been out

650
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:33,680
there for quite a few years or rather a

651
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:36,649
decade now and we we basically know what

652
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,620
to look out what to look for in a web

653
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:42,350
application or mobile application and

654
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:43,550
these being the okay these being okay

655
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:46,969
maybe application and mobile application

656
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:50,510
is something these applications are the

657
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:54,350
entry points to any of your solution and

658
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:56,929
this is where you you get the data

659
00:32:54,350 --> 00:33:01,459
this is where you live how you send your

660
00:32:56,929 --> 00:33:06,740
commands as well so yeah we know this

661
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:11,870
and I think we just four d4 credential

662
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:14,120
is an encrypted communication logic okay

663
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,799
infrastructure this is something that we

664
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,199
discussed earlier so when it comes to

665
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:20,929
huge enterprises then we really don't

666
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:24,580
have to worry about cloud infrastructure

667
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:27,919
but still and in the recent past we we

668
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:29,678
did have been preachers to Apple cloud

669
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,850
services and things like that so

670
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,500
relatively speaking of relatively

671
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:37,879
smaller companies they tend to not have

672
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,850
all the security medications in place

673
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:43,250
and they even don't have a proper orders

674
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:46,120
going on on their back-end servers so

675
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:49,549
that is an easier way for an attacker to

676
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:52,250
get into the IOT solution so it doesn't

677
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:54,320
it doesn't really impact a home

678
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:56,419
automation system but this plays a vital

679
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,129
role in becomes shown industry in an in

680
00:33:56,419 --> 00:34:01,340
an IND of failure you tease a kind of a

681
00:33:58,129 --> 00:34:05,299
situation third party interaction this

682
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:07,970
is something that a new attack surface

683
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:11,300
when it comes to an i/o definition this

684
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:14,300
is where I mean Samsung Google and

685
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:18,220
Amazon tries to work to work together

686
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:21,290
work in tandem shared their data and

687
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:23,449
okay this in a similar fashion when it

688
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:25,810
comes to huge enterprises then you don't

689
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:28,250
have to worry about it that much but

690
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:30,049
while compared to a relatively smaller

691
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:33,829
company when it comes to a smaller

692
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:36,829
company the odds were that the third

693
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:39,550
party or the data being shared is not

694
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:41,750
particularly restricted right so

695
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,639
unintentional data leaks are something

696
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:50,079
that you could find very easily very

697
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:51,950
easily and code review something that is

698
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,639
really important when it comes to an

699
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:58,220
ideal solution a proper a proper rundown

700
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:00,900
of the total source code base is really

701
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,970
important here you

702
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,460
to perform the KO tribute to plug all

703
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:06,930
the all the all the security

704
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,510
vulnerabilities because this is the

705
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:11,240
easiest way to identify any security a

706
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:13,529
shortcoming

707
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,950
so yeah security is not a strip by the

708
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:18,869
process so you will have to keep

709
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:21,029
researching for vulnerabilities and

710
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:23,250
releasing patches for all the identified

711
00:35:21,029 --> 00:35:25,109
vulnerabilities because let's face it

712
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:27,210
the breaches is something breach is

713
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:28,828
something that happens every day and we

714
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:32,010
will have to there is no other way to

715
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:34,260
get around it but to activate and fix

716
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:36,270
sixty vulnerability and send out patches

717
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:40,250
so yeah thank you for bearing with me I

718
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:43,339
you know I have been really fast and I

719
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:45,600
couldn't cover most of it but yeah I

720
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:50,440
will be happy to take any

721
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,440
[Applause]
