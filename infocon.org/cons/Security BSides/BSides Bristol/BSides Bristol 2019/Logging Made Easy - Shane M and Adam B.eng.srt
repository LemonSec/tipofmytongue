1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,830
well first of all thanks for thanks for

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,719
coming to this talk I know it's a quite

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,879
late on a Friday after lots of dominoes

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:15,690
and the lights are down so thanks for

5
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:18,420
thanks for coming so I am Shane Mallya

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,460
I'm a NCC security architect and I

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,290
specialized in security monitoring

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,300
advice and guidance to our customers and

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,840
Adam I'm another security architect for

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,039
the NCSC

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,080
where I don't really specialized

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,140
anything about you to help Shane on this

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,820
project and I've missed a lot he's done

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,550
all the videos you see later not to give

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,760
it away ok so how do we get here let's

16
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,860
stop a bit of background you might have

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,199
seen this before some from the National

18
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,820
Cyber Security Center and this is our

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,950
mission statement so we try to kind of

20
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,660
raise the watermark across the UK to try

21
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,809
and protect people from cyber attacks

22
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,929
and as I say I kind of focus on that

23
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,699
security monitoring angle and it'll

24
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,649
become a little bit relevant but you've

25
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,340
got understand this understand why we've

26
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,600
designed

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,140
LME in the way it is because we've got

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,869
some constraints we've got to work under

29
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:09,119
so I bet a customer's quite often and

30
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:10,200
there's often the question about why why

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,549
do we log in and monitoring why do

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,889
detect and this is kind of my little

33
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,780
soapbox at the moment which is a lot of

34
00:01:13,889 --> 00:01:18,149
time I see in industry we have in this

35
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,409
framework so it's kind of nicely split

36
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:21,959
up the activities into the different

37
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,520
quadrants and the reality is that we

38
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,139
often do to protect a lot more than the

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,658
detector kind of operational security

40
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:29,850
and I think that there needs to be a bit

41
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,079
more of an equal not necessarily 50/50

42
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,869
split but there needs to be more effort

43
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,130
on the kind of the tech side which is

44
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,079
good because all the previous talks

45
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,130
today mainly been around sort of things

46
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,469
like threat hunting and have to run

47
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,908
assault which is really good to see but

48
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:43,380
I think this is kind of this situation

49
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,090
we're in at the moment which is why I

50
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,068
kind of spend a lot of my in about two

51
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,200
or three years now looking specifically

52
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:55,349
at the kind of monitoring side of of

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:57,569
work so we get different asks from from

54
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:59,159
our customers but basically when people

55
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:00,539
come to me they say I get emails I'm

56
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,859
like probably about a monthly basis now

57
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:03,869
from a different government department

58
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:05,189
and it's all often just like we need a

59
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,569
sock like where do we start we going to

60
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,708
outsource it we need to make it slightly

61
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:09,390
better than the current years and

62
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:11,250
there's something on a scale between the

63
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,799
left hand side of like we just don't

64
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,640
have any logs or do anything at all all

65
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,260
the way to like I really want to get to

66
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,809
right which is like the NSA sock you

67
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,780
know that kind of Minority Report shiny

68
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,850
glass room obviously nobody really gets

69
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,170
their reality but I try and help them

70
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,910
come somewhere along that's a

71
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:31,929
proportional way to get to where they

72
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:33,190
need to be for their organization so

73
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,750
give them that kind of context how how

74
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:38,980
can NTC help so I wrote this guidance

75
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,870
called instructions and logging for

76
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,160
security I think it's actually supposed

77
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,430
to be security monitoring purposes is a

78
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,980
nice little mouthful that basically

79
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,080
looks at the outcomes you might want to

80
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,238
achieve ice-pop your monitoring so it

81
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,410
has a bunch of potential questions you

82
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,720
might be asked during an incident

83
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,090
because this is mantra of like blog

84
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,820
everything and that's cool but really I

85
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,019
guess it would be nice to think if if

86
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,570
you have an incident that somebody comes

87
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,400
to you and says which machine made this

88
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,739
DNS query who was logged in at that time

89
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,269
that kind of stuff if you think about

90
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:11,769
that in advance of the situation and

91
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:13,989
then collect logs around that so you can

92
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:16,150
accurately detect and answers questions

93
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:17,320
that's what this guidance document does

94
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,330
it's got a table in there and kind of

95
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,130
prompts you a bunch of questions so this

96
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,230
is one of our leaders I guess is NCRC

97
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:27,130
we pull call quite often which is

98
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:29,320
guidance and advice on our website prior

99
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,000
to this as things like GPG thirteen I'll

100
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,459
mention out for people who are taking

101
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,450
the bingo thing but unfortunate um he's

102
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:39,610
already won it so I'm for unlucky and

103
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,018
also as I mentioned earlier I do kind of

104
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,510
that face to face consultancy of a lot

105
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:45,430
of customers the other way we help is

106
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,560
act what we call active cyber defense

107
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,049
which is kind of services we provide

108
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,030
free full point-of-use to government

109
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:53,829
departments so probably the most

110
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,540
well-known is protective DNS service

111
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:57,850
which is effectively we'll sinkhole

112
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,890
known bad the mains if you want your

113
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,480
your service to it as a government

114
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,130
department but will actually you know

115
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,298
with kind of doing the full whole thing

116
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,390
there where we offer you the service in

117
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:09,400
trying to stop the attacks happening so

118
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,440
looking made easy kind of fits in

119
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,609
between rules to kind of leave as you've

120
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,690
got a guidance advice which is like

121
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:15,160
think about these principles and going

122
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:18,279
to it and then this like we'll just do

123
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:22,169
this for you this is about helping you

124
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:25,289
help yourselves so can't we got a way to

125
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:27,880
help people do logging which is pretty

126
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:28,650
general across the set of you know that

127
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,270
particular

128
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,799
etc a particular environment and that's

129
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,570
kind of where looking at Made Easy comes

130
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,389
in so we've aimed it at small

131
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,889
organizations they've got no explain Oh

132
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:39,479
looking at the moment they've got no

133
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:41,490
budget that you know so it has to be

134
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,740
free and open source no tools you know

135
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,000
no cost for tools they've got like

136
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,990
limited effort they don't really know

137
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,680
what to start the vendor the

138
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,630
configurations they should be loading so

139
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,870
so loading made easy as effectively it's

140
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:56,340
a very detailed set-up guide plus a

141
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,780
bunch of things like group policy

142
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,280
objects scripts things that actually

143
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,239
help you also configure parts of the

144
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:06,989
steps so I've got logging made easy in a

145
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:10,560
slide so this is right so as I sort of

146
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:13,260
said earlier it's aimed at the windows

147
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,880
estates we're saying for small

148
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,770
organizations so it's kind of around

149
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,130
about 250 Windows machines client

150
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,570
machines and what we do is we avoid you

151
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,250
to drop system on down on those machines

152
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:26,039
and we give you things like patch files

153
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:28,470
to run as a scheduled task that will

154
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:30,570
then download system on and run it and

155
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:33,210
install it we then do windows event

156
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,580
forwarding and event collection and send

157
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,948
it to the Windows Event collector

158
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,599
so we're for windows event forwarding is

159
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:42,030
a built in feature into Windows that

160
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:44,639
effectively you give it a filter and you

161
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,469
tell it you over GPO you give it a bunch

162
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,060
of client machines and you say send

163
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,610
these subsets of your logs and your

164
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,490
local event via folder to this remote

165
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,840
window server and it's nice because

166
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,199
you're not installing extra software

167
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,820
there and it's all authenticated over

168
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,830
Kerberos authentication C and there's

169
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,630
like encryption on the network so we we

170
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,760
don't have to worry about that it has

171
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,199
things like there's a setting to say do

172
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,430
you want it to send the logs quickly or

173
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,440
do you want to send it with more

174
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,849
bandwidth efficient sand-like chunks so

175
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,190
is it like minimize latency minimize

176
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:16,050
bandwidth so it's all built in Windows

177
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,659
it's great and then you start to see the

178
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,590
logs building up an event collector at

179
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:22,530
which point we kind of want to do

180
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:24,119
something around analysis so we we do

181
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,859
when we is the win log beat on that

182
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,460
server and we put it onto an elk stack

183
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,620
which is running on a in docker on the

184
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,020
linux box that we help you install so

185
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,930
there's a script that runs on that Linux

186
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:39,060
box so that's a really high overview

187
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,760
we're now now I'm gonna hand over Adam

188
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,500
for a couple of minutes so I didn't

189
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,060
kind enough to make a test environment a

190
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,400
whole bunch of videos of the

191
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,780
installation process so I wasn't sure

192
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,880
this is gonna pan out because it's kind

193
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,250
of like basically Windows admin but once

194
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,600
you make it full-time to speed and you

195
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,800
may not notice the mistakes that have

196
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,560
been made along the way copying the

197
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,760
wrong files it's really interesting so

198
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,350
right when I didn't talked over it

199
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,590
Thank You Shane for throwing me under

200
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:06,140
the bus there yeah so before we start we

201
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,299
have to remember LME is very much a case

202
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,729
of using Windows components that already

203
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,260
exist within your estate and using the

204
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,180
functionality that already is this for

205
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,280
you you just gluing it together so I

206
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,340
show of hands how many people have

207
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,609
looked to the enemy documentation keep

208
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,349
them up if you're actually installed it

209
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:27,770
okay well hopefully we're pitching to

210
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:32,000
the right audience then so this is a

211
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:34,609
very abridged version of chapter 1 so

212
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,950
essentially what we're doing now is

213
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:40,760
importing the alameen gpo's and create

214
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:42,979
the organizational units and yeah it's

215
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,530
going at four times the speed but this

216
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,060
particular video for chapter one to

217
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,039
end-to-end took me about five minutes so

218
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,840
you can do this in a very short amount

219
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,490
of time like I said you're just

220
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,190
leveraging what's already built within

221
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,650
your windows of state and at this point

222
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:01,040
we're just importing the GPS for the

223
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:03,830
server and the clients and then later on

224
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,320
we'll configure the DPS actually push

225
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,120
down to basically say hey go push these

226
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,420
logs to this server you're not doing

227
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,680
anything really heavy weight in terms of

228
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,870
maintenance it was just doing stuff

229
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,160
tailoring it to your environment all the

230
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,730
heavyweight stuff is already done for

231
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,880
you and if we skip this over a bit

232
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,110
and skip over some it mistakes yeah this

233
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:30,890
is the point where you're saying hey

234
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:33,020
good point to this server some reason

235
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:36,919
it's like we started and the last part

236
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,539
here on the wek server so you can't see

237
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,250
it but this is wet doc testing that LM a

238
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:42,650
this is a testing infrastructure within

239
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,420
AWS what we would like to do in the

240
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,800
future is maybe present this

241
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,390
infrastructure as a cloud formation

242
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,530
template or a terraform so you could

243
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,540
actually have a play themselves and add

244
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:53,500
a look and actually help see how you do

245
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,500
it is the properly

246
00:08:53,510 --> 00:09:01,079
yep so wet util runs yes with the compet

247
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,130
we do the verification that's chapter

248
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:04,709
one works yes

249
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,120
event viewer and there is a subscription

250
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,138
on the left-hand side and you can see

251
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,730
that there's an active el-amin

252
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:10,910
subscription that's all that the top two

253
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:15,269
wonders for you

254
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:17,310
chapter 2 is slightly different at this

255
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:21,329
point we're trying to change the clients

256
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:23,369
and provide the files actual system

257
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:24,779
files with sis file that's essentially

258
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,130
what we're doing so you probably already

259
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:28,470
do this as part of your maintenance of

260
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:31,230
your estate anyway you're just providing

261
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,519
sig check which make sure that you're

262
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,399
running the latest and greatest version

263
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:46,680
assist one system on itself an update

264
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:48,180
script and a config for sis mom I miss

265
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,620
point with updating your scheduled tasks

266
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,500
so when the client comes online does a

267
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,360
GP update it pulls the latest version of

268
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,680
the system on update for conflicts so if

269
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,410
you do have to make the respective

270
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,540
changes as the LME project grows and

271
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,010
develops further this script to automate

272
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,920
I do this so you don't actually have to

273
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:07,500
go visit eating the individual servers

274
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:11,130
and manually do it yourself again you're

275
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,050
set having to say use the programs in

276
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:16,050
this location so again you have to

277
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,490
tailor it to your environment but as I

278
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,040
said earlier it's very minimal to the

279
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,540
top in terms of tailoring and then

280
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,719
finally you apply the GPO to your

281
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,310
organizational units for your clients so

282
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,839
if you really want to you don't have to

283
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:30,689
go Big Bang you can actually just say I

284
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,180
want to test on these ten perceive

285
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,040
high-value client could be your VP suite

286
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,290
you could be your C suite you execs or

287
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,339
you could just go for your tofu 250

288
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:44,130
clients if you perceive it to be really

289
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,470
important you can say I share what the

290
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,240
subset of the clients not this this is

291
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:55,459
what you use and you know you filtering

292
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:59,040
for and finally this works there we go

293
00:10:55,459 --> 00:11:00,510
the third step this isn't there's two

294
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,640
derivations of the third step there's

295
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,319
one this easy one where you just run a

296
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,520
scripting into self sign search for you

297
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,560
or

298
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,260
second one which you provide the search

299
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,839
for it so it's completely up to you but

300
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:17,250
essentially you onto your Linux box run

301
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:19,620
a script after doing a git clone you

302
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,240
basically say deploy install it does

303
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,670
everything for you it's literally a case

304
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,900
of put deep hit and say go make yourself

305
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,510
a coffee cuz it'll be done in five

306
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,400
minutes time lighting that there will be

307
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,650
a little little mini pause where it says

308
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,560
I'm going to let elasticsearch boot up

309
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:38,189
do its thing they're not configure it

310
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:42,359
nice hearings delay and right at the end

311
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:44,400
of this process a username and password

312
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,190
gets passed out you can see they're

313
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,100
being highlighted and that's you can

314
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:52,200
only see that once that's done and on

315
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,650
since we're saving that so then when you

316
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,190
are done

317
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:57,990
it also spits out for this version a zip

318
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:01,470
file with your suits the even good parts

319
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:03,810
the wack server which then does

320
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,760
end-to-end processing of encryption for

321
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:08,219
your logs so you don't have to worry

322
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,470
about that and then verify the doctor is

323
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:14,520
fully working by going to a web browser

324
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:17,970
going to your Linux server IP address or

325
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,680
DNF putting the admin in the passwords

326
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,630
giving you and then you see coupons

327
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,729
working so doc is doing all that in the

328
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:27,750
hot behind you behind the scenes and

329
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:31,470
it's um in terms of lob retention it's

330
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:34,950
all very much calculated based on the

331
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,510
available space on that server and

332
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:39,570
basically what the script will do will

333
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:41,970
go this Lord docker it's all-out stall

334
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,070
nginx which uses reverse proxy to do the

335
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,080
authentication

336
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:48,510
there's auto security updates works out

337
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,180
disk size and configured curator which

338
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,189
is retention of the logs generates a

339
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,630
self-signed cert s--

340
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,250
also generate the compiled password and

341
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:59,730
creates a zip file for Windows Server so

342
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,230
that's exactly what the third video did

343
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,020
I haven't done a fourth video because

344
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:06,570
that's all that's chapter four is

345
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:12,120
basically go to management import JSON

346
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:12,690
blob that's all it is right behind you

347
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,320
back to shape

348
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:17,670
thank you so hopefully those videos if

349
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,010
you guys are showing the kind of level

350
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,689
of

351
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:23,270
support I guess we're given to the user

352
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,770
so it's you know it's install these GPOs

353
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,090
and they're here on the links and like

354
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,460
install this software we get direct

355
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:30,260
links to the binaries where we can you

356
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,400
know and the scripts as well we get it

357
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,020
to the point where it's we're trying to

358
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,390
make it like a commodity item so that

359
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,860
you just have the LME installed and just

360
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,630
sits there ticking over you know check

361
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,110
gathering logs deleting logs also

362
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:43,670
updating and so on so this is a nice

363
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,940
nice little video because it's a real

364
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:49,490
real life example of one of the NTSC

365
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:51,140
reports on a PC 10 so the bottom here

366
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,580
there's two commands that it says if you

367
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,980
see this if you see this on your network

368
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,930
so some command being run it could be an

369
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,160
indicator of an attack of an attack of

370
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:06,709
Fundy some kind of lateral movement or

371
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:08,300
something so this machine is it's got

372
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,970
this one installed lock so going back to

373
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,469
the main database server and we are

374
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,230
typing in the cert util command which

375
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:17,840
was listed in that previous report and

376
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:21,230
proven it works it's decoding a file

377
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,610
into a PBS file and then you can go back

378
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:26,120
to the Cabana and you can look for cert

379
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:29,720
util and you will find let's see when it

380
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,100
expands it basically has captured that

381
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,010
process Croatian event when you hit

382
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,900
enter insert you till so if you were

383
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,610
here for the earlier talk with PPO the

384
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,709
sitting over there he did a lot of work

385
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,720
or on system on and talks about the

386
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:43,460
powers and this is this is awesome this

387
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,380
is like you know the process creation

388
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,990
event it's got so much information in it

389
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,580
that's useful for threat answers so

390
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,870
we've got the command that was run we've

391
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,290
got the username that was run from

392
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:56,000
you've got the sha-1 hash of the binary

393
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,709
you've got whether it's running the

394
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,150
integrity level their media means it's

395
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,350
run as a user if it's high then it's

396
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:03,380
been right clicked and run as

397
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:05,330
administrator so you've got a whole

398
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,160
bunch of information and I'm probably

399
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,690
going to little bit later but it just

400
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,100
shows that in 2n between like you know

401
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,240
some report comes out and saying find

402
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,010
this in your network and then you can

403
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,110
use system on and LME to gather it and

404
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:20,090
centrally centrally query that on your

405
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:21,890
network so a little bit of a summary so

406
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,700
it should take about what they to store

407
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,949
without distractions

408
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,750
I think Adam mentioned we did in 2 hours

409
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,360
- firewall changes because the person

410
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,680
went to lunch one of our customers but

411
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,630
once they came back it was just so

412
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,599
flowing in and you can see the the disks

413
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:38,180
filling up it's designed for 250 clients

414
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,440
this is important because the bottom got

415
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,939
a point if I jump to it's not a

416
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,100
replacement for a professional tool like

417
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:47,029
if you've got money for an easier tool

418
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,440
of which there are many you know keep

419
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,579
spending that money on that talks I'm

420
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,959
sure it's it's you know it's gonna be

421
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:52,609
bender supported this is kind of a

422
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,849
better than nothing solution where

423
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,930
you're using it's kind of a DIY logging

424
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,640
solution right you're taking all the

425
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,140
free and open-source tools you can put

426
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,459
them into a into a sort of an end-to-end

427
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:05,899
solution and getting that kind of

428
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:08,300
central central pane of glass but and as

429
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:09,649
sort of 250 clients basically the issue

430
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,719
we've got there is that we've only got

431
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:13,940
one server where the database resides

432
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,170
which means that it's going to be quite

433
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,839
easy to overload it if you've got like

434
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:19,399
10,000 clients on that it is technically

435
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,839
possible to do some load balancing and

436
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:22,630
have multiple servers doing that but we

437
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,890
have not put the development effort in

438
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:26,269
into that so we keep it to one single

439
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,500
server it's a lot easier for patching

440
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:28,850
and maintenance and bearing in mind this

441
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,589
is supposed to be kind of hassle free

442
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,899
commodity thing that just runs in your

443
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:35,570
network we have got had one client that

444
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:37,850
decided to roll it out over 5,000

445
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:40,120
machines and then and in the feedback

446
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,740
about LME will say runs a bit slow but

447
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,050
that 16 gig ram server with quad-core

448
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,120
hard quad core cpu was like it was

449
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:49,939
getting a battering basically there's

450
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,140
appointment they said it did work they

451
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:55,399
were wondering why it wasn't responding

452
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:56,959
to any commands at one point but yeah so

453
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:58,399
the retention period is basically up to

454
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,979
you is as big as your hard disk so that

455
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,480
scripts goes 80% of the hard disk so it

456
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,530
gives a bit of a 20% buffer and then it

457
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,849
just also rotates around and in terms of

458
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,799
that kind of sell to the customer and a

459
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:11,270
sell to NCC so there's a bit of a you

460
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:13,520
know why would a customer want to do

461
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:15,709
this so we initially went to customers

462
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,809
has said this is really good as an as a

463
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:19,459
kind of insurance policy so if you have

464
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:21,379
an incident this is going to reduce your

465
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:23,540
time to respond and work out what

466
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,860
happened what the impact was you know

467
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,720
with all the stuff you might get asked

468
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:28,280
during an incident it also reduces

469
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,990
forensics costs because you don't have

470
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,340
to start doing like may not have to do

471
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,809
forensics on discs because you've got

472
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,209
all the process creation logs in a

473
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:36,918
central location but that that cell

474
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,270
didn't really go down massively well of

475
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:39,950
a bunch of customers that in fact we had

476
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,540
one customer who said are used to

477
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,530
collect a load of logs but then I didn't

478
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,070
look so I just switched the whole thing

479
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,580
off

480
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:48,379
which was unfortunate because like when

481
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,429
we go to customer sites we like to have

482
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,910
logs there if there's been an incident

483
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:54,170
so we've kind of pivoted it's all a bit

484
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,720
recently to be more of an operational

485
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:58,940
health tool so we kind of describe it as

486
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,080
something for the end of the helpdesk so

487
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,360
some of the - tools that are coming

488
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,189
coming out now allow you to do things

489
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,689
like search for a username and it will

490
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,370
tell you which machines that users

491
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,750
logged into and then you can search for

492
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,429
a computer and then see all the blue

493
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,260
screen events all the application

494
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,060
crashes there's a dashboard that you

495
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,379
query KB numbers on so you can see

496
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,990
software updates and whether they've

497
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:21,440
been successful failed so my theory is

498
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:24,440
that bank lose a B as well Windows

499
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,240
Defender a B yeah so the theory is that

500
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,980
if the database falls over if you've got

501
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,390
like the help desk and they get called

502
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,690
in saying my Wi-Fi is not working and

503
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:34,220
they used this dashboard to work out why

504
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,510
they'll get that database working again

505
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,490
whereas if it's that kind of black box

506
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,570
it just rotates around if there's a if

507
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,520
there's a software a hardware problem

508
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,409
you might find you have an incident and

509
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,000
the things not working so I kind of want

510
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,960
to get people stuck into it and using it

511
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,420
so we're trying to give them some really

512
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,180
immediate like outcomes on the logs that

513
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:51,650
they're gathering in terms of NCRC why

514
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,180
are we interested so you know for

515
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,680
instant response purposes as I kind of

516
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,360
just mentioned the amount of times we go

517
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,040
to customer sites and they have no logs

518
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,360
and if they're not a government

519
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,889
department you know it's kind of not

520
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,240
really feasible to say could you install

521
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,610
some government software on your network

522
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,110
to gather Logs with this we can say like

523
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,149
this is all free and open source like

524
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,699
the guide is just you're the admin

525
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:12,170
you're installing yourself so we're

526
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,280
going to probably start trying that to

527
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,720
some customers if they haven't gotten

528
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,310
the money for commercial tools and

529
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,690
there's something about as I sort of

530
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,310
said write a start about raising the

531
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:22,490
water smart across the UK to try and get

532
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:24,290
people encouraged to do this next couple

533
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,670
of slides I'll talk a bit about some of

534
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,659
the design considerations we had because

535
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,310
I think it's not immediately apparent

536
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,660
like the architecture is quite simple

537
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:32,450
but actually to make it really really

538
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,800
simple for people wasn't wasn't wasn't

539
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,730
actually as easy as it sounds because he

540
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,330
kind of wanted to be like low

541
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:41,060
maintenance so first of all we took a

542
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,290
bunch of cues from the community so some

543
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,000
of these were mentioned earlier in

544
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:46,670
previous talks like Steph Thornton

545
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,870
Pete's thought but wet falls by Jessica

546
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,280
Payne was probably the one of the first

547
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,020
articles that came across so this is

548
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,090
Jessica's works at Microsoft

549
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,530
she wrote a blog about doing windows

550
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:58,070
have been forwarding and using power bi

551
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:59,450
to query the looks great so let's try

552
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,610
and automate that was basically kind of

553
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,410
the premise of this initially there's

554
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:06,290
also helped by a guy called cyber wall

555
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:08,990
dog who basically it looks a lot like

556
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:10,760
LME but it has a lot more tools on it's

557
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,230
got kind of like pipelines in an ml Nai

558
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,210
and all the rest of it so it's not

559
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,710
really if you know what you're doing

560
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,000
it's a really good tool but for that

561
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,290
kind of small business you just want it

562
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,450
to run in the corner it's probably not

563
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:23,270
for them but yet you know we've got a

564
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,830
lot of feedback and we reached out Swift

565
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:29,210
on security so swiftlet Security's

566
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:30,230
published a system config file and when

567
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,040
we launched this which was the day

568
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,940
before yeah the day before cyber UK so I

569
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,260
thought would be a really good idea to

570
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,940
reach out to some of the people we've

571
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,910
been in contact with just to say thank

572
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:43,070
you so I kind of working from home that

573
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:44,990
day and I sent an email to our social

574
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,879
media lead and just like the social

575
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,680
media leads everybody on Twitter right

576
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,410
so turnout they've never breached that

577
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,970
fiscal security before so I said could

578
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,620
you just send them a DM and say we're

579
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:56,060
launching this product tomorrow we're

580
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,139
using your config file thank you very

581
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,649
much you might just get some press

582
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,810
interest so hit Send 20 minutes later I

583
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:04,700
get a reply back saying we couldn't we

584
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:06,379
couldn't the M we just basically had to

585
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,800
send a public tweet and now anybody can

586
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,890
see it

587
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,740
and by the way people are responding so

588
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:14,750
sort of I obviously swore quite loudly

589
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,310
in my bedroom but you can see the

590
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:19,310
timestamp there 20 past 11:00 in the

591
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:22,399
morning so basically all the tweets look

592
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:23,780
like this it's when you realize you

593
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,920
actually work for an intelligence agency

594
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,270
and you've reached out to Security

595
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,590
Research and anonymous security

596
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,379
researcher on Twitter I'm like what the

597
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:31,909
hell have I done but yeah there's a lot

598
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:35,120
of like cynicism about why we're

599
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:35,960
reaching out so - so first tweet is at

600
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,709
20 past 11:00

601
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,940
there's a very long wait until 20 + 2

602
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,410
but luckily they took it you know if

603
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,670
they put is really good and that

604
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,050
actually they preferred the way we

605
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,510
reached out because they get a lot of

606
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:49,669
crazies kind of reaching out to them so

607
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,990
that's yeah but if anybody saw the

608
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:54,980
original tweet that was what was behind

609
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,940
it so so what did we choose sis Mon I

610
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,170
mean there's been so much praise and

611
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,520
Sissel and I really don't need to

612
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,380
probably sing his praises more but I

613
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,840
like this diagram so it's going up there

614
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,550
the one on the left is windward spawning

615
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,139
malware like C right it's a pirate

616
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,629
parent-child process

617
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,039
feel free to Nick your fire besides

618
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:11,149
you've got like is this hash equal to

619
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,779
this hash you know you get some kind of

620
00:22:11,149 --> 00:22:12,979
random

621
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:14,539
you know threat report saying look out

622
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,669
for these hashes on your network we can

623
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:19,039
see that in sis mom you've got things

624
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:20,539
like what's an admin up to what's the

625
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,429
particular user up to I think that one's

626
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:24,110
supposed to represent and then this one

627
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:26,000
up here top right pretty powerful but

628
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,350
process trees so you can work out what

629
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,370
normally starts the next thing the next

630
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,990
thing and if you start getting things

631
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:33,320
out sequence in that that could be weird

632
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:34,700
in like boot up sequences so so sis Mon

633
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,740
it's really really powerful but we only

634
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,330
really expose a very small proportion to

635
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,460
the users that use the dashboard because

636
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,110
we don't confuse them and as I said

637
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,909
earlier you know kind of focus on the

638
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,799
helpdesk tools which are more like

639
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:47,480
binary yes/no as opposed to like have a

640
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:49,070
GaN attack have a not you know you you

641
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,970
could accidentally set people peoples

642
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:54,649
hair on fire and waste time the other

643
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,870
lots of discussions we had around the

644
00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:59,178
hosting and infrastructure so the idea

645
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:01,719
initially was for LME was like you

646
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:03,950
basically have a single script you run

647
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,299
in fact if anybody are supposed to do

648
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,620
this they should I think it's quite good

649
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:08,990
idea a single script where you put your

650
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,418
address keys and it goes out crates your

651
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:13,519
elasticsearch service it hops out your

652
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:14,750
GPO it can apply it because PowerShell

653
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,340
you know run it with some elevated

654
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,830
privileges somewhere you could do the

655
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,090
whole thing in a single script and we

656
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,949
actually developed there we had a script

657
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,928
which was like I think about 500 lines

658
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,730
of PowerShell and it went from nothing

659
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:28,210
to you know working backwards going

660
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:31,159
crate infrastructure and AWS you know

661
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,480
crate the GPIOs apply them push this you

662
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,649
know make the folder persist more and

663
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,610
bang-bang-bang you could do it if you're

664
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:37,908
in the right place of your Windows

665
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:39,049
network that was great but the thing is

666
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:40,340
we're government's we can't go to

667
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:41,690
customers and say you know to do this

668
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,279
free tool you have to also pay for an

669
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:45,500
AWS account so then it was kind of like

670
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,880
well maybe we will do as sure as well

671
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,769
but then that's like double the effort

672
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,360
and then it's like all the other so in

673
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:51,740
the end it's like we're not we just

674
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,158
can't we can't go down that route

675
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,779
unfortunately so we decided to do make

676
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:57,980
it really portable with docker and then

677
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:00,049
you can work out whether you want it on

678
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,809
the Amazons Kuban eighties or but

679
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:04,760
although as your or whatever turns out

680
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:07,399
though that for some of the cloud

681
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,019
providers you can't just run like Cube

682
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:10,459
on a single server which is what we

683
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:14,149
wanted for the kind of small charity

684
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,860
small businesses so we said we can't we

685
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:17,310
can't we can't follow that route kind of

686
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,979
using cuban a season

687
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:21,810
still given its a cloud provider so we

688
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,510
took the decision to say to the customer

689
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:26,190
just install a vanilla a bunting box and

690
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:28,530
do what Adam showed you which was like

691
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:29,760
three commands and run that script which

692
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,830
would then like kind of configure the

693
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,420
Box up so we've ended up it kind of

694
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,740
reminds me if anybody watches Silicon

695
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,780
Valley you know where they make that

696
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,060
like server box like you know it's kind

697
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,680
of not very modern to make an appliance

698
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,000
that sits in Iraq but that's effective

699
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,610
what we've unfortunately made but it

700
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,010
works right so it's actually kind of

701
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:49,260
cost-effective as well so on on what

702
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:53,129
some of the big providers it's about 150

703
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:54,870
pound a month to rent a quad core 16 gig

704
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:58,350
ram server with like say half a terabyte

705
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:59,639
SSD that's quite a little bit cost as it

706
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,020
keeps adding up but you probably gets

707
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,090
over for like 1500 pounds or something

708
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,590
you stick under a desk somewhere this

709
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,240
doesn't need to be like massively

710
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,409
massively resilient because the

711
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,760
organization's were pitching it to

712
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:13,440
haven't got anything today anyway so

713
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:15,420
it's like kind of nice to have the next

714
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,740
slide so updating LME so this is this is

715
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:19,410
really hard because we wanted to be

716
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,850
super easy so we can update we can put

717
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,440
make this in this in place to update the

718
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,240
software so the automatic security

719
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,760
updates happens on Linux pretty pretty

720
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,320
easily we have this batch file that when

721
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,910
it runs is the scheduled task is

722
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,620
checking if system on has changed on the

723
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:33,300
server and if the config files changing

724
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,770
the service it looks at the file version

725
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,600
on system on and it there's a hash check

726
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:39,139
of the config file either of them

727
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,580
changes it redeploys which is quite nice

728
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:43,020
but what I really want is and this is

729
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,370
maybe so the audience have a think about

730
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,320
like considering this across multiple

731
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:48,659
machines I want the ability to sort of

732
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,270
type in one machine update LME and it

733
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:52,680
says you are out a day of you know your

734
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,600
six-month versions out there your call

735
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,160
figures from three months ago your

736
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,840
window beats not sending right back the

737
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,520
right stuff and that's that's really

738
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,290
hard so at the moment I think we haven't

739
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,450
quite got there and we've got some ideas

740
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:05,670
that we can maybe tag events to sort of

741
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:07,650
identify what a version of LME was at

742
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:10,740
the time but because we're you know

743
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:12,810
we're across three kind of server you

744
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,460
know client-server Linux BOTS and two

745
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:17,250
kind of different technology stacks plus

746
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,840
L stack it's really hard to kind of do

747
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,130
that like easy like what do I have to

748
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,419
update what's changed since the last

749
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:23,789
time I deployed LME

750
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:27,559
but we'll get there

751
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:31,260
I will now hand over to Adam sonic dates

752
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:35,760
so we started rolling out ellamy to

753
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:37,440
willing participants / I know people who

754
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,299
expressed an interest in this kind of

755
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,279
involvement but didn't have any money to

756
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:43,620
actually do anything so they were like I

757
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,260
said waiting participants back in

758
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,789
January this year and as part of that we

759
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,049
asked them to provide some interesting

760
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:52,440
anecdotes about what they learned from

761
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:54,840
Al Amin and either some of the images

762
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,860
that represent what we found so far left

763
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:00,360
usb-cable

764
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:01,860
one of our clients had USB assertion

765
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,629
that that's being logged with through

766
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:07,620
use this one so that was coming to Ella

767
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:10,620
me and they found one machine somewhere

768
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:14,969
is constantly having us people look

769
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:16,439
plugged in plugged up put in go on to

770
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:19,289
the point was a couple of thousands in

771
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,960
the cooked in an hour or so yeah so it

772
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:24,658
was there's a massive amount of event so

773
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,639
we they went to go trace it turns out

774
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:27,779
the actual machine had a faulty USB port

775
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:30,418
on the front where somebody was plugging

776
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:33,029
in their phone to charge it and I think

777
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:34,830
that either the weight of the phone or I

778
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:37,740
don't really know exactly but basically

779
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:39,769
the the solar traces on the piece PCB

780
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,090
were failing so it's just a micro

781
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:43,679
fracture and it was just enough to for

782
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,289
it to go registered unregistered

783
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,909
registered on register which is quite an

784
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:50,370
interesting event if you have somebody

785
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:53,990
trying to I know if your policy says

786
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:57,350
don't use USB and then we can capture it

787
00:27:53,990 --> 00:28:00,240
middle one is a break glass account so

788
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,850
this was a domain admin account that was

789
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,620
only supposed to be used in emergencies

790
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:06,539
and it was found to be used to be

791
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,268
installing a wireless drive for a

792
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:11,549
keyboard I believe should not have been

793
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:13,500
happening so again we're starting to see

794
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:16,820
some really interesting events with

795
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:20,639
anatomy and the finally the last one

796
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:23,639
through week by week analysis of normal

797
00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:26,789
trend activities identified somebody

798
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:28,110
using a program delete all a four

799
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:32,940
o'clock in the morning deleting about

800
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:35,149
1,500 files we thought last week with so

801
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,979
raised to a.m. stretch team

802
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:39,109
who spoke to them it turns out actually

803
00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:41,989
that person was in the States so the

804
00:28:39,109 --> 00:28:43,489
time isn't isn't that unusual and they

805
00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:44,950
were about to return the laptop that's

806
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:47,119
why our instructor team so again

807
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:48,619
sanitizing the device again isn't

808
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:51,289
unusual it's just more of the case that

809
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:52,549
we are finding these things it's worth

810
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:55,509
pointing out that we're not actually

811
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:57,710
looking for malware at this point so

812
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:59,359
that's reason why I would not say hey we

813
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:02,599
found Mario we're just not looking for

814
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:04,099
malware at the point at this point so go

815
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:05,029
on to frequently asked questions are

816
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:08,989
there any questions right now

817
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:12,139
I thought there okay where can you get

818
00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:13,820
the videos from where eventually you

819
00:29:12,139 --> 00:29:16,189
hope to have them the non speeded up

820
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,570
versions on youtube I was kind of hoping

821
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,830
that maybe one of the questions might

822
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:20,059
have been a frequently asked question in

823
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:23,418
which I could just jump to you straight

824
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:24,739
away but if not I'll just crack on there

825
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:27,619
will be Q&A afterwards as well if

826
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:29,599
there's enough time but so first

827
00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:30,978
question what what about other network

828
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:32,869
devices and other critical services

829
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:35,330
appreciate the windows it operates on

830
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:37,399
honor on a network fabric that can also

831
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:39,619
provide enriched logs to you for you to

832
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:42,738
do some malware analysis or at least

833
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:44,899
threat hunting we could either choose to

834
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:46,789
loads of different things poorly or do

835
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:49,129
one thing really well at this time so

836
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:52,609
it's not a case of no it's just a lot

837
00:29:49,129 --> 00:29:56,779
yet if you have a particular need for a

838
00:29:52,609 --> 00:29:57,949
particular vendor let us know we can

839
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:03,649
then prioritize that as part of the next

840
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:06,469
part of the drop of enemy similarly we

841
00:30:03,649 --> 00:30:10,580
get this ass all the time because people

842
00:30:06,469 --> 00:30:12,679
like shiny things like me people say

843
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:17,559
we're not just a Windows house we're not

844
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:20,239
just a one vendor again it's just not

845
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:23,570
right now thing but if you really want

846
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:25,460
to say Mac OS is my big thing I really

847
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:28,639
want alle me for that please let us know

848
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:30,979
all Linux as well they're in it's just

849
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:34,008
not yet and there's some massive

850
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:35,899
development work required an NCC group

851
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:38,419
who put an awful lot of development work

852
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:41,570
we're trying to get them focused on the

853
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:44,460
windows products as part of the roadmap

854
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:46,020
and really another question a popular

855
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,200
question and cross and get what github

856
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:51,150
as well is why don't use technology X in

857
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,060
the middle one the top is open distro if

858
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:57,560
everybody heard it open distro no okay

859
00:30:54,060 --> 00:31:00,870
so open distro is taking elasticsearch

860
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,879
free and then plugging in a whole bunch

861
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:06,239
of security things that was missing and

862
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,940
this came from AWS so it did some really

863
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,230
cool things as well like alerting the

864
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,030
reason why we haven't used it is because

865
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:15,720
we already developed a le'me before it

866
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:18,030
got over so socially so I think maybe

867
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,640
two or three weeks before we went open

868
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:23,670
source on github open distro was

869
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,140
announced so if they open sourced it six

870
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:29,040
months ago alameen maybe a different

871
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:30,420
products but again it's all open source

872
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,550
so if you really want to use profiler

873
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:36,780
sort of the Cabana go knock yourself out

874
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:39,360
just let me make sure I'm collecting the

875
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:41,940
right events no I don't think any per

876
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,889
vendor can assert that unless they do a

877
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,350
full packet capture and ultimately

878
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:49,010
you'll be paying for that it's it's

879
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:52,620
expensive to store that information and

880
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:54,450
we're all like we're all security

881
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:57,179
professionals here is it game wacom

882
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,410
alright so just because we know what the

883
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,550
threats are today doesn't necessarily

884
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:03,410
mean know what the threats are tomorrow

885
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:07,620
so Alami using peer reviewed and

886
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:12,560
well-respected methods like swift on

887
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:14,760
security system config and methyls etc

888
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:18,120
we hope we're doing the right thing but

889
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:20,790
ultimately we can't say for sure one

890
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:23,219
more does the NCE NCRC get a feed on my

891
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:24,720
data no we're not going to be doing a

892
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,340
stock as a service for you it's

893
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,580
completely your data completely for your

894
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:31,980
infrastructure you may choose to put the

895
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:35,340
data into an AWS elastic search as a

896
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:37,140
service well that's your shell in and at

897
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,510
that point it's your decision for it to

898
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,590
leave your Shores is stage complete

899
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:44,460
within your shoulders it doesn't need

900
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:46,110
internet connectivity to work either can

901
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,310
I use let me through threat hunting I

902
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,929
thought I put a picture of Red Dead

903
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:52,530
Redemption in there because we're all

904
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:53,670
geeks here you can't it's just at the

905
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,720
moment we're focusing on trying to

906
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:58,230
providing

907
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,630
paying a glass tick so you provide a

908
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:05,130
customer experience try and drive the

909
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:07,740
adoption lobby fair say so what is the

910
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:09,809
future el-amin we have an active

911
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,580
development within github so this

912
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:13,620
screenshot was from I think last week

913
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:16,710
it's already out date we've already

914
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:19,469
accepted a merge so it was in the case

915
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:21,330
of weary since the WOD unless it's I

916
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:23,809
it's a case of we're doing accident we

917
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:25,860
have a roadmap for the next two years

918
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:29,370
another really cool thing is mark

919
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:30,658
russinovich published last week this

920
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:33,928
month version turns out would increase

921
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:35,520
DNS Hey and we're already looking at

922
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:39,179
dashboards to include this later

923
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:43,350
so top left we've got DNS query that's

924
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:45,780
top 50 the NF and the bottom left is 25

925
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:47,178
apps calling DNS so in seek you start

926
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,889
seeing some really what high value

927
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:50,429
information being extracted out of this

928
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,740
information

929
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:54,299
she really cool and finally we would

930
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,640
like to introduce more of the mitre

931
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:58,799
attack framework we've heard lots this

932
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:03,450
last few days it's a really valuable

933
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:05,490
thing yeah and that's essentially it so

934
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:07,679
as I've already alluded to you have a

935
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:10,530
github we have a repo that anybody can

936
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:14,099
contribute to or provide any issues or

937
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:15,720
bug fixes etc take photo if you like

938
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:18,210
just make sure I've got orange lantern

939
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:22,709
yard don't get me in it and please get

940
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:24,599
involved ultimately adoption will make

941
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:25,889
the tool better for everybody even if

942
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,629
you create download it and only

943
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:30,389
contribute a dashboard people were

944
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:34,589
really value those dashboards that's

945
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:37,080
enough no I mean so on github we've got

946
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:38,250
like the issues tab and the will save

947
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,540
once all the ideas to have whatever

948
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,770
suggestions that people are actually

949
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,690
actively kind of saying could you try

950
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:45,060
this or obvious I've tried to install it

951
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:46,950
and this has gone wrong and I son

952
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,690
Convention as I don't mentioned earlier

953
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:51,569
we've got somebody at NCC group who

954
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:53,190
called uncle Duncan who's basically

955
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:54,659
we've got them contracted out and

956
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:58,880
they're checking get help every single

957
00:34:54,659 --> 00:35:01,140
day so they yeah they're on that so

958
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,180
that's that's in the my talk so

959
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,799
hopefully is giving you overview of LME

960
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,299
and kind of where it came from so it's a

961
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,190
little bit more but it not massively

962
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,230
technical but it

963
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:16,609
be a background about the developments

964
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:19,520
of it any questions you might think you

965
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:21,348
didn't want it yeah so el-amin looks

966
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,180
like it's designed for small little

967
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:25,760
businesses small areas that don't have

968
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,828
any security expertise never a limited

969
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,750
IT capability yeah which are going to

970
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:31,010
primarily be window shops you're going

971
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,839
to be sporting happily Windows desktops

972
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:34,579
you've chose to stick it on a Linux

973
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:36,349
server it's most likely gonna be stuck

974
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:38,750
under a desk forgotten about three years

975
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:40,280
you know you've got a cold piece of kit

976
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,480
you can all your logs on the link server

977
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,970
but that's probably not the expertise to

978
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,109
be looked at what have you done to to

979
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,629
ensure that doesn't become a security

980
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:49,190
problem in itself yes so the Linux box I

981
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:50,869
mean luckily because we run that scripts

982
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,910
on the Linux box when you when you

983
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:55,040
install it we do things like you know

984
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:58,069
auto-updates is the first thing we do

985
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,690
but we're kind of hoping that the box is

986
00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:00,980
secure it like stable enough that you

987
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:03,770
can sit there and just also rotate the

988
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:05,599
logs not run out of disk space but it

989
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:08,060
was a big concern like seriously was

990
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,470
because we we went to one customer and

991
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,299
we said have you used Linux before and

992
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:13,160
this is a security person small is like

993
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:16,849
120 personal organization and they were

994
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:18,140
like well we've I have a Linux box you

995
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:19,280
know do now to enable had to now to

996
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,540
update software and they're like oh

997
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,730
don't worry can Google Apps gates

998
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,560
because they have never done that before

999
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:26,359
so it's a bit of a worry but the I think

1000
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,040
the challenge is I'm not sure in our

1001
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:29,690
position what else like I haven't come

1002
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,290
up a suitable turnit of this window

1003
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:35,329
space we had one of our other customers

1004
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:36,980
their gain windows windows all windows

1005
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:38,450
so they try to install blocker for

1006
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,619
Windows and then try to put Elkin to

1007
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,560
that so it's kind of a bit of a fudgy

1008
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:45,109
way but then that runs on Linux anyway

1009
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:48,529
so yeah I mean if you've got any ideas

1010
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:49,819
on how else we can do it like database

1011
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:52,069
software that allows you to visualize

1012
00:36:49,819 --> 00:36:53,300
this free doesn't need a license so

1013
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:54,770
that's kind of like we ended up going to

1014
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,060
an elastic search because it seemed like

1015
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:58,130
the most obvious solution and then it

1016
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,839
was kind of like how do you let them use

1017
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,010
elastic search but without making them

1018
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,150
realize they're actually using Linux

1019
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,010
like under the hood you know it's kind

1020
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:05,119
of we've even got things like when

1021
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:07,160
you're installing it it shows you how to

1022
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,050
use putty and winscp and stuff because

1023
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,700
literally screen grabs because we know

1024
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:12,560
that people probably have never done

1025
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:15,919
that before the other thing to mention

1026
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:18,230
is the windows lock for Windows I think

1027
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,450
to let all the resources be available to

1028
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:23,780
the Linux box okay I'm

1029
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:25,879
the container so you may need the 16-gig

1030
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,930
on your host but that doesn't

1031
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,460
necessarily mean you'll pocket

1032
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:29,990
containing like she's gonna be able to

1033
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,810
make use of that so therefore the script

1034
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:35,479
may fail yes asacs which is quite java

1035
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:37,880
it's quite memory intensive we may need

1036
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,730
to relook into that when docket goes to

1037
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:44,180
the windows subsystem for linux or

1038
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:46,670
subsystem which i believe is going to be

1039
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:49,250
coming out soon so I completely take the

1040
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:50,870
point if somebody is window shop maybe

1041
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,920
six months time when that is a bit more

1042
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:54,259
further down the line you don't have to

1043
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,150
rely on hyper being all the resources

1044
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,400
are available then yeah I don't see why

1045
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,630
that can be a thing it's kind of also I

1046
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,920
mentioned them that slide that Weaver

1047
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:02,990
ended up with like a kind of appliance

1048
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,220
because it's almost like it's like when

1049
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,959
you get like a network gear it's

1050
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,359
actually running Linux but the user

1051
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,310
doesn't kind of know so I'm hoping that

1052
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,320
hoping you'll be stable our test

1053
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:14,000
participant base be fine it's been

1054
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,310
running we've got one on our network

1055
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,270
it's not being rebooted for like since

1056
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:25,820
February something so any other

1057
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:27,490
questions no okay well thank you very

1058
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:31,380
much thank you

1059
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:31,379
[Applause]
