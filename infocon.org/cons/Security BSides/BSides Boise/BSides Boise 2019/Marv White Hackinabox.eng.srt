1
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,560
so apparently it's a good thing if

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,000
you're gonna be presenting bringing your

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,729
laptop I didn't know that so hi I'm our

4
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,370
boy this is the packing a box this is my

5
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,110
silly little Raspberry Pi project my

6
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,520
lead security a firmer lead information

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,070
security engineer for IO solutions in

8
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,750
Farmington Utah

9
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,769
I am the one-man army of security for my

10
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:55,800
company letters behind my name I'm one

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,610
of the chief cat herders of vco1 and did

12
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,220
it on labs hackerspace in sonic city and

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,400
I have hobby ADHD I collect hobbies as a

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,100
hobby and find myself with the twenty

15
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,560
raspberry PI's and plan 60 floors and

16
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,750
stuff like this and I needed something

17
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,140
to do next Lisa this why did I do this

18
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,040
several years ago when I was studying

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,850
for the CD age it was my first exposure

20
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,539
into the pen testing world blue team guy

21
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:36,119
normally I don't hurt a lot on the

22
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,369
offensive side and I wanted to come up

23
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:44,399
with a lab to test this stuff out and

24
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,280
learn and practice and for various

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,930
reasons I ditched the things that

26
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,480
sense and then with these Raspberry Pi

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,980
things and as this project kind of went

28
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,100
on I found that it was potentially

29
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,830
pretty helpful for students and you can

30
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,910
set up a lab to safely teach pen testing

31
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,190
without putting vulnerable machines in

32
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,530
your environment and letting people find

33
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,459
them online and

34
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,600
and I have no idea that what was going

35
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,930
on when I started this one thing kind of

36
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,710
led to another and then people got more

37
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,330
interested people got more interested

38
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,610
than I did but I just pushed through and

39
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,470
built out my project and I talked about

40
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,030
it for some reason England I'm very much

41
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,110
your honor so originally I was going to

42
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:50,250
set up a VMware Xen hypervisor on some

43
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,870
old hardware I had laying around my

44
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,060
house and at the time the assumed that I

45
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,850
had laying around used to use ddr2 RAM

46
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,570
that was super expensive and I didn't

47
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,690
feel like paying $500 for a gram or

48
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,780
something like that what was that

49
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,900
so I started looking around for other

50
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,750
options and then I found out about

51
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,290
Metasploit Little Miss portables a VM

52
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:24,570
that is a victim service that you can

53
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,240
use to learn medicine and learn the hand

54
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,880
testing stuff and so that that's

55
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,260
originally what I wanted to do is run

56
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:34,670
that

57
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,240
being run maybe a calamy him to attack

58
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,030
from and have everything kind of all in

59
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:47,180
one and then I started by Hank as berry

60
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,730
pies or people started giving raspberry

61
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,910
PI's and there's collected a tongue so I

62
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,959
started thinking why don't we use these

63
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,610
they're cheap they're all over the place

64
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:04,190
I had a bunch and to do something with

65
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:08,000
it and then I wanted to keep everything

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,950
kind of again all in one spot one place

67
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:17,110
all right let's throw it in the box and

68
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,168
with the setup that I eventually came up

69
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:24,340
with everything was easy to power

70
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,479
self-contained and more importantly

71
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,130
isolated from any environments that you

72
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,940
bring into woods as the security guy

73
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,100
always talked people you know maybe you

74
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,840
don't want to plug that little toy in on

75
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,550
a corporate network I don't want you

76
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,669
getting owned and then everyone else

77
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:47,630
getting home as well that's step one a

78
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,789
hole in the box

79
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,979
I just bought a tool box and threw

80
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:54,350
everything in there and then found that

81
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:59,419
I couldn't power it as a part of it the

82
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:01,280
displays that I use the the first one

83
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,850
was just like a $80 TV from Walmart and

84
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,610
it just happened to fit exactly in the

85
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,010
lid of the Harbor free tool box of Ages

86
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,560
and so I could just snap it in and that

87
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,280
was kind of fun but then powering it was

88
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,320
giant Woolworth ugly grabbed a couple

89
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,690
raspberry PI's of cases velcro them

90
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,930
together the ultimate monitor that I

91
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:33,180
used was a games dinging display HDMI

92
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,380
USB powered monitor it didn't fit as

93
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,320
nicely so I just grabbed some industrial

94
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,850
stinger del Corona slap it in there USB

95
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,000
power supply was in there and they had

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,580
some tackle box tubs lying around threw

97
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,750
it in their side and places for SD cards

98
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,220
back in the days when I only had a

99
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,750
couple of the locks and lock picks I

100
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,150
throw my lockpick stuff in there too

101
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,790
that's changed since this is kind of

102
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,580
what it looked like beginning a giant

103
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,840
wall wart all of the power supplies for

104
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,900
the raspberry PI's everything table

105
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,840
together I was using a little switch as

106
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,630
well to network the raspberry PI's

107
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:24,300
together and this it was unwieldy

108
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,590
unmanageable and then that that just

109
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,140
gives me angst and anxiety to this day

110
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,250
and can't stand those things and this

111
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,289
was the original TV display that was in

112
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:42,620
there this that again just water 19

113
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:48,330
select 720p TV and just it worked pretty

114
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,240
good but the big thing was powering it

115
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,500
was kind of a pain and having the power

116
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,530
supply and tool box banging around I was

117
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,880
always afraid was gonna bust the TVs

118
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,770
and this is kind of how everything

119
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,290
evolved over time I got rid of the TV

120
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,919
and then found the game's monitor looks

121
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:16,870
like four times as expensive but it

122
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,730
worked really well for the days I was

123
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,770
using a little for poor Ethernet switch

124
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,570
so there has raised to talk to each

125
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,240
other again didn't like the wall word

126
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,360
power yet so I started doing some ad hoc

127
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,900
Wi-Fi stuff then all my friends with the

128
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,570
author tools decided to make that not

129
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,350
super great so then I stole a network

130
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,540
cable from the hacker space and because

131
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,490
never buying network cables they're

132
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:59,440
freed everywhere so just made a

133
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,260
crossover cable and network that way at

134
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,780
one point with all the little devices I

135
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,789
had I wanted to make multiple victims

136
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,750
servers because I had playing 64

137
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:19,030
Jaguar boards and the buncher advertises

138
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,600
all these things and then the Windows 10

139
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,330
IOT release the Raspberry Pi was really

140
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,370
interesting to me until I started

141
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,680
playing around with it I was hoping that

142
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,190
you could run like the servers or

143
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,169
something on it

144
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,169
and really it's more like a sensor that

145
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,370
you have to control from Windows to

146
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,849
seeing and so eventually that just got

147
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:46,260
taken out the kid as well but I wanted

148
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,149
as many different services as possible

149
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:51,600
to attack a train and mimic what a real

150
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,089
network looks like on a small scale with

151
00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:01,769
varying amounts of success so what it

152
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:07,550
looks like today planed everything just

153
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,959
fell occurred all the tools in there you

154
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:14,040
can see the hole that I cut out to power

155
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,449
right these little tool boxes that you

156
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:19,410
get from Harbor Freight are great

157
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,750
because you can kind of make them

158
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,070
they're modularity and they can do

159
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:27,990
whatever you want and the top of there

160
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,610
you can see a little Wi-Fi router that I

161
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,610
have that was in there that was one of

162
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,779
the things that I did

163
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:38,160
it's little GI something-or-other you

164
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,170
can have a lot of fun with those as an

165
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,350
aside the

166
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,590
you should make a little pineapples out

167
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,900
of them things like that I use that for

168
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,840
a while as well but I ran into a lot of

169
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,910
problems with that just the throughput

170
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,010
wasn't very good and they're not really

171
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,290
designed for things to talk across that

172
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,120
there weren't design you plug it into

173
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,190
your hotel or things like that just to

174
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,580
give yourself Wi-Fi without having to

175
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,410
pay other ratings and it wasn't super

176
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,640
reliable so it got taken out of the

177
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,890
final version as well but if you find

178
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,990
those little routers are they're fun had

179
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,710
projects and of themselves and that's

180
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,940
the game's display that's a sweet little

181
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,780
monitor it's like a 15 inch display and

182
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:36,130
it's 1080 and that was a great find

183
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,720
particularly because of the USB power

184
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,250
and there were some other options as

185
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,040
well games doesn't make this display

186
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,180
anymore and the replacement now that's a

187
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,120
super super expensive but aoc makes one

188
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,520
and I think I've seen a cert or

189
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,530
something like that have a few of these

190
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,640
that are little USB powered displays and

191
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,590
that the USB power is really key because

192
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,070
you can just plug everything into one

193
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:09,580
one like charging station as long as the

194
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,270
charging station has enough Amsterdam

195
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,860
everything and that that was one thing I

196
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,810
actually had to do

197
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,510
three or four different various various

198
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,920
charters just to find one that would

199
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,170
work because you can burn out the

200
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,960
charter really easily when everything

201
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,560
boots up plug three things in everything

202
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,720
dies Raspberry Pi 3 years what we have

203
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,670
today the three B or whatever it is it's

204
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,020
got like three or four times more

205
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,660
powerful than the Raspberry Pi 2 and

206
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,550
that rhetoric mighty was the first one

207
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,980
oh this would actually work on tally on

208
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,930
the Raspberry Pi B it was just

209
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,580
absolutely useless you couldn't do

210
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:00,810
anything with it but the the later ones

211
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,540
even it's not a full-fledged computer

212
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,660
obviously the you can do a lot and if

213
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,930
you know tally you can do everything

214
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,990
that you wanted as long as there's an

215
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,770
arm library for whatever drivers that

216
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,670
you need the victim server is just

217
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,830
raspbian with a basic lamp stack on it

218
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:28,740
and then deep dvwa is the damn

219
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,200
vulnerable web app is a great little web

220
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,339
app and test training module super easy

221
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,360
for the other and

222
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,850
was that was the best way to find

223
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,280
something marble that you can control

224
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,760
does he think set levels on it you know

225
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,950
everything's wide open clear text

226
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,980
passwords and things like that too it's

227
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,660
pretty locked down actually have to work

228
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,230
at it too anything to it the tool acts

229
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,430
as they say it is like a twenty five

230
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,790
dollar girl or the free thing the games

231
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,490
display it's a little travel monitor

232
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,610
these they sell a Xbox kit that goes

233
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,830
with it so you throw everything together

234
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,110
and take it on the road with you I

235
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,870
really like the the power for it being

236
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,370
USB removed

237
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,650
having the horror out a bunch of cables

238
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,210
and stuff like that and I really liked

239
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,270
that and then I used the anchor or USB

240
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,670
chargers and those were absolutely the

241
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:39,980
best they they had plenty of amperage to

242
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,520
run everything without drowning out and

243
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,320
they're dis rock solid advanture makes

244
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,710
it I'll buy it a lot of problems that we

245
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,160
ran into the the power I went through

246
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,010
three or four different fabrics before I

247
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:55,880
found the anchor

248
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,920
that would actually work you know

249
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,120
they're great for charging your phone or

250
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,990
something like that it's more more

251
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,110
forgiving than a computer computers

252
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,209
don't like to be shut down suddenly and

253
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:12,589
you end up really flashing your SD cards

254
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:17,779
online when when things go south with

255
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:20,990
Callie Callie does not like to be just

256
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,269
gracelessly shut down if you don't do it

257
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:25,370
an actual shutdown that perhaps really

258
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,790
bad never did we figure out why there

259
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,120
are a lot of packages that you're going

260
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,519
to expect in a Linux distribution that

261
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:37,670
are not on the raspbian or the the

262
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:41,720
Callie distro for our little things like

263
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,019
coral so you have to update those and

264
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,519
you kind of fall into dependency held

265
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,899
that I know that's any Linux system

266
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:53,149
really the xenon flash machine when I

267
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:54,980
was actually taking pictures for these

268
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,110
slides I break one of my tality

269
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,180
raspberry PI's because the flash on my

270
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,449
camera there's one little tip on there

271
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:08,990
that apparently a really great light did

272
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,759
flips it or something and it crashes it

273
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,829
there's there's a couple really cool

274
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,750
articles

275
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,800
the Raspberry Pi 3 was first introduced

276
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,060
recommend or going to read those are

277
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,269
kind of fascinating the TV remote

278
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:25,220
control and I was running the TV it

279
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,589
would bounced around in the tool box and

280
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:29,899
I cracked the screen eventually with

281
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:32,240
that that's why I'm going to the games

282
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,100
eventually and I'd kept home I don't

283
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,779
even have this TV anymore and I just

284
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:40,819
found the the remote after I moved a

285
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:46,699
couple years ago this lot server notes

286
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:48,350
all over the place that you don't even

287
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,259
have that hardware for anyone for the

288
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:52,160
perfect concept

289
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,449
I took somebody who's not a security guy

290
00:15:55,449 --> 00:16:01,699
we went through we built the raspbian

291
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:06,589
image with the evw a put everything

292
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:10,730
together this guy started going through

293
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,060
a DW a walkthrough lab and everything

294
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,649
just started working right out of the

295
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:16,190
box

296
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,009
with the exception of the packages that

297
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:22,399
I would expect him in Cali just weren't

298
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,389
there and so you need to make sure that

299
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:28,790
you install on your tooling before you

300
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,540
have it off to a student that was a fair

301
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,279
of my part I give this guy a system in

302
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:35,899
the lab I said here you go step by step

303
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:38,540
through this and oh hey this is missing

304
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,509
that's missing that's missing but it

305
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:44,509
worked pretty good pretty good and be

306
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:49,160
quickly so I think that the the perfect

307
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,259
concept

308
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,079
proved out that someone not ever

309
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,000
touching

310
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,240
this stuff was able to go and start

311
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,150
doing your home inoculation and things

312
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,110
like that

313
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,380
he never really encountered before so it

314
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,359
was a fun test of it wasting a

315
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:14,470
privileged system the victim services

316
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:18,220
I wanted more I wanted to throw stuff

317
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,780
that we see a lot of like web servers

318
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,359
databases what's in the real world I

319
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,180
wanted to build more of those and I'm

320
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:33,330
still looking at services they can be

321
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,830
hit an attack that aren't necessarily

322
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,100
intentionally weak but just what's

323
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,970
what's out there and I wanted to have

324
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,820
more of them you'd be get into a price

325
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,790
stale issue and we have ten raspberry

326
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,580
PI's all of a sudden the value aspect of

327
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:57,910
this goes out the door the Kelly power

328
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,220
damages if you if you don't shut down

329
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,070
before you power it off you were almost

330
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:09,250
certainly risk corrupting the SD card

331
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,780
and I think it's because the logs are

332
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,320
always writing so you may be some log

333
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,020
management where it's not not trying to

334
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,980
do I owe the entire time I haven't quite

335
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,140
figured that out but that's one of the

336
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,029
things that

337
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:25,200
this better and then there's a lot of

338
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,139
fun something you can do 3d print cases

339
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:32,340
or almost free play with Legos I really

340
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,049
wanted to make like a little Lego

341
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:36,179
supercomputer the Raspberry Pi as part

342
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,690
of this and the lab needs to be improved

343
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:44,700
we need to build more content in there

344
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:51,960
and get more not necessarily a lab on

345
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,389
Rails you know do this do that do that

346
00:18:54,389 --> 00:18:57,899
pop the box but make it a better

347
00:18:57,899 --> 00:18:59,969
learning process and that's something

348
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:02,369
that I'm I'm asking the community to

349
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:04,289
help out so feel free to reach out to me

350
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:07,649
if any of this resonating you feel like

351
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:09,659
help them out

352
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:12,269
then there's the pie top the pie pie top

353
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:16,049
is a little laptop that it runs off of

354
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:18,739
Raspberry Pi so they give you everything

355
00:19:18,739 --> 00:19:21,749
to build it it's like a two or three

356
00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:24,899
hour project and you can actually fit

357
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:26,369
tea raspberry pies in there so you could

358
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:30,320
have your victim server along with the

359
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:34,019
attack server on one piece of equipment

360
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:37,049
not even in the in the box it's kind of

361
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:38,839
expensive very two three or four bucks

362
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:43,289
and tally doesn't make the high top

363
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:46,019
release you might be able to get all the

364
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,399
drivers and everything for that but

365
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:51,029
probably better if you reverse engineer

366
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:53,940
tally into the PI top release and start

367
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,460
putting in

368
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,110
let's play for him working things like

369
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,240
that onto the pipe or at least he

370
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,130
stepped out of SD cards of the nospace

371
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,630
weights to make this whole thing cheaper

372
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:14,280
that original display was under $100 I

373
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,670
want to say it was like 80 or $90

374
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,960
looking at that and then the Gaines

375
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:26,370
display at the time was about 170 did or

376
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,980
you don't even need to use the Box

377
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,240
concept you can just get a couple

378
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,790
raspberry PI's hook one up to the TV the

379
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,700
other one runs headless you can also run

380
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,180
these services locally you can install

381
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,710
dvwa and you just attack yourself but

382
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,570
because I'm a network guy I always want

383
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,280
to see the traffic on the wire I want to

384
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,630
be able to run pack the captures things

385
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,510
like that so I liked having to physical

386
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,930
boxes rather you find Zero's even

387
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,830
cheaper the raspberry PI's it's kind of

388
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,960
the original dongle hell though because

389
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,640
you have to get the little not quite

390
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,740
micro USB Micro USB adapters in order to

391
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,340
power it and to connect things to

392
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,770
they're not super powerful you might be

393
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,660
able to use it though for the memory you

394
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,810
we brought in Kalyan and you don't need

395
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,810
the toolbox and stuff like that either

396
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:25,660
you can really build this lab out of $45

397
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,580
worth a year and plug it into a TV build

398
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,970
materials is here a couple of raspberry

399
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:39,310
PI's SD cards full box display again

400
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,040
always still ethernet cables funny

401
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:50,020
progress the the original build cost was

402
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:58,000
under $300 and the game's display - you

403
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,730
did there's ways to make this deeper and

404
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:08,500
a little more accessible but the very

405
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,820
distressing thing is that I started this

406
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,360
like four years ago now you can go buy a

407
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,160
laptop for tuner dollars to do all this

408
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,270
- need a laptop but it's not know any

409
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,800
respond and then you know how a

410
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,390
Raspberry Pi Nalepa turn into a retro

411
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:27,040
violator the software is pretty easy

412
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,350
razz me an Atlantic stack is your victim

413
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,800
server the callee are described for the

414
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,620
attack server dvwa support these guys

415
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:42,580
all these projects are open and they're

416
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:48,540
really great for training I can't thank

417
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,740
dvwa enough because they gave me

418
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,210
something that I could

419
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:57,009
and not being the right team guy you

420
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,649
know I didn't I didn't have a good idea

421
00:22:59,649 --> 00:23:01,179
of how to set something up to make it

422
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,919
intentionally lauraball other than going

423
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:05,169
and finding like Sugar CRM which is

424
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:08,820
notoriously awful and setting that up

425
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,269
and there's other other projects as well

426
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:15,159
to what you know like the Mets quarter

427
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:18,490
will be em I'd really like to take

428
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,110
everything that makes the best voidable

429
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,539
Metasploit able and then throw it on the

430
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:26,110
Raspberry Pi as well I have to thank

431
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:30,330
these guys pope from BC 801 and grifter

432
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,700
both were each help and sourcing a bunch

433
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,379
of this stuff and coming up with ideas

434
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:41,889
dvwa n hyperplane with DC 801 gave me a

435
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:46,389
Python to play with my wife's out of the

436
00:23:46,389 --> 00:23:50,279
slides because I don't like these and

437
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,820
the besides SLC her forced me to present

438
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,869
this the first time and got me up on

439
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:04,299
stage now given a to you guys I've also

440
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:08,039
given this talk it be said Raleigh and I

441
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:12,159
don't like public speaking so and this

442
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,740
is a total silent no anything that you

443
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,899
don't like the your own comfortable just

444
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:20,980
do it and force yourself and stretch so

445
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,840
that's everything for me any questions

446
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,679
you

447
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:37,120
you
