1
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,030
sweet alright

2
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,920
my name is Michael Hague and I work for

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,760
red canary we created a project thank

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,840
you

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,330
we created a project last summer so

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,210
called atomic red team and the idea of

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,360
the project is to help organizations

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,910
test their security posture and focus on

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,230
the endpoint because we're an endpoint

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,190
company and so what it is is a pretty

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,809
open there's an open source project you

12
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,550
can go and get it today it's atomic red

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,769
team title they download it and use it

14
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:42,989
so this talk is gonna highlight a lot

15
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:45,120
about that and a little bit about myself

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,220
as well so again my name is Michael

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:53,129
Hague I did not have a beard the last

18
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:55,620
year and a half we've been traveling the

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,100
country we lived in an RV for about 19

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,540
months we actually just settled here in

21
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,170
Boise and this is where we've been this

22
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,930
is our map on our RV and so we've been

23
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,850
kind of all over the place lots of

24
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,430
different states Maine and Florida our

25
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,800
idea was to find a place where we want

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:13,990
to

27
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,380
and settle and raise our kids and so

28
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,579
during that whole time we were working

29
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,619
on atomic red team and other things

30
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:24,310
within the organization but an aware

31
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,710
atomic comes from overview of this talk

32
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,720
just going to discuss why testing is

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,780
important stop making feedback come

34
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,530
roadblocks with that and look at part of

35
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,090
the tolson that we produce within the

36
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,189
project itself and hopefully the end of

37
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:40,869
this talk you walk away with the ability

38
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:42,729
to test herself within your own

39
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,140
organization and see how your posture

40
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,369
brilliance and mapping into minor attack

41
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:50,560
part of our travel we went to as he saw

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,479
a most every state one of them was

43
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,340
Nevada and Nevada actually has the

44
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,950
National atomic testing museum has

45
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,580
anybody ever been there awesome anybody

46
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:06,810
ever traveled the country in an RV so

47
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,179
this museum is great it highlights a lot

48
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:11,560
of stuff I didn't even know about atomic

49
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,269
testing and what we did in the past and

50
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:15,760
how we tested our nuclear weapons and

51
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,830
build things and blew all kinds of

52
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,829
things up and how we did it and atomic

53
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:23,940
testing for us as is not meant to be

54
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,350
make the biggest explosion in your

55
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,209
organization with atomic right team

56
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:30,609
we're not saying calling the red team

57
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,790
Colin or have your own apt or your own

58
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,280
internal pen test or whatever it may be

59
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,650
we're not looking to blow it up that

60
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,690
over there is the Trinity test site

61
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,480
that's a picture from the museum

62
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,030
but the Google Trinity test site it's

63
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,250
out in New Mexico it's how in the middle

64
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,739
of nowhere and they allow like once a

65
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,890
year tours of the actual site which was

66
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,690
this at the time was the largest atomic

67
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,300
bomb that had went on but we're not

68
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,819
going to do that with an organization

69
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:02,280
what we want to do is have more granular

70
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,500
test more single early tests where

71
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,750
you're able to test a particular part of

72
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,459
the biter attack matrix does everybody

73
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,269
heard of a minor attack okay so minor

74
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:14,670
attack minor came out with this attack

75
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,480
framework

76
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,819
it has different tactics and then

77
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,610
underneath each tactic is techniques and

78
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,140
the technique can be PowerShell

79
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,610
execution it can be registered

80
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,799
thirty-two different things built in

81
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:27,840
with Windows Mac and Linux you're able

82
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,849
to test it and with atomic read team

83
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,470
with the way we mapped it you seen a

84
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,140
little bit and you can execute simple

85
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,970
tests just like they did with atomic

86
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,190
testing and young a class so when you

87
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,930
have the flats they are instead of

88
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,420
blowing them up on land or stratospheric

89
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,400
atomic bombs they move the two

90
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,920
underground atomic testing and so they

91
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,079
did about I'm going to say eight hundred

92
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,780
and fifty different atomic tests

93
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,209
underground and so the idea is within

94
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:56,010
your organization instead of calling in

95
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,290
a pen test or red team paying lots of

96
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,030
money you can use atomic red team to

97
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,569
come in

98
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:02,670
you guys can execute it yourself perform

99
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,670
your own testing within your business so

100
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,250
the atomic test is a small one attack a

101
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,170
technique that you're able to pick you

102
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,359
want to focus on our show this week get

103
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:14,100
your team together find some PowerShell

104
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,540
techniques different methods that people

105
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,519
use it out there whatever you're seeing

106
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,370
in the wild go through that they're all

107
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,740
easy to execute most of the the most of

108
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,630
the frameworks filled out today I think

109
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,550
there's about two hundred let me say two

110
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,490
hundred and twenty

111
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,729
makes that minor attack we have about

112
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:35,620
115 and each one is very important and

113
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,090
then also to be able to measure because

114
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,289
you want to be able to take this up to

115
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:40,780
management and show them that you're

116
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,550
running these paths you're showing that

117
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,940
we have coverage little coverage or no

118
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,430
coverage on these types of techniques so

119
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,660
that's kind of the goal in this project

120
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,060
it's helped me be able to take that to

121
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,330
the top so testing your coverage is

122
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,800
fundamental to improving your security

123
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,169
outcomes the idea is that you shouldn't

124
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:02,259
have to pay 20 30 50 grand or 10 grand

125
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:04,479
for a giant test to come in and tell you

126
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,610
a point-in-time scenario about your

127
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,560
environment the idea is to continuously

128
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,560
test your organization understand what's

129
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,349
being prevented coming in and then

130
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:16,900
what's being prevented going out so it's

131
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,199
all open source and free and easy right

132
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,520
you just need to build out a quick

133
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,409
little lab and then you're more or less

134
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:28,690
get started so we all have significant

135
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,759
investment in our products I ran a

136
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,580
fortune 150 security program and it was

137
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,830
a million dollar program and tons and

138
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,469
tons of money to blow and everything but

139
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:41,229
we did it we took this approach of where

140
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:42,969
do we need coverage what's most

141
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,800
important in our program that we need to

142
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,169
have a new product and we have to buy

143
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:48,729
the product is there something built and

144
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:51,280
that we can use and so kind of like a

145
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,070
lot of paths built into why we build the

146
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,580
topic

147
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,560
this resonates with everybody on the

148
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,280
team who works with us so hope is a

149
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,080
feeling it's not a strategy we all hope

150
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,620
our products are working we all hope

151
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,850
preventing everything that they say

152
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,930
they're going to per band with their

153
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,230
moai unicorns and everything like that

154
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,160
right so this isn't my quote but I feel

155
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,020
really bad for these guys down there

156
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,690
watching this atomic blast right yeah it

157
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,800
just couldn't imagine there's other

158
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,690
pictures you ever looked at your google

159
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,970
atomic test pictures it's super

160
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,290
interesting dudes just hiding behind

161
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,340
cement barriers with military out there

162
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,440
some of the background images doing

163
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,290
those that tale so how do I know it's

164
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,350
working missing text there you test

165
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,200
yourself you know but happened there's a

166
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,760
button so we need ongoing iterative

167
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,040
testing objective measurement low buried

168
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,800
for injury introducing a tomography

169
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,280
which is guessing so it's open source

170
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,200
discrete tests all mapped to minor

171
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,900
attack framework Roberto Rodriguez

172
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,270
produced a spreadsheet you can find it

173
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,250
we have am on our blog focus and whatnot

174
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,760
his spreadsheet covers how to hunt

175
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,860
against minor attack so hunting these

176
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,090
types of techniques within your

177
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,490
environment so you're easily able to get

178
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,260
that spreadsheet execute these tests

179
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,970
with the topic red team and then you're

180
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,040
able to kind of go back and measure how

181
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,340
good or how low your covered

182
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,580
your environment so again testing super

183
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,600
important

184
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,340
who's gonna hop up because this next one

185
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,100
gets more cool all right so this is our

186
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,140
atomic red team landing page it's just

187
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,680
atomic Red Team IO and you can see all

188
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,790
the different links we have our

189
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,550
philosophy on there we do have a slack

190
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,020
group so if you're interested and is

191
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,510
just talking to people who are using it

192
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,030
how everyone's using the product and

193
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,550
then also just for discussion about new

194
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,280
techniques and yesterday we we do

195
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,950
monthly webinars called atomic Friday's

196
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,050
so yesterday we have our first second

197
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,030
atomic Friday you can join them on these

198
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,070
little webinars learn we're just talking

199
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,290
about different techniques out there

200
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,540
what else is happening I'm gonna drill

201
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,090
in this is what one of the techniques

202
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,280
look like we've broke everything out

203
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,920
into Yambol more recently yet another

204
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,320
markup language so what yan will allows

205
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,150
us to do is for organisations and other

206
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,520
people to consume all of our logic that

207
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,560
we've built into atomic right team and

208
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,870
there are markdown files which is what

209
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,970
we're going to drill into next this is

210
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,000
just tea 1117 on mitre and this is

211
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,370
register 32 we pull in all the

212
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,650
description data from from attack the

213
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,690
attack framework and then you have the

214
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,669
ability to kind of continued it down on

215
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,130
that page you see the different three

216
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,799
tests that we provide for this you can

217
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,539
add as many more as you want and that's

218
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,550
a big contributor piece to this is this

219
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,570
is highly community driven we initially

220
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,730
pushed this out with maybe 17 techniques

221
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,800
build the rest has been all community

222
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,110
and one side the community ones open a

223
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,050
issue saying hey your guys's matrix is

224
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,670
it's back to the date we're updating the

225
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,790
matrix by hand guy opens the misuses you

226
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,230
need to update the maintenance they have

227
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,939
pushed out like 30 new techniques and

228
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:07,910
we're just like okay I was on vacation

229
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,410
Casey was just kind of staring at it and

230
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,779
I'm like give me a minute it's all

231
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,689
manual so anyway the game will help out

232
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:16,980
with all the automation of building

233
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,779
these things out again you can execute

234
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,790
these there any kind of automation

235
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,269
platform you have you can literally copy

236
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:25,799
and paste this into your command line

237
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,470
execute it did your a/v triggered if

238
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,119
your firewall detect that be me cats

239
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:34,410
coming down that your any other product

240
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,939
you can think of that anybody see this

241
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:38,129
happening that's kind of the cool part a

242
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:39,449
lot of people think is very endpoint

243
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:40,799
focused I would start to challenge you

244
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,230
to look at it from the network side some

245
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,369
of these things are actually downloading

246
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:46,769
cool payloads and today AV products are

247
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:48,779
starting to just flag atomic red teeth

248
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,610
because there's a lot of interesting

249
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,420
things written in there right it doesn't

250
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,470
have to be hard it can be just as simple

251
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,989
as this tweet says it is this is Keith

252
00:10:00,989 --> 00:10:03,389
he's one of our co-founders how do you

253
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:05,509
approach testing just pick a technique

254
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:08,759
execute one of them and just see what

255
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,220
happens he even produced like a simple

256
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,629
little spreadsheet at the bottom of his

257
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:15,389
tweet and just make a simple spreadsheet

258
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:17,160
you start tracking it based on attack

259
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,290
techniques whether you detected it or

260
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,029
not whether any of your products solid

261
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:23,279
or anybody telling you about it probably

262
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,110
the most interesting is like given MSSP

263
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,950
and you go through

264
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,260
two different tack techniques phone call

265
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,130
anybody email you about it get tickets

266
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,510
more recently we saw another vendor

267
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,660
picking up atomic red team just somebody

268
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,160
accessing the webpage not even

269
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,690
downloading it they're starting to fly

270
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:47,740
people going to it and it's not even you

271
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,510
can also level up your chain reactions

272
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:53,760
this is an RV I saw out in Nevada

273
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,250
this thing is awesome that even has a

274
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,920
trailer in fact but I think he sleeps in

275
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,890
here and it just rolls up it's super

276
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:06,280
sweet so what we call chain reactions is

277
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,350
just the ability to take different parts

278
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,540
of your techniques so you want to run a

279
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,700
PowerShell you wanna run register you

280
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,350
want to do some other things some count

281
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,630
memory and some neck commands whatever

282
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,790
it may be it's just like putting Legos

283
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,120
together maybe like this heartbeat but

284
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,070
it's just like this this is a simple

285
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,740
chain reaction all we're doing is like a

286
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,320
basic floor loop doing some accountant

287
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,640
umer ation across the network

288
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,650
I'm gonna take that you know just

289
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,620
generates telemetry or traces as we call

290
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,020
them then down here we try to outline

291
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,880
everything within the table actually so

292
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,490
you know you're getting so the tactic is

293
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,070
discovery detecting the technique is

294
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,900
looking for different AV products right

295
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,730
and this is generating this those traces

296
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,100
that that telemetry within your

297
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,050
environment you know are you looking for

298
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,880
people enumerator your security software

299
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,640
are you are you picking up the fact that

300
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,470
somebody is querying your domain

301
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,230
controller out there running net use

302
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,930
commands pulling all this telemetry you

303
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,130
know are you getting all those event

304
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,930
logs are you getting all

305
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,220
those are all very interesting points to

306
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,340
be looking for the other thing we

307
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,320
recently pushed out was this roll the

308
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,990
dice you can use this with chain

309
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,730
reactions if you're just I don't know

310
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,260
where to begin with atomic red team I

311
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,690
just want to do the copy paste method

312
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,850
super awesome you can go to our Tomic

313
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,180
red team io / roll the dice everything

314
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,890
they become anything it's / I think it's

315
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,490
/ the guitarist for some reason but go

316
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,140
to roll the dice you click the button it

317
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,510
will give you a new technique of the day

318
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,589
you just keep clicking it you'll get

319
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:41,120
more and more you can start building out

320
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,500
of your chain reaction in a batch file

321
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,770
PowerShell script it's that simple or

322
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,930
just your copy paste method just brought

323
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,080
it and see what happens then more

324
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,180
recently last few months Casey and just

325
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,130
mostly Casey if a couple guys internally

326
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,950
built out the PowerShell framework for

327
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,300
atomic Red Team it's called invoke

328
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,720
atomic red team this allows for

329
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,370
execution and generation of the test

330
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,520
from all the yellow files so you want to

331
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,070
just generate all the tests you can copy

332
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,240
and paste them straight from command

333
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,980
line output to a text file whatever you

334
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,010
want to do you can generate or you can

335
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,080
actually just execute in this example

336
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,480
you just want to execute T 1117 the red

337
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,240
circle area to what execute red stick 32

338
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,910
it immediately pops your calculator and

339
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,530
you can modify the test however you want

340
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:35,199
to pop something else or actually

341
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:37,489
so very easy to do with the powershell

342
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:39,169
framework there is also a Python

343
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:41,569
framework that you can run very similar

344
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:43,369
pattern it'll generate the test and

345
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:45,889
execute the test obviously better there

346
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:47,449
are other products out there or other

347
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:51,049
open-source projects out there like meta

348
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:54,259
from uber Meadows another one that Chris

349
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:57,709
Gates had generated which uses I think

350
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:59,389
at the time he wasn't using our Yambol

351
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:00,529
file but that was one of the main

352
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:02,720
reasons why we went to gamble so that he

353
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,309
couldn't begin to ingest them into his

354
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:05,239
product

355
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:07,069
there are enterprise products out there

356
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:08,989
as well so if you want to do Enterprise

357
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:11,059
testing you can deploy agents agents

358
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,999
will execute everything for you it'll

359
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:15,319
pull back all that telemetry very

360
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:17,389
similar so this is this the open source

361
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,249
method and you can see the communities

362
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:22,729
where they're growing so biggest thing

363
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,529
is always be testing we can't trust

364
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:25,970
everything we hear there's so much

365
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,439
marketing out there in this industry and

366
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:29,809
if you go to more cons and this you'll

367
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:33,289
see a lot of it right so biggest thing

368
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,479
is just trying run it see what happens

369
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:36,739
write down what you have in your

370
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:38,479
security stack what you think should be

371
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:41,149
learning within your environment pull

372
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:43,009
down some maybe cats and just see what

373
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:44,809
happens does anybody learn on it and

374
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:47,179
we're constantly pushing and publishing

375
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:50,029
new things different hypotheses or just

376
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:52,489
different ways to run parts of atomic

377
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:55,009
Red Team on our blog and whatnot so

378
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:56,479
highly recommend checking it out and

379
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,299
join us if you feel that there should be

380
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,600
something added to Atami

381
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,610
just add it do a pull request ship it

382
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,120
over open a github issue tell us some

383
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,560
slack whatever it may be

384
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,660
we're here to help we are all atomic

385
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,210
yeah Tommy grid team IO our great canary

386
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,770
blogs down here as well you can

387
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,600
subscribe they'll ship your atomic

388
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,090
routine emails but yeah that's all there

389
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:33,759
