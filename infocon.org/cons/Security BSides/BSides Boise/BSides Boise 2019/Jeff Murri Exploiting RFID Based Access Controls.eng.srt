1
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,089
I'm rockin okay you can hear me now

2
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:14,070
though right

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,020
okay I'm gonna apologize because I'm a

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,789
wanderer so I'm going to walk in front

5
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:20,470
of the screen and do everything that

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,079
they say professional speakers shouldn't

7
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:26,050
do but yeah by way of introduction I'm

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,270
Jeff Murray actually did not live in the

9
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:28,960
valley anymore

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,200
I live in Augusta Georgia moved down

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,640
about nine years ago I think but all my

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,949
family's here and fortunately I was able

13
00:00:38,949 --> 00:00:41,829
to come up here for b-sides last year

14
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:45,430
and this year my family's here I get to

15
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,810
kill two birds with one stone and I get

16
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,930
to geek out and get to see my family so

17
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,550
it's awesome so I would argue if you're

18
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,989
not getting up to speed on hardware

19
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,760
solutions and will get into different

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,120
hardware solutions Red Team Blue Team

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,670
doesn't matter

22
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,290
the industry and the bad guys are going

23
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,259
to roll right over you by hardware I

24
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:11,290
mean things like you being able to

25
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,670
possibly check your wireless access

26
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,350
point to see if it's been owned not

27
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,079
software firm worth being able to take

28
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,959
your wireless access point dump the

29
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:27,069
firmware and reflash it build your own

30
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:29,560
wireless access points same thing walk

31
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,149
through your building and see if

32
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:33,340
somebody's sitting there with you know a

33
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,829
malicious Bluetooth device something

34
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:40,479
like that so basically what this is is

35
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,920
going to be a quick chat about hardware

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,779
hardware in general and what is

37
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:48,969
currently out there and this is just I'm

38
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:51,149
just scratching the surface but

39
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,359
ultimately grab on we're ready to go

40
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:55,899
we're going to talk about

41
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:58,090
software-defined radio we're gonna talk

42
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,969
about owning Hardware how many of you

43
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:02,700
have a PlayStation

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,849
ps3 ps4 ok ps4 has been broken if you

45
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:08,800
weren't aware of it I'm going to show

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,300
you the tool that you can use to get in

47
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,380
there and use it

48
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,370
anger basically can bus you want treat

49
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,170
you know tweak your hooptie out there I

50
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,440
have a 2003 Ford Focus one interesting

51
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,930
thing that I did is I talked about this

52
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,810
during my workshop the damage check

53
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,190
engine light used to come up Oh

54
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,260
it ran great but the oxygen sensors on

55
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,160
the port focus SVT are really expensive

56
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,440
and they burn up about every six months

57
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,020
so what I did is I create a little

58
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,920
device that hooked into the can bus port

59
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,650
and as soon as it saw the code for bad

60
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,030
oxygen sensor it sent the recent so

61
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,740
basically I wasn't bothered by the check

62
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,180
engine light and as far as I know

63
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,320
actually I haven't seen the check engine

64
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,820
light in awhile so I haven't checked my

65
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,720
code lately

66
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,430
so hopefully valid codes are coming

67
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,790
through but I'm going to show you how to

68
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:16,370
do that other USB hacking tools things

69
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,470
like that again hardware devices not

70
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,940
software stuff hardware devices and then

71
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,070
if we have time you know I know there

72
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,660
was a talk this morning on raspberry

73
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,460
PI's there's a ton ton of small

74
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,190
form-factor pcs out there now Linux

75
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,980
windows Internet of Things being run

76
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,640
Windows 10 on hardware now so I mean

77
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,800
little hardware now a little Intel

78
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,780
Edison board something like that if

79
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,850
we're going to go into that so now is it

80
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,560
time for you to bomb the nose if this

81
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,570
doesn't sound like your thing but what I

82
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,810
did do is because of the RFID this is

83
00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:00,980
dude but in honor of the talk that you

84
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,830
were hoping to probably see I did add a

85
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,830
RFID hacking tool and I did that this

86
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:13,010
morning and no you know the drill

87
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,150
now I'm going to tell you my employer

88
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,130
who cares they don't care what I do

89
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,899
after hours is what they'll break the

90
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:21,290
law same thing the big thing here is as

91
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,940
far as SDR

92
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,830
it depends on where you are whether it's

93
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,569
legal to listen to some of the stuff

94
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:30,360
that's really going through your body as

95
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,370
airwaves so long story short if you do

96
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,780
something illegal based on anything you

97
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,919
see here ain't my fault

98
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,539
okay software-defined radio so

99
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:44,490
software-defined radio I'm looking at

100
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,680
how many of you weren't in my workshop

101
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,720
yesterday okay know what it was a Friday

102
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,530
I understand so software-defined radio

103
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,569
think of the radio with tubes and all

104
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:04,379
that or a car radio from your hooptie

105
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:09,080
car from the 1990s transistors or tubes

106
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,969
what-have-you software-defined radio has

107
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:15,710
taken all of that circuitry that

108
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,360
demodulates that frequency modulated or

109
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,259
FM signal AM signal all of that put it

110
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,449
into hardware or software so basically

111
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:29,190
what a radio is now even in the newer

112
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,050
cars is it is taking the analog signal

113
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,819
going through the air converting it to

114
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:37,860
ones and zeros and that's where the

115
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,900
radio stops everything else isn't

116
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,229
software what would be the advantage to

117
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:47,490
that being able to configure it tune it

118
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,620
if you can get access to the firmware or

119
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,300
in this case this RTL SDR dongle this

120
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,759
guy here was originally designed for TV

121
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,659
reception an enterprising Russian

122
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,490
they're pretty crafty sometimes an

123
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,490
enterprising Russian said hey it doesn't

124
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,529
have to be used just for TV because it's

125
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:11,250
taking analog radio waves converting it

126
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,789
into ones and zeros so I'll write a

127
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:17,550
driver then takes this dongle and I

128
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,639
thought you guys I got

129
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,240
right over there and be a software

130
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,270
decode FM radio AM radio a cars you know

131
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,580
FlightAware some of those websites out

132
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,979
there it's scary as hell that you can

133
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:35,860
see where every aircraft is now well how

134
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,210
that's getting there is a

135
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,300
software-defined radio listening to the

136
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,770
transponder information coming from

137
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,740
airplanes you can do that for free you

138
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,009
can do that with a twenty dollar TV

139
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:53,139
dongle the mice my slides from the

140
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:56,560
workshop yesterday will be posted Monday

141
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,289
I think and you can just walk the dog on

142
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:03,360
it so really easy so for under 20 bucks

143
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,800
you know your own software-defined radio

144
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,120
and you're able to see from 30 megahertz

145
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,870
up to about 1.8 gigahertz that's a lot

146
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,990
of spectrum yesterday we were looking at

147
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,979
pager signals pager signals like the

148
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:22,360
ones at the hospital here are not

149
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,389
encrypted you would not believe what's

150
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:29,139
coming over those paper signals you want

151
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:31,389
to see your stats clear down to what

152
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:35,020
diseases you have so there listen to the

153
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,589
pager signals

154
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:40,060
okay so software-defined radio the

155
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,949
rtl-sdr basically kicked off the

156
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:46,960
software-defined radio as we know it the

157
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,879
barrier to entry before him

158
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,649
was right around 1200 bucks

159
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:59,939
once the $20 so we should hit then a

160
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:02,469
bunch of other folks decided and bunch

161
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:04,899
of other companies decided hey we can

162
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:06,580
come up with solutions that are probably

163
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,189
a little bit more expensive but have

164
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:12,009
fine or tuning more filtering things

165
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:14,740
like that one problem with the RTOS VR

166
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,870
is that if you have a strong radio

167
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,469
station next to you know adjacent to

168
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:21,729
where you're sitting and actually

169
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:23,800
receiving a signal sometimes it can

170
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,469
actually crowd that signal out so you're

171
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:29,560
hearing a radio station at like 40

172
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,350
megahertz

173
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:35,390
when it should be it 88 - what 118 so a

174
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,240
lot of what's going on here is either

175
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,270
broadening out okay so the funk you've

176
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:46,580
Dumbo Pro 150 kilohertz up to 1.9

177
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,020
gigahertz SDR play one kilohertz up to

178
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,390
two gigahertz and then hack RF that

179
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,920
would transmits is spread out for a

180
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,430
while

181
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,830
Michael Osman who is a rock star when it

182
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,740
comes to hardware 10 megahertz up to 6

183
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,200
gigahertz will transmit its milliwatts

184
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,170
but you can actually transmit one of the

185
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,230
things that they were doing at blackhat

186
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,110
a couple years ago was confusing phones

187
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,490
because they were modulating GPS signals

188
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,810
so sitting there with your phone right

189
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,820
next to a hack RF it was saying you were

190
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,430
in Lithuania so line STR this is a new

191
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:33,590
one and it transmitted and it's got gets

192
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:38,420
ran around 1 watt which is a lot and if

193
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,300
you look at the prices of these Lima SDR

194
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,070
$2.99 they just come out with a mini

195
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,960
version for 149 hack RF $2.99 and then

196
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,150
you know it goes down from there so

197
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,830
there's a lot of them out there the only

198
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:55,970
thing I would caution you on is these

199
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:02,390
are really cheap on Alibaba drawing a

200
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,540
blank on some of those Chinese tiny

201
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,390
sites or just eBay you get what you pay

202
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,580
for sometimes buy from somebody that has

203
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,410
a lot of new positives and you know they

204
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,810
instead of you know a bunch of negatives

205
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,980
this thing sucked it didn't have

206
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,480
anything inside the plastic panel

207
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,800
something like that but in short the

208
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,350
barrier to entry has came way down so

209
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,750
GSM you can decode GSM now you can

210
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,880
create your own GSM base station out of

211
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,720
alignment see our

212
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:45,279
pretty cool stuff okay as far as

213
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,470
software I did this just I did this in

214
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,810
here just because this is free it's

215
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,490
called SDR sharp why would you think

216
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,970
it's called SDR sharp because it's

217
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,759
written in C sharp excellent

218
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,620
it's close source now used to be open

219
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,440
source HD SDR is open source so if you

220
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,360
want to roll your own software find

221
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,579
radio application you can take his code

222
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:09,100
and do so you can schedule recordings

223
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,500
here which is actually pretty cool with

224
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,230
HD SDR so if you know that the ISS the

225
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,670
International Space Station is going to

226
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,310
be flying over your house it you know

227
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,980
between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. then you can

228
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,800
actually have HDS star HD SVR running on

229
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,139
your laptop your computer what have you

230
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:32,259
and then it turns on records for an hour

231
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,079
turns off you wake up figure out what's

232
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:37,810
going on or in a lot of cases what I've

233
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,819
used this for is digital

234
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:43,600
I just want to record overnight 10

235
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,519
megahertz worth of spectrum and see

236
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,870
what's there so I'm gonna - radio

237
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,269
operator I like to know what's going on

238
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:54,819
with ham radio satellites so another

239
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:58,569
reason to record that spectrum but

240
00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:03,100
either app works pretty well now if

241
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,670
you're if you're a baller and have a map

242
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:11,110
or yeah basically Matt they're still

243
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,579
expensive aren't they no the Mac people

244
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:17,819
are like

245
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,770
both story short you can get the raw

246
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,460
rtl-sdr software the the russian guy and

247
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,220
the grip that he belongs to you can

248
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,550
actually turn around and download that

249
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,380
actually running the raw software hat v

250
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,600
dot org you're not a security guy unless

251
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,660
you least watch hat hat v or vo a couple

252
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,589
times they have a great video on the

253
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:46,760
rtl-sdr the $20 dongle and using the the

254
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,610
original software from the command line

255
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,190
both linux and mac gqr x it's

256
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,730
open-source it works very well so we're

257
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,540
talking free software at a minimum a $20

258
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,760
TV dongle and you've got

259
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,200
software-defined radio that you can

260
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,860
listen to signals analog signals plus

261
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:12,500
decode digital signals pagers etc water

262
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,149
meters one thing that we did yesterday

263
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:18,770
during the workshop as I showed a packet

264
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,570
capture I call it a packet capture

265
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,940
because those air waves are still layer

266
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,760
one right in the OSI model its layer 1

267
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,990
but somebody near my mother's house has

268
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,200
a weather station so I actually finished

269
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,000
the decoding of it for those of you that

270
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,900
were my workshop and it's just sending

271
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,680
Peaks modulates peaks and up is a one

272
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,080
nothings at zero and it's just spaced

273
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,570
out every half second you can decode his

274
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,330
weather station because I'm cheap down

275
00:13:53,330 --> 00:14:01,040
by water station but pretty cheap

276
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,000
okay also on Linux and Mac if you really

277
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,610
get into it good new radio it's a beast

278
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,010
and make sure your laptop has some

279
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,650
horsepower it does compile under windows

280
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,650
but I would not recommend that just bite

281
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,030
the bullet download a Linux distribution

282
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,150
that already has the compiled optimized

283
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:26,270
in has all the plugins and just run it

284
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:30,620
but Michael Osman get Rockstar

285
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,190
he has written some very thorough some

286
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:38,240
of them are two hours of tutorials to

287
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,400
really get in and just start decoding

288
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,860
signals with the raw softener ballot

289
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,910
ballot Sieber he he's excellent to his

290
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,710
videos are all out there on the youtubes

291
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,270
and then he's written a bunch of

292
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:57,350
tutorials off of them so pretty much

293
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,550
there's a solution as far as

294
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:04,370
software-defined radio from $20 to I

295
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,410
wouldn't spend more than a thousand I

296
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,660
wouldn't spend more than five hundred

297
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,720
free software barrier to entry is very

298
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,290
small because you would not believe and

299
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,850
we were having this discussion during my

300
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,520
workshops what is actually going through

301
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,860
the air now it's crazy well going

302
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:28,580
through you okay so as far as hardware

303
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,650
exploration or I would say possible

304
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,280
exploitation there is a little USB

305
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,800
dongle made by Travis good speed if if

306
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,090
Einstein and a silicon chip had a baby

307
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,390
it would be Travis good speed I made

308
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,740
that up on the fly and it was really

309
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:55,910
stupid anyway the good fit' sent him an

310
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,389
email he'll send you the PCB for about

311
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:02,779
five dollars in parts from digi-key or

312
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:04,639
any electronic supplier you get insider

313
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,570
your own it is SMD parts so any of you

314
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,339
that have soldered those little SMD

315
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:12,350
parts you know where you sneeze and all

316
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,889
your parts just went all over the place

317
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:17,600
some of you are laughing because you've

318
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,130
done it too but if you want he'll send

319
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,240
you a PCB for free

320
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,850
in fact he's looking at a revision of

321
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,290
the PCB so last time I sent him I threw

322
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,089
him five bucks just for shipping because

323
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:34,250
a lot of people can't afford shipping

324
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,709
send him five bucks and he sent me

325
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:42,050
thirty PCBs do it thirty PCB though I

326
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,870
need was one but if you want to actually

327
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,880
buy one Adafruit for $49 so what does

328
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,630
this guy do what this guy does is he's

329
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,000
got a lot of pin outs on him that allow

330
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,430
you to hook up to the chips on a

331
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,040
motherboard itself and then start

332
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,649
actually tampering with signals one of

333
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:06,020
the things that we can do even if the

334
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,559
chip is and the firmware is encrypted is

335
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,179
we can do something called a side

336
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:13,609
channel attack what that is is we glitch

337
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:16,609
it and by glitching it what we do is we

338
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:19,760
we actually stop the power real clip to

339
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,839
a couple quick to a couple of pins and

340
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,240
see what it does and eventually

341
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,179
sometimes we can catch that cycle in the

342
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:31,340
chip the crypto running in the

343
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,760
background glitch it and then get in

344
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,510
dump the firmware so that's just one

345
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,070
thing that you can do with this I

346
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,840
program a ton of different little

347
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,320
devices with the good FET a lot a lot of

348
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,650
information out there great tool $49 or

349
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:55,809
hang on your soldering skills very cheap

350
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,820
okay yardstick 1 this is kind of

351
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,340
software-defined radio but Michael Osman

352
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,679
would say it's not this is a sub 1

353
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,919
gigahertz tool and it covers transmit

354
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,340
and receive in the isn bet so these are

355
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,120
bands that are open the the FCC said

356
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,850
low-power again like the weather

357
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,710
stations things like that don't need

358
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,169
licensing as long as you don't broadcast

359
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:23,659
above this and you submit a test report

360
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:24,860
that says you're not going to bleed all

361
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,169
over everything else

362
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:30,409
so what this guy does from 300 and 300

363
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:35,840
340 a 391 464 782 to 928 it allows you

364
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,720
to actually go in and be a Python

365
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,090
command line send packets radio packets

366
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,770
to hardware devices again wireless

367
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,610
access point weather station nest

368
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,370
thermostat you know those had a big

369
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,409
vulnerability a while back you know you

370
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:56,450
want texture net nest thermostat get one

371
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,299
of those guys or if you want to just

372
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:01,460
listen to the traffic and see if you can

373
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,710
decode it $20 rtl-sdr but does all these

374
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:10,730
different modulation schemes and RF cat

375
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,820
is the firmware comes pre flashed with

376
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,350
it you can actually build one of these

377
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,659
two they'll send you a PCB I would not

378
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:20,409
advise you to do that I gave up I

379
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,490
thought I was going to build one I

380
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,130
wasn't but again there's a link on every

381
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,270
one of these slides to further

382
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,340
information because I obviously don't

383
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,970
have time to go into every one of them

384
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,340
uber teeth so the uber tooth is

385
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,029
dedicated to Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low

386
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:41,710
Energy it's nothing transmit and receive

387
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:45,320
so a friend of mine gave me these really

388
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,559
cool earbuds and they had a little heart

389
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,429
rate sensor in there so I fired up my my

390
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:58,130
uber tooth and just hit play watching a

391
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,720
whole bunch of Bluetooth devices bounce

392
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,900
back and forth everything and I see

393
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,590
this one that says Jeff's Fitbit and I

394
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,830
see another one that just says had a

395
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,410
kind of a scramble name I would quite

396
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,000
really sure I think it was maybe some

397
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,470
binary thing that it was throwing so

398
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:19,240
record then I just sit there and I start

399
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,680
watching it go through there's my heart

400
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,430
rate and a bunch of other values that I

401
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,680
will go into but I mean like blood

402
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,360
pressure things like that I thought it

403
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,040
was just a heart rate monitor but it's

404
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,660
got there's the tracking blood pressure

405
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,540
everything is not encrypted now the

406
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,240
thing is is somebody like me I don't

407
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,700
care if anybody go god damn he's in a

408
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,490
heart attack pretty soon I know but but

409
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,250
realistically some people don't want

410
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,650
somebody to just sit there and sniff

411
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,050
that type of information you know it's

412
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,180
an invasion of privacy a lot of people

413
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,010
get pretty freaked out about that it's

414
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:56,170
in the clear you do that with your

415
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:01,150
imagers 119 Adafruit has something very

416
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,510
similar this now you go to adafruit.com

417
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:08,260
that it's right around $20 but it's not

418
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,440
as fast so you may actually lose

419
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,690
Bluetooth packets but it'll get you

420
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,460
there and then if you're like well I

421
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,130
know I'm missing packets then you know

422
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,980
go for the dedicated tool but it's not

423
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,980
software-defined radio because it's

424
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,730
dedicated to a specific purpose

425
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,860
Bluetooth and decoding really to package

426
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,440
whereas again those software-defined

427
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,320
radio devices it runs the gamut

428
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:44,360
okay in order of the the speaker that

429
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,260
you wanted to see you want to hack RFID

430
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,110
tags and RFID readers all those smart

431
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,679
cards proxmark three they're up to

432
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:57,620
revision for this is they have an entire

433
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,350
kit or they have one that's just the

434
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,480
reader and a couple of cards that you

435
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,460
can then program but this will actually

436
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,550
allow you to take a card hold it up

437
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,730
against it and you just close the card

438
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,380
so pretty easy and then you can either

439
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,530
haul this thing around or you can burn a

440
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,290
copy of the card and then you've got a

441
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:21,800
copy of that person's card so there is

442
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,410
some basic crypto and a lot of that off

443
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,260
RFID stuff but for the most part it's

444
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,870
wide open and the problem is is the spec

445
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,500
that it's based on there's so many

446
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,900
devices out there there's no way they're

447
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,160
gonna be able to get all those devices

448
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,000
fixed

449
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,720
I mean hotels there was a big you know I

450
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,670
live in Augusta Georgia right now and

451
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:47,630
Atlanta had a big string of hotel room

452
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,480
steps and what they had been doing is

453
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,470
actually cloning RFID cars you sit there

454
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,660
in the bar set their little device right

455
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,020
there next to the person's hotel key and

456
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,730
the way they went

457
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,620
very very cool again can pretend to be a

458
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,000
reader or a tag or if you're I think now

459
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,820
if you're within eight inches of the

460
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,770
card it will send are up to it and wait

461
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,429
for a response back so you can clone it

462
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:23,929
without even actually touching the car

463
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:29,410
so pretty cool yes

464
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,840
well so like so for instance like at a

465
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,150
corporation if I clone to card I could

466
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,770
just sit there yeah I'm going to scam my

467
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,960
way in the thing is is even most the

468
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,200
ones that you have to swipe with enough

469
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,900
power coming from one of these devices

470
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,230
it will actually just talk through the

471
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,990
chip anyway or talk through the the

472
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:05,340
reader anyway so just because maybe

473
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,790
you've got a reader at your corporation

474
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:12,030
or what have you and it's really hard to

475
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,160
kind of get around to it to swipe it

476
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,250
doesn't matter these are very easy you

477
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,110
can actually solder an amp onto this guy

478
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:23,360
and be probably 12 13 inches away and

479
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,830
just open the door from there you're

480
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:29,750
just not skipping a beat so physical

481
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,580
when it comes to the RFID tags and the

482
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:38,070
RFID readers the the physical securing

483
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,200
the physical reader itself really

484
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,880
doesn't help you much for a determinant

485
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,570
determined individual answer your

486
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,620
question okay

487
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,610
okay we had a workshop on this yesterday

488
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,700
those of you that weren't there you can

489
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,110
ask some of the people that were there I

490
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,220
don't know if it went well or not but

491
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:06,020
nobody left which is kind of a good

492
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,910
thing either they're like oh yeah and

493
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,580
you're doing something else on there or

494
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,530
whatever but lolly short of it

495
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,140
you've got the eight to sixty-six chip

496
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,470
and then ESP 30 to chip the difference

497
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,230
the eight two six six is about the size

498
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:25,760
of my pinky nail does 802 dot 11 a BGN

499
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,030
and then can also you can see the pins

500
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,030
on the side here can actually access

501
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,470
those those pins so things like running

502
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,840
a motor stepper motor reading a

503
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,310
temperature sensor what I mentioned

504
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,110
yesterday in the workshop was a buddy of

505
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,520
mine has actually designed a complete

506
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,720
sprinkler system around esp8266 chips so

507
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,610
he's got a web interface that they all

508
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:56,140
talked to but then and he can talk via

509
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,960
Wi-Fi to these devices but essentially

510
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,660
what it's doing is he's got a moisture

511
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,720
sensor stuck into the ground and then

512
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,540
he's got another one that is a heat

513
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,880
sensor so basically it's it's day or ass

514
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,170
night Georgia gets hot and so the key

515
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,060
thing is is he wants to water his lawn

516
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,970
when the moisture is at a certain level

517
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,500
and then you doesn't want to do it

518
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,360
during the day because he's one of those

519
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,550
guys that says that prize is long and

520
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,990
everything you know he's everything's

521
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,950
perfect in his long but you can do

522
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,440
everything from that to one things that

523
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,740
we did yesterday was a captive portal

524
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,720
wireless access point you connect to it

525
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,680
and then it captures a dns request that

526
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,100
your computer's sending and redirects

527
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,220
you to the web page on that captive

528
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,890
portal all on this guy

529
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:55,300
these guys are cheap 11 bucks

530
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,170
can run on a lipo battery how many of

531
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,840
you were here last year okay for those

532
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,700
of you who were here last year you've

533
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,300
got this and a beautiful set up the bags

534
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,740
they had last year was the best value

535
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,720
I've ever seen at any con I've been to a

536
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,610
lot of them running off three double A

537
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,670
batteries everything you need to do

538
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,920
pretty much everything that I was just

539
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,990
talking about as far as a weatherproof

540
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,460
weatherproof container and everything

541
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,410
else they gave it to you

542
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:30,430
last year the ESP 32 it's a follow on

543
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:33,010
chip it does not replace it it's a

544
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,840
little bit more expensive this thing is

545
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,140
gonna be about 15 bucks mount it on this

546
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,370
board but it also does bluetooth 2.0 so

547
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,920
Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy so

548
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,960
you can actually throw this guy into

549
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,660
promiscuous mode he's got a dual-core

550
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,830
processor it's running at 1.2 gigahertz

551
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:57,520
again about the size of my thumb so I

552
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:03,100
would highly encourage you again evil

553
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,680
twin or evil made the tax man in the

554
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,800
middle attacks at hacker Halton last

555
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,050
year we had a bunch of 18 6 sixes all

556
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:14,680
over the Hyatt Hotel in Atlanta and it's

557
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,850
a Hyatt and there was a space between

558
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:23,050
the tea and the tea public and people

559
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,360
working connecting to it all at time we

560
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,770
had a little forum in there they would

561
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,450
type in their last name then it would

562
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,540
hand them off to the real one wants dad

563
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,820
in jail but ultimately it was a

564
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,400
proof-of-concept and what are you gonna

565
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,720
do about something like that

566
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,090
I mean without having a radius server

567
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,950
you know etc I mean there's ways to

568
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:49,120
secure wireless but it's not practical

569
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,760
for a public hotel and a lot of those

570
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,110
you know a bunch of other installation

571
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,640
again my workshop slide deck will be up

572
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,690
shortly and

573
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,960
can read all about that I've got a bunch

574
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,710
they've got a bunch to give away and you

575
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:13,539
can go to town take ten bus again

576
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:15,970
one thing that the ESB 32 board also has

577
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,659
is it supports the complete can bus

578
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:21,340
language all you need to do is actually

579
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,070
get the cabling and power it and that

580
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:27,580
ESP 32 can talk can to your car yeah and

581
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,480
that's what I use

582
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,039
just shut the damn check engine light

583
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:34,720
off of my car you there used to be and

584
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,250
there still is a bunch of Arduino

585
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,139
shields a bunch of other stuff that you

586
00:29:38,139 --> 00:29:39,490
could buy and it's still out there

587
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,250
just get yourself a DSP 32 board and

588
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,350
then some cables and download some code

589
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,240
that somebody else wrote on the internet

590
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,000
if you improve it send it better code to

591
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,620
him that's the way open-source works

592
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:55,600
right perfect okay some other notable

593
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,659
devices based answer if you really want

594
00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:03,159
to dive into USB buzzing and USB testing

595
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:06,279
hardware testing then based answer

596
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:09,039
allows you to take a device by the way

597
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:13,509
this is how the ps4 got hacked and prior

598
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:16,389
to that the there was an Xbox model that

599
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:17,019
got hacked

600
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:19,690
USB into the faced answer from the base

601
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,710
dancer into the computer and any Python

602
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,509
app or anything that you run on your

603
00:30:25,509 --> 00:30:29,169
computer looks like a USB endpoint plus

604
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:31,360
you can blast it the other way and see

605
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,059
how badly that USB device screamed

606
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,440
okay there's a link for you as far as

607
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,710
examples cetera and then we got some

608
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,470
links of gogo here so when you you want

609
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:51,290
to download the slides pretty much

610
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:54,020
everything that I talked about as far as

611
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,240
examples things like that explanations

612
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,580
are all here and I've been blinking red

613
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:03,070
for a minute so I think that's it

614
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,230
so we got like maybe a minute and a half

615
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,750
for questions

616
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:13,690
any questions yes

617
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:22,940
yeah you all should have said it'd be up

618
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,559
here with the cameras this one in

619
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,580
particular is pretty cool this guy

620
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:33,080
hacker Arsenal I actually can't

621
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,260
pronounce his name but he had an $80.00

622
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,280
custom device the was built off in the

623
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,150
SP 32 board and did everything from

624
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:48,080
man-in-the-middle attacks to custom

625
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,110
corals etc the cool thing is is that he

626
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:54,500
did one run of them and when he ran out

627
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,809
of them he posted the firmware up so

628
00:31:56,809 --> 00:31:58,610
that you can download the firmware flash

629
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:02,480
your PSP 32 device that you buy for 15

630
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,080
20 bucks and I say 15 to 20 bucks

631
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,340
because again you get what you pay for

632
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,799
sometimes with this stuff from China and

633
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:17,080
make your own device so Hardware again

634
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,549
software's cool being able to sit there

635
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:20,990
and you know whatever

636
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,780
everybody's watched mr. robot he does

637
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,350
more hardware they does software so if

638
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:30,020
you are not integrating Hardware into

639
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,510
both your red team and your blue team e8

640
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,600
266 drop those all over the place who's

641
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,100
connecting to them somebody I don't know

642
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,260
where he went it has a beautiful sketch

643
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,380
or application that he flashed to is a

644
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,390
266 and he's watching every single

645
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:50,780
beacon frame even hidden SS IDs you can

646
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,010
drop that thing out in the middle of

647
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:52,580
nowhere

648
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,309
connect to it be a webpage download the

649
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:57,980
text file you're good to go

650
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,240
and you know them all over your campus

651
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:09,610
and set up a mesh so poor-man's IDs

652
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:13,320
