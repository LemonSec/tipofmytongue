1
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,860
they're not just consumer products IOT

2
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,470
czar ending up in enterprise enterprises

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,320
and they're typically you know think

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,119
about you're thinking of like what

5
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:26,400
Amazon echo you think of nest

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,320
thermostats and then you also are

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,168
thinking about printers right because

8
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:35,949
because probably the most common IOT

9
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:37,870
device that's on these networks and use

10
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,210
five by people are printers and

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,340
historically these devices are typically

12
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,820
left out of policies for manageability

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,670
and security and monitoring stuff so

14
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,520
let's jump into this I'm going to talk

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,989
about the threat landscape this is the

16
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:55,840
fun part this is the part I love okay we

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,710
know cybersecurity is a disruptive force

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,910
some of the numbers that we've got

19
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,550
worldwide cyber crime would be a six

20
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,090
trillion dollar problem by 2021 the 2016

21
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,200
data 1,700 significant this sooner

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,320
really loaded me when I first saw this

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,680
1700 so but notice it says significant

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,580
now how how many of you guys remember

25
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,070
the Reagan era okay so I think there's a

26
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,180
lot of there's some people in here that

27
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,729
weren't even born then okay and during

28
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:31,350
the Reagan era the National Defense

29
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,340
organization

30
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,450
defensive tech security in the US they

31
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,170
had on average about 8,000 attack cyber

32
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:49,579
attacks a year okay 8,000 today so by

33
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:51,409
the way Reagan was back in the 80s okay

34
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:55,369
guys today it went from eight thousand a

35
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:55,880
year

36
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,720
eight million attacks okay on the US

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,179
government eight million okay this this

38
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:04,280
just blew my mind when I heard this so

39
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,420
it is happening and it's not good so we

40
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,000
know that the adversaries are evolving

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,880
okay and why and how their attack

42
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,100
sophistication is increasing not

43
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,230
necessarily because the individual is

44
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,540
becoming more sophisticated but because

45
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,930
the tools that these bad guys are

46
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,730
developing these hackers are developing

47
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,250
they're they're sold on the darknet you

48
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,260
can go on you can go on the darknet buy

49
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,630
these tools that are readily available

50
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,370
for hacking into systems you know

51
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,739
there's there the eternal blue one right

52
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,090
that happened on that was back on

53
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,790
windows 7 eternal blue scripts where

54
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,100
that and code there's tools that are

55
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,519
developed by and for hackers Metasploit

56
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,410
how many people have used math boy yeah

57
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,450
okay great reverse engineering tool

58
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,549
right we use it for testing you should

59
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:56,720
be using for you can use it for

60
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,850
penetration testing without developed by

61
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,390
a hacker

62
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,420
okay Ida Pro same similar concept Ida

63
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,549
Pro is developed by a hacker it's sold

64
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:06,769
commercially now so these tools that are

65
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,380
being developed there they're developed

66
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,760
by hackers and they're being bought and

67
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,310
sold for hackers

68
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,489
you know they're being utilized so I'm

69
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:18,829
in the manufacturing space for our

70
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:21,890
printers what can we do to counteract

71
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,170
these attacks the sophistication of

72
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,239
attacks well I'm going to get into more

73
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,969
details about what we mean by we have to

74
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:31,969
be build resilient devices what does

75
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:33,799
that mean it's got that there's actually

76
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:35,269
a definition and there's a new

77
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:37,159
specification that we'll talk about in a

78
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,439
second but essentially resilience means

79
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,349
that you can protect yourself to the

80
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:44,810
degree that you can in the event that

81
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,370
you cannot protect against everything

82
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,739
you need to detect certain things in

83
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:50,989
certain anomalies that may be in your

84
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:52,879
devices that are occurring and then

85
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,159
recover the resiliency is the ability to

86
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:59,719
recover so let's look at what we I love

87
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:02,359
this one these are destructive attacks

88
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:04,519
okay destructive attacks are out there

89
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,290
to actually damage data damage companies

90
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,200
you know bring them down it's a loss of

91
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,139
revenue it's a loss of data if you look

92
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:17,238
the one that I like them you know this

93
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:22,190
Shamoon 2012 hugely devastated saudi

94
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,530
aramco one of the big oil refineries in

95
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,560
saudi arabia okay so i heard this story

96
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,840
from mafia boy he was the guy that

97
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,400
brought down the walls you know brought

98
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,419
down Wall Street back in the 90s so

99
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:38,000
imagine you're in your company you're an

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,310
IT guy you get an email from a friend

101
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,259
looks like it's from a friend it says

102
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:44,990
click this link okay this guy

103
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,360
this is Shamu

104
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,009
well this guy clicked the link and a

105
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:54,650
picture of the us-american fight comes

106
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,129
up on his screen and it starts burning

107
00:04:57,129 --> 00:05:00,530
okay and as it's burning people are

108
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,050
getting up inside the company going what

109
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,979
the heck is going on so it brought down

110
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:09,050
30,000 pcs in a matter of minutes

111
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,150
because what it did is if they basically

112
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,520
overrode the Master Boot Record and you

113
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,319
couldn't you could not bring those pcs

114
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,240
back there you have to they had to go

115
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,789
and walk to each one and reinstall the

116
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:22,280
BIOS reinstall the operating system and

117
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,259
God forbid if you haven't backed up your

118
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:26,960
data it was gone so a huge impact to

119
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,020
Saudi Aramco during that time the other

120
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,030
one I'll point out is that the Ukrainian

121
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,569
Power Group so this one about a quarter

122
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,449
of a million people in the Ukraine there

123
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:41,000
were without power for hours and what's

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,409
interesting about this one

125
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,840
it was the reconnaissance that was done

126
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,900
before the attack these hackers spent

127
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,719
months collecting information collecting

128
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,060
passwords you know and through phishing

129
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,009
attacks or various means but they

130
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:56,690
basically gathered all this

131
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,639
reconnaissance information and the

132
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,930
logistics of it

133
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,000
we're just if you look at how they

134
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,280
attacked it with it

135
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,230
within minutes a quarter of a million

136
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,330
people without power it's just

137
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,670
impressive very impressive some of these

138
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,280
other ones are going to talk about

139
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,980
Mariah was an IOT device IO T attack and

140
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,230
so with Reapers I'm going to get into a

141
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,650
little bit more details about those but

142
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,510
you know you can kind of see wanna cry

143
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,200
Petya those were grand somewhere and you

144
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,630
ran some orders where essentially it

145
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,950
encrypts all the data you guys know

146
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,300
there's like crypts all the data right

147
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,010
and if you pay the ransom supposedly

148
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,620
you'll get you know the key that outs

149
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,390
you decrypt it do you know what most

150
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,220
instances when somebody paid the ransom

151
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,200
they got nothing they got nothing back

152
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,230
and and then not Petiot was specifically

153
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,050
I'm gonna just screwed screwed through

154
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,300
all the data on your PC and forget about

155
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,130
a ransom I don't need that I just want

156
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,100
to you know distract cause you know rap

157
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,890
the destruction of this information so I

158
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,590
do I want to keep moving quickly here

159
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,380
but NSA did a presentation of RSA this

160
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,680
year so basically this is the these

161
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,660
statistics are so kind of mind-boggling

162
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,690
right so ninety-three percent of the

163
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,690
2017 incidents were preventable with

164
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,370
best practices what type of best

165
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,720
practices are they talking about

166
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,610
hardening endpoints like setting

167
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,190
passwords closing ports and hardening

168
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,860
your network okay so 93 percent could

169
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,150
have been you prevent it very easily and

170
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,030
then the 90 percent of cyber incidents

171
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,530
are due to human error

172
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,419
human error they either inadvertently or

173
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,940
purposefully do this

174
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,620
the perk down on the bottom which is

175
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,310
sort of interesting about this NSA has

176
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,360
not responded to an intrusion using

177
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,939
zero-day exploit in the last 24 months

178
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:50,990
so zero day exploits are new new attacks

179
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,599
right new attack vectors what that means

180
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,780
is and this is the part that just as

181
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,449
amazing is that they are using existing

182
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:00,469
hacks

183
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:03,110
okay so what's old is new again that

184
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,360
eternal blue some of the existing hacks

185
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,189
that are out there they're getting the

186
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:08,930
tools on the darknet and they're

187
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,370
attacking devices because they're not

188
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,680
updated you know Microsoft came out with

189
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,800
you know fixes for a lot of these facts

190
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,009
and other other devices did as will we

191
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:21,740
on printers we have a hard time getting

192
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,560
our customers to update their devices we

193
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,990
are fixing security vulnerabilities in

194
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,629
our products issuing security bulletins

195
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:33,320
and issuing new firmware and about 70

196
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,299
percent of the time they're not updating

197
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,399
their devices so you know these are in

198
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,599
points that are going to be on your

199
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,679
network and they're putting your

200
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,620
infrastructure at risk right this is

201
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,950
another telling one about a cyber

202
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,079
security agent from the FBI actually

203
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:52,640
this base turn Boise 70% of the time the

204
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,339
device on the company's network hardly

205
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:56,990
cause that initial breach is unknown

206
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,820
what does that mean they weren't

207
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,769
monitoring those devices and in most

208
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:03,820
instances that's an IOT device

209
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,730
during them how many customers are

210
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,190
monitoring their thermostats that if

211
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,930
they're you know the smarts thermostats

212
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,120
or their printers or any of these

213
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,610
devices and yet they can be used to

214
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,350
attack an outlet and bring it down

215
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,340
so IOT is the weakest link you know

216
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,570
there's a big predict seventy-five

217
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,450
billion units of IOT devices will be out

218
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,120
there they're there grantees are playing

219
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,770
with security flaws there's boner

220
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,750
abilities in those in them there's weak

221
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,880
default passwords lack of software

222
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,310
updates they're not you have to actually

223
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,610
have these updates occur and make sure

224
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,950
that they're timely and they're applied

225
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,110
to the device and then we have these

226
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,850
distributed denial of service attacks

227
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,200
where they're using these devices as

228
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,330
botnets and essentially bringing down

229
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,300
the network and I've got a couple of

230
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,880
examples infect the next one was let's

231
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,950
get to that but a lot of the device

232
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,660
manufacturers don't make security a

233
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,430
priority and that's why these devices

234
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,730
are targets of attack so arrived did you

235
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,350
how many guys have heard of Mariah

236
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,210
and where I attack okay yeah brought

237
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,640
down the internet on the eastern

238
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,590
seaboard so people could not get to

239
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,770
their you know favorite web sites out

240
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,510
there

241
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,400
Mariah actually attacked 2.5 million

242
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,270
devices and and what they targeted were

243
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,250
you know security cameras DVRs and

244
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,080
Printers printers were included in that

245
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,150
they looked for devices that didn't have

246
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,100
passwords that they're just blank rights

247
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,770
only do have default passwords

248
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,260
the default password is like no topspin

249
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,240
at all it doesn't take you very long to

250
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,300
figure out what it is and they found

251
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,110
these devices they were running SSH or

252
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,320
telnet

253
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,330
and weak passwords that boom they could

254
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,090
inject their color right into him and

255
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,120
they basically brought down created a

256
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,130
distributed denial-of-service on the DNS

257
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,620
server the dining DNS server so people

258
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,000
couldn't find get to their websites

259
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,250
without with no DNS you can't use a

260
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,800
hostname to get to a server right this

261
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,580
is the other one Reaper IOT botnet

262
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,830
effects networks okay this the reason

263
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,840
this one's a little scary is that you

264
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,580
don't know that you've been infected and

265
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,960
these these these these little malware

266
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,820
on these devices is sitting there and

267
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,610
the one thing that the malware typically

268
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,530
does when its installed on an infected

269
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,510
devices that tries to phone home to its

270
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,720
commanding control center right and so

271
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,820
it's exchanging information externally

272
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,640
and asking what do I want to do they're

273
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,930
predicting that this could potentially

274
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,410
be there waiting for enough devices that

275
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,120
they can utilize to create this

276
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,480
distributed denial-of-service so and the

277
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,980
only way to know is if you were running

278
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,930
Wireshark and saw these packets going

279
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,810
out from these devices these devices

280
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,390
don't have like antivirus software

281
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:57,350
running on right IO T's just don't so

282
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,000
what are some of the common attack

283
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,610
vectors that you have the the default

284
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,920
passwords is a bad one buffer overflows

285
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,510
that's where you know

286
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,210
the input and this is you know not a

287
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,500
good thing either because that's

288
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,660
typically where they can inject code is

289
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,750
using a buffer overflow and some of

290
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,640
these others unpatched you know I kind

291
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,720
of talked about them patched systems and

292
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,850
phishing attacks as well exploits those

293
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,520
are still occurring so what our cyber

294
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,360
resilient

295
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,820
devices are going to just bring this

296
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,890
thing up a couple of slides to kind of

297
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:35,360
share on average for every hundred lines

298
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:42,740
of source code how skilled or what a

299
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,080
code cook developer you are there's

300
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,210
typically on average one defect the odds

301
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,690
are against us so recognizing that you

302
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,790
can protect your devices and harden them

303
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,400
to the best degree possible do you want

304
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,200
to be able to detect those potential

305
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,250
attacks and then recover from those and

306
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,260
this is kind of going through what are

307
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,300
the steps you go through so protect

308
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,370
detect recover during the initial

309
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,600
startup the first thing that loves

310
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,600
bootloader loves the BIOS right you want

311
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,070
to make sure that that is rooted in

312
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,640
trust otherwise

313
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,589
it attacks the device and you

314
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:18,360
essentially want to own it

315
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,160
there was a canon device where they were

316
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,230
ready to do on the printer and just

317
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,790
started up it means you're doing running

318
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,769
on the control panel that's something

319
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:30,440
that's just been rootkit

320
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,910
you want to secure the defaults and

321
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,360
click data or grass code signing

322
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,589
validation doing boot so that you don't

323
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:39,600
blow a code that hasn't been validated

324
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,790
write a little code that's become from

325
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,399
the manufacturer and then code signing

326
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,260
validation when you're doing update and

327
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,390
you want those updates to be automatic

328
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,860
right so that your customers that's

329
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,909
[Music]

330
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,720
typically it will pop in at night when

331
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,850
it's plugged in but that's what we want

332
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,220
all these IOT devices to do because

333
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,290
there will be four abilities found in

334
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,149
these devices no question about it

335
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:09,510
then you want to monitor these devices

336
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,180
to understand what's going on in them

337
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,930
and then some device monitoring as well

338
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,360
looking for anomaly so one of the things

339
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,470
that we have our HP Labs team found that

340
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,420
when malware attacks remember I said the

341
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,459
typical thing that we'll do is call a

342
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,829
command and control server well guess

343
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:30,570
what what most names should it go after

344
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,000
can't go after an IP address because by

345
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,529
the way those servers could shut down

346
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:36,540
fairly quickly host names get shut down

347
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,120
by

348
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,580
you know other things you know other

349
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,350
other monitoring to monitoring you know

350
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,240
companies that are monitoring here net

351
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,390
will shut those down so what they do is

352
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,330
they have a domain generation algorithm

353
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,100
okay so what since Eric tries all these

354
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,510
host things and you'll have hundreds

355
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,089
opposed to a DNS resolve the message is

356
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:01,790
going out well if that happens the

357
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,070
device can detect that right so we have

358
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,899
betted technology and then printers so

359
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:08,630
that if we see an upsurge of DNS packets

360
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,209
we assume out the device Bennett has

361
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:13,730
been is potentially compromised at that

362
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,260
point you go through a reboot flash

363
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,040
memory and and essentially start up back

364
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,920
up in this new state so we're going to

365
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,270
start seeing some more of these

366
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,740
detection capabilities occurring so good

367
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,750
news and bad news good news is the

368
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,520
manufacturers are starting to do things

369
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,740
but that is as government's getting

370
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,440
involved okay so I've got a couple of

371
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,850
examples of what's going on with the

372
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,790
government because that there did you

373
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,380
know consumers are at rest

374
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,060
Dana's at risk and it costs a lot of

375
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,130
money to recover from these attacks

376
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,970
so there is a miss specification you

377
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,010
know this was a good reading for you it

378
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,200
goes out and tells you what how to build

379
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,959
a device and it actually HP you know

380
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,459
quite a few other companies that

381
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,220
participated in this and it defines what

382
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,350
cyber is delicacy is in there can tell

383
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,540
us it doesn't tell you how it tells you

384
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,400
what you should put into your devices to

385
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,110
protect them and I'm not going to go

386
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,510
through too many details on on this but

387
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,790
there's a whole list that you can go out

388
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,680
you know roots of trust I'm sure you

389
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,790
can't we get the device protecting you

390
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,070
know the

391
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,320
suitable code there's just lots of

392
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,810
things you can do automatic recovery and

393
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,230
things like that you know the UK

394
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,080
government just recently in fact came

395
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,630
out and said ok we want to protect our

396
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,280
consumers we want to protect the

397
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,390
consumers in the United Kingdom so they

398
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,270
basically have identified that poorly

399
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,490
secured io T's increases the security

400
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,320
risks and large scale attacks right they

401
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,730
can use them as botnets

402
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,260
so they right now they're encouraging

403
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,660
manufacturers to secure io T's we signed

404
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,930
on with another company Centrica v we

405
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,730
signed on and said this is important we

406
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,220
are going to do it but here's the here's

407
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,349
the guidelines right no default

408
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,030
passwords we talked about that that's a

409
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,680
big risk you know we have implemented a

410
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,980
disclosure policy so that if someone

411
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,140
finds an issue in their device they can

412
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,650
post that and there's a lot of others

413
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,970
I'm not going to go through all of these

414
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,280
but basically you know it's getting into

415
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,949
just these are basic security hygiene

416
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:28,240
things that you should do when you

417
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,790
develop a device right

418
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,310
be sure to software integrity it's for

419
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,800
personal data that is protected right

420
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,980
that it's encrypted appropriately so

421
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,570
enough to be outdone the state of

422
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,340
California came out of the Senate bills

423
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,360
2700k by 2020 network devices must have

424
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,880
and by the way network devices is so

425
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,650
broad it's not just either T's it's in

426
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,490
the device that's shipped must have

427
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,039
password beneath each device or forced

428
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,440
users to set their password so this is

429
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,450
you know again some of those attacks

430
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,669
that occurred on my ot devices basic

431
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:06,309
things did not have passwords so we are

432
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:07,840
going to start seeing the legislation

433
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,480
coming into play requiring these types

434
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:17,020
of things on my devices now what are the

435
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,820
some of the things that you can do from

436
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,309
a security development best practices so

437
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,350
this is about trying to develop products

438
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,840
from the beginning the security top of

439
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,070
mind Gartner came out ok in 2016 Gartner

440
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,990
came out and predicted that customers

441
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,390
will demand that code is adequately

442
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,770
secured that it's developed with

443
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,169
security best practices and I can tell

444
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:42,520
you in 2018 we we have seen an increase

445
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,230
in customers that are saying I want to

446
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,669
know what I'm a seafood developer best

447
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:49,990
practices because this is this is

448
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,309
serious so this is only going to

449
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:53,980
increase and so it just kind of

450
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,299
highlights when we talk about the

451
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:56,710
security differently development best

452
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,630
practices what are we talking about here

453
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,090
right you you need to ensure all your

454
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,220
all your engineers are trained on this

455
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,200
you want to ensure that you have you

456
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,210
know when you first start a project you

457
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,130
need to identify what is it you're

458
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,080
trying to protect as a customer data is

459
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,390
a you know your own intellectual

460
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,130
property what are you trying to protect

461
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:19,930
in this and then back in 1999

462
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,130
invited to Microsoft and Microsoft have

463
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,570
gone through a whole series of attacks

464
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,970
on their Windows operating system they

465
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,400
have they deployed a hundred engineers

466
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,160
to focus on security okay that wasn't

467
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,200
okay doctor you could say this is a big

468
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,300
problem let's move all over hundred

469
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,490
engineers they came out with some pretty

470
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,620
cool secured the government best

471
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,150
practices you can go to their website

472
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,670
they have the stripe model which is it's

473
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,670
an acronym for you know spoofing

474
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,780
tampering repudiation you know

475
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,670
information disclosure it's actually

476
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,850
really good to use that stripe model

477
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,590
when you're actually developing products

478
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,650
we use that at HP and then using tools

479
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,600
on your code like static code analysis

480
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,280
tools and security secure coding

481
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,770
practices Oh wasp has a great list of

482
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,240
checklist of things to do when you're

483
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,780
developing code right you put all of

484
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,720
that and then the penetration testing is

485
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:32,380
critical as well find out what points

486
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,310
are on that device

487
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,270
and software updates this is making sure

488
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,549
that the firmware is updated on these

489
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:48,100
devices so that because because again

490
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,990
security is not constant

491
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,600
what's secure today will be secured

492
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,850
tomorrow correct and they will find

493
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,600
weaknesses and we must provide an

494
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,820
automatic mechanism in fact this is what

495
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,350
you know the NSA was talking about

496
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,750
what's up old is new again because we

497
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,490
fix this issue in the product but the

498
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,960
customers weren't updating their

499
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,010
products aprender the the other piece of

500
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,850
this is monitoring so s is an IT

501
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,549
organization event company we should

502
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:20,799
know every devices on your network

503
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,720
you should be monitored for instance you

504
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,350
should ensure that those devices can

505
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,450
integrate into any of the security tools

506
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,220
that are out there are simple tools that

507
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,140
are monitoring like Splunk that are

508
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,419
taking the band's front they actually

509
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,640
consume events from these all your

510
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,500
endpoints in your network and can tell

511
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,750
you when your devices are at risk and

512
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,630
then input protection tools like McAfee

513
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,520
and Symantec using those tools to

514
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,740
actually ensure those devices are

515
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,530
secured those

516
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,690
these devices need to be first-class

517
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,290
citizens and

518
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,670
environment because they are actually

519
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,400
not really these environments today and

520
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,120
I'm in summary okay i io t it i know i

521
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,590
went fast but you guys are starting

522
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,140
going tired and stuff so okay I know

523
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,970
it's almost five o'clock on a Saturday

524
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,400
so I really appreciate you guys hanging

525
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,270
in there

526
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,880
IOT devices are an emerging security

527
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,940
threat due to lack of security we saw

528
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,330
many examples of that with some devices

529
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,690
just don't have password set and they

530
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,310
need to be designed with security from

531
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:36,000
the beginning and you know what that's

532
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,240
going to add cost to it so thank you

533
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,530
guys appreciate it

534
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:48,099
[Applause]
