1
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,290
the right thing and are we doing the

2
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,780
things right my name is Tracey Broderick

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,209
and I'm here to talk to you about kind

4
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:19,029
of mine jury my journey here my attempt

5
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:23,230
to get security at Riot Games moving

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,419
from a kind of tool solution driven

7
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:32,168
mindset and to a strategy mindset so you

8
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:33,430
really couldn't about myself I'm a

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,380
senior development manager I've been at

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,320
Riot Games for about sevenish years

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,140
before this I was in television I worked

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,269
at music this is my first gaming company

13
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:45,160
and kind of heavy tech company as well

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,260
when I first started out I was working

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,210
with the network operations group and

16
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,179
it's many form has many names over the

17
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:54,010
years I worked with them but I

18
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,589
eventually found my way into security

19
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,059
I've worked with them quite a bit and I

20
00:00:58,059 --> 00:00:59,800
love the team they didn't really have

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,449
anyone like me a project manager

22
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:03,129
development manager or whatever you want

23
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,809
to call me cuz I had different names and

24
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:06,940
different companies so I found my way to

25
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,750
security I started in the April of 2017

26
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,150
or so and I was actually tasked with

27
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,800
trying to help organize the group as

28
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,190
well as improve our execution we were

29
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,460
working on a lot of things going a lot

30
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,620
of different directions not actually

31
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,780
completing a lot or going over our

32
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,410
deadlines there really was no focus so I

33
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,880
kind of got in there did what I normally

34
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,420
do I just start interviewing everyone

35
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,220
looking at all the rituals trying to

36
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,110
find out what is going on

37
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,870
and I kind of came up with three

38
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,640
essential problems that I wanted to

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,160
focus on one was I noticed there was

40
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,230
little to no connection with the bigger

41
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,200
picture at all so the so a lot of the

42
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,880
team members knew what they were doing

43
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,650
for our project but I was like why are

44
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,500
you actually doing

45
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,240
like what is the creator goal what does

46
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,710
the future look like they kind of answer

47
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,150
those questions and the leaves

48
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,680
themselves couldn't messily answer that

49
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,220
either the next thing was there is

50
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,320
little to no connection between the

51
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,870
teens so they didn't actually see that

52
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,700
there were connected to any of the other

53
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,490
teams I actually experienced the a well

54
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,350
I made this tool aware this other team

55
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,060
using it and I'm like did you ask the

56
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,709
other team do they ask for it well no

57
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,660
did you tell them you're building it

58
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,900
well no and so when I went to that team

59
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,459
and they're like this is cool but we

60
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:30,440
don't need this yet we're barely trying

61
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,060
to like get some of the foundational

62
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,220
pieces off the ground there's just no

63
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,760
point at the time selects on yours

64
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,770
there's little to no prioritization this

65
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,330
is actually kind of a theme with a lot

66
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,350
of the groups I've worked with that

67
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,540
right so when when everything is

68
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,480
important nothing is important and so it

69
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,950
ends up being that there's just too much

70
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,500
there's just too many things going on no

71
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,300
nothing everything takes forever to

72
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,080
actually get done and it really kind of

73
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,060
stressed the team's out and especially

74
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,030
we have we do a survey and it kind of

75
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,410
came in from the survey that there's

76
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,390
just too much work in progress

77
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,700
we weren't focusing they didn't know if

78
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,049
we were focused on the right things we

79
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:10,010
just didn't know what the right things

80
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,610
are so after that I kind of got to see

81
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,900
so I'm trying to figure out what would

82
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,170
be my next steps and luckily I found out

83
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,080
that they're going to be doing a

84
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,000
workshop eight goals workshop and also

85
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,590
kind of looking at the craft of security

86
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,019
and an engineering workshop and so you

87
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,640
put me in touch with the scrum master

88
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,730
for the application security team that

89
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,049
is in Dublin so I transfer out what

90
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,850
we're doing what the current agenda was

91
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,400
and kind of piggyback on that which came

92
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,510
to my first experiment which is yeah the

93
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,760
goals workshop thinking outside the box

94
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,459
are just thinking big so I essentially

95
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:52,370
hijacked half of that session in general

96
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,120
and I wanted the seaso

97
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,970
actually bring what his goals were for

98
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,650
the grapes because of right now in the

99
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,000
session they had over everyone who's

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,349
just gonna bring stuff talk about

101
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:04,060
strength stop come out weaknesses and

102
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,720
that was it

103
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,790
so I wanted him to bring what he wanted

104
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,060
to focus on so we got in the room that

105
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,430
day I kind of wish I had talked to him a

106
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,620
little bit before then so he put up a

107
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,000
bunch of things there was nothing four

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,760
or five and it was there are some

109
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,579
solutions there are some problems there

110
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,620
was some I'm not quite sure but it

111
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,000
doesn't matter it was a great start

112
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,320
we're trying to get moving

113
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,130
so I really wanted the guys to work

114
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,570
through that because like one of them

115
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,260
was just patching what does that mean

116
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,370
what is that supposed to look like how

117
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,500
do we know we're done how do we know

118
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,449
that we've been successful and so the

119
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:42,370
guys start kind of working through I had

120
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,710
them kind of pair up with each other if

121
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,940
maybe they hadn't like worked with the

122
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,289
group very much so like I put the sack

123
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:50,830
up sleeves with I think it's AB SEC and

124
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,630
so on and they got through they're

125
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,590
looking at like best in class and most

126
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,810
efficient and it was it was an

127
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,990
interesting exercise but ultimately the

128
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,810
outcome was that it wasn't actually very

129
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,539
useful good thought exercises but that

130
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:09,400
was really about it I really want to

131
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,560
make sure that when I do any types of

132
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,599
facilitation any type of workshops it's

133
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,160
a day long I want something to actually

134
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,500
come out of it and well I got kind of

135
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,110
people talking nothing really happened

136
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,210
that was kind of it so I was like okay

137
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,550
so this isn't quite working so what

138
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,320
would what should be the next day what

139
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,949
makes sense so it's time to see so and

140
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:31,330
actually talking about this grandmaster

141
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,970
day application security team I kind of

142
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,020
took me to experiment number two which

143
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,180
was looking at a monthly product review

144
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,710
so I wanted each of the leads to

145
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,620
actually get together and present what

146
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,780
their team is doing because they need to

147
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,880
they need to see because a common a

148
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,830
common theme was that none of my work

149
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,900
actually touches anyone else's team

150
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,030
we're not doing the same things so but

151
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,210
they needed to see that because I

152
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,680
talking to teams there was a lot of

153
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,240
connection sometimes they're actually

154
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,770
working on the exact same thing and

155
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,280
didn't even know it so I wanted to keep

156
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,900
his little overhead as possible

157
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,090
God notice they were already kind of

158
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,069
cautious and hesitant to do this anyways

159
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:13,500
so what I did is I just gave them kind

160
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,090
of very simple model tell us what you

161
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,160
completed the last month what you plan

162
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,949
to do what your goals are risks

163
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:21,509
what is your roadmap and what is your

164
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:23,639
metrics let's just get it out there get

165
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,870
it viewed differently

166
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,880
besides one-on-one conversations which

167
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,710
they were having and start kind of

168
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:33,570
asking those questions so ultimately the

169
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,860
collaboration started I noticed

170
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,110
questions I noticed a lot of discussions

171
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,690
happening after this it actually was

172
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,910
send up being really good for the team's

173
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,440
themselves because they were super

174
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,479
interested in what was going on but

175
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,360
again it was kind of myth that the leads

176
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,400
themselves like what is the real length

177
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,409
value to me and so I was like okay this

178
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:56,039
still works

179
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:58,560
we need to continue doing it but like

180
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,789
what is the next thing how can we

181
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:02,250
actually kind of ramp this up and make

182
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,490
them care a little more about why this

183
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,039
is important so this broad experiment 3

184
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:12,840
which was the quarterly stakeholder

185
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,729
review we've never actually presented to

186
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:16,770
our stakeholders there is very limited

187
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,740
anything so and the promised time

188
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,020
apparently the CSO is saying that the

189
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,370
stakeholders were starting to wonder

190
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,800
what it is that we were doing so I was

191
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,199
like okay let's actually have all of the

192
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,440
leads present to our stakeholders it's

193
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,030
same thing what they present to each

194
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:33,509
other

195
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:36,840
same decks took about two hours one of

196
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,840
them to get through stakeholders had

197
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,780
some questions but yeah so in a lot of

198
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,099
it some of our stakeholders aren't that

199
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:45,780
technical so it actually had to kind of

200
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,960
force them to speak more it just not

201
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,840
little terms so that happened and it was

202
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,580
good the stakeholders who like you guys

203
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,370
are clearly doing important things you

204
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,190
know like we like where this is going

205
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,479
but we actually don't know where this is

206
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,970
going so we don't know why it's

207
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,470
important we just believe that it's

208
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,930
important and so they actually came to

209
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,229
us and what's asking what interaction

210
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:17,370
strategy what are your goals how does

211
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,800
what the work you're doing that seems

212
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,900
important affects the entire company

213
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,550
what does that look like what do you

214
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,210
what are you giving us so luckily this

215
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,729
made me incredibly happy because it was

216
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:31,680
finally going towards what I actually

217
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,110
wanted where I needed them to go start

218
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,669
seeing that and it was also nice because

219
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,708
I wasn't pushing it I wasn't getting

220
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,770
dirty lips and annoyed responses in

221
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,990
frustration so it wasn't me finally

222
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,209
pushing this it was them and so we got

223
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:49,709
to that point so now we're I don't know

224
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,589
how many months ended this way so it's

225
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:53,279
the big ask

226
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,459
it's the strategy presentation or how it

227
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,230
got leaders to present not what security

228
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,120
can do for security but what security

229
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,360
can do for the company so because we

230
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,920
have half the team is in LA half the

231
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,750
team is Dublin we had a lot of early

232
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,970
mornings we had actually some late

233
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,400
nights I'm sure there was a lot of

234
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:11,820
alcohol

235
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,500
somewhere mixed in putting this all

236
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,110
together but we focus on the first thing

237
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,880
which was our vision if we couldn't even

238
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,910
figure out what our vision was we could

239
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,830
even go beyond like this whole thing

240
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,800
would have to get blown up so luckily

241
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,360
our seeso had put together a vision kind

242
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,190
of a while back so we kind of directs

243
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:32,680
that

244
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,619
that out trying to see what it was it

245
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:37,569
wasn't great it wasn't necessarily

246
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:39,430
inspiring but it worked

247
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,860
everyone was like it works it gives us

248
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,959
enough of what we need we can move

249
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,399
forward it doesn't matter

250
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:47,439
let's do this and actually this is

251
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:49,300
something similar it's build a solid

252
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,100
security foundation to protect random

253
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,100
players so the agreement with the Leeds

254
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,589
fine we don't need to mess with this

255
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:59,019
whatever let's move on we have we have

256
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:00,610
more important things to work on

257
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,749
so next came the strategic goals some of

258
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:05,980
these are actually my definitions

259
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,480
there's different there's different

260
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,339
terms for all these different yeah

261
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:10,629
terminology kind of different

262
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:12,189
definitions but for mance the

263
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:14,559
opportunities a problem space that need

264
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:17,670
to be tackled to achieve that vision so

265
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,689
again the seesaw had kind of done a

266
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:21,730
little bit of work but he brought just

267
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,100
words words that were very ambiguous

268
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,350
they were very broad anyone can define

269
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,089
them in any way such as such Gigi cold

270
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:32,920
detection response makes sense that's

271
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,839
something that you need the next one if

272
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:37,749
we network again something that's

273
00:10:37,749 --> 00:10:39,429
important and then the constant access

274
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:44,649
another thing so this we kind of these

275
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:46,449
are good but yeah we needed some

276
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:48,699
clarification that we needed some more

277
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:51,429
definition so what I did is I pulled up

278
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:54,220
a tool that gets used with a lot of kind

279
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,749
of company visioning and strategy

280
00:10:55,749 --> 00:10:57,999
it's called vivid descriptors vivid

281
00:10:57,999 --> 00:10:59,620
descriptors essentially just paint a

282
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,420
picture of what the world should look

283
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,699
like if we have been successful if we

284
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:06,399
get if we achieve what we need to be a

285
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,649
lot of times is used for a vision but I

286
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:10,300
thought this would be worthwhile enough

287
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,329
to use for strategic goals so in an

288
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:16,329
example a bit of descriptors from stony

289
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:19,480
this is actually circa 1950s so their

290
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,380
vision was become the company that most

291
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,150
as the worldwide image of Japanese

292
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,210
products as being in poor quality so

293
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,760
some of the descriptors will we will be

294
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,830
the first Japanese company to go into

295
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,510
the American market and distribute

296
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,820
directly we won't succeed with

297
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,310
innovations like the transistor radio

298
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,840
that American companies have failed at

299
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,910
and so on it paints a very good picture

300
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,950
it actually kind of sets some my kind of

301
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,410
goals for where we need to go to it

302
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,660
explains what that actually means for

303
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,110
that so we did something similar for

304
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,060
each of each of the five and here's five

305
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,470
goals at the time so you got a room

306
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,720
there's probably about three four or

307
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,300
five sentences for each we kind of

308
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,860
started joking that like they're like

309
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,690
not so vivid descriptors but they're

310
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,490
kind of good enough at this point I

311
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,320
didn't need to be perfect they didn't

312
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,450
need it to be perfect just enough to get

313
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,100
them going just enough to keep them

314
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,980
moving forward so just for detection

315
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,660
response I'm just gonna throw out there

316
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,540
one of the descriptors was we will be

317
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,460
aware or we are aware of attackers and

318
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,290
cheers and their tactics before they hit

319
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,330
our environment any players yeah that's

320
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,490
kind of basic but there's key elements

321
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,380
in there like it's about not just

322
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,940
attackers and cheaters but also their

323
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,150
tactics and before is the key word so it

324
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,400
helps them a drive what detection

325
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,960
response where we should actually be

326
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,040
going another one might be we are

327
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,930
continually testing your defense and

328
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,300
detection capabilities again just adds

329
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,790
some extra clarity it's we can always be

330
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,740
working on these but it's just it good

331
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,250
enough it's what we needed so the next

332
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,840
two thing is we lift at once we had our

333
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,520
goals they were a bit more defined

334
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,290
we understood more what they should what

335
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,940
we should be going towards what the like

336
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,190
nor start each of those are we're

337
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,530
looking the tactics and obviously we've

338
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,470
have tactics galore so much working

339
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,980
progress

340
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,800
so much has been completed so they were

341
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,390
like this is going to be easy and the

342
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,520
task was to basically align all of the

343
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,340
work they've been doing to these goals

344
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,530
what makes sense and so it became an

345
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,590
interesting razor is if this doesn't

346
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:28,080
align with one of our goals why are we

347
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,880
doing it what's the point

348
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,840
and if we

349
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,380
think it is important then is our goals

350
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,670
there's something wrong with one of our

351
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,640
goals or are we missing one so it does

352
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,140
feed back it's just not completely

353
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,120
top-down they do press feedback into

354
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,690
each other

355
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,880
but it helps create a leg these are the

356
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,380
projects we need to like just step aside

357
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,780
and not necessarily immediately shut

358
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,700
them down but get to the point when we

359
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,430
can we can put them aside ice box them

360
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,140
so we can focus on our goals because

361
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,340
it's what's important and what we

362
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,150
obtained important and then just to jump

363
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,710
in with that the next thing would be of

364
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,260
the work that we decided is important

365
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,650
what is the actual impact what is that

366
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,950
change that we should see if that tactic

367
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,630
that work has been completed

368
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,640
successfully that is kind of a huge

369
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,590
piece so make sure that what we are

370
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,220
doing we were doing it right because

371
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,720
there's a lot of different ways you can

372
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,000
tackle a goal but you need some type of

373
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,130
definition some type of like success

374
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,570
criteria to make sure you're going in

375
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,750
the right direction

376
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,030
so one of those things if we just took

377
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,890
the you were continually testing our

378
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,530
defense detection capabilities you can

379
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,290
say the tactic one of the tactics was

380
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,140
implement attack simulation again very

381
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,140
basic it's something we are working on

382
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,690
actually but the impact of that is if

383
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,030
this is done we now have a repeatable

384
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,910
attack scenarios for unit testing skill

385
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,460
drills and attack campaigns so we

386
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,960
basically did that for all of that so we

387
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,270
have our veteran we had our five goals

388
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,190
we had the descriptions what that meant

389
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,320
we had all of our work on lines which

390
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,380
goals we had already kind of started

391
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,940
taking a pause and the work that didn't

392
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,590
align and then we it's like what is that

393
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,050
impact what are we going to say that the

394
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,300
company now has or what is it them the

395
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:22,930
difference if we complete these so that

396
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,000
was essentially our agenda like

397
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,920
jennipher the presentation the vision

398
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,560
the goals the tactics to impact I'm

399
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,480
trying to remember I think there was

400
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,280
only under being one person that

401
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,250
presented to our stakeholders but again

402
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,930
everyone was in the room got all our

403
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,420
stakeholders back in the room and we

404
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,010
went through and we actually talked

405
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,710
about what we completed in 2017 and how

406
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,210
it aligned to our goals and what the

407
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,030
impact was and then we looked at what we

408
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,910
were doing in 2018 again what the work

409
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,250
was what is the impact and was actually

410
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,810
hip asking them to hold us accountable

411
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,300
that if we don't complete these things

412
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,630
we have failed and why we have failed

413
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,070
and then explain how we have failed

414
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,020
because sometimes it's okay sometimes

415
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,410
that's actually necessary so though I

416
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,600
would say the presentation went over

417
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,100
really well we gave them what they

418
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,560
wanted they understood more about what

419
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,870
week what value security could provide

420
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,960
the company it was they were super

421
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,570
excited and I would say they actually

422
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,920
the one nice thing is they now knew how

423
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,870
they could help us they became advocates

424
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,660
for us they they could go out to teams

425
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,920
they could already start making the

426
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,930
connections and going oh this is the

427
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,360
stuff you're doing you know my product

428
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,770
is working on this you should talk to it

429
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,100
you know

430
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,050
you know list names so you can start

431
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,960
they were asking us how can we help you

432
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,630
because now I understand we understand

433
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,330
more and the other benefit was we

434
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,230
presented this and in all hands with

435
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,570
yeah I'm all hands for security and so

436
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,930
all of the engineers now on the team as

437
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,940
well as myself who's new security

438
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,400
understand more so what it was though

439
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,959
we're trying to get to they could see

440
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,300
how their work was important they could

441
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,040
see the value of the work that it was a

442
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,930
bigger picture they just weren't just

443
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,990
doing stuff to do stuff which was become

444
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,359
very frustrating so

445
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:21,480
we're at right now with this because

446
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,669
that was in the last year or so it's

447
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:27,929
we're actually looking at all of these

448
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:29,580
thing we just did we're looking at our

449
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,659
vision when we're looking at our

450
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:33,120
strategies we want to we want to

451
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,190
redefine what we think we need to we

452
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,850
want to make them stronger we want to

453
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,740
reassess where we really want to go it's

454
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,720
just constantly making that better

455
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,960
making it more clear and the other thing

456
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,789
about this kind of like thought process

457
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:50,490
is it's not just at a top level we can

458
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,919
definitely look at it at team level

459
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,379
what's the purpose of the team why does

460
00:17:55,379 --> 00:17:57,929
it exist where is their scope what

461
00:17:57,929 --> 00:17:59,669
should they be doing who is their

462
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:01,320
audience why are they doing this and

463
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,659
then from there figure out what makes

464
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:05,460
sense and then it also works at a

465
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,230
project level what is the purpose of the

466
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,669
project why

467
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:11,009
if this projects been done what what

468
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:12,750
should we be seeing what should be the

469
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,519
change in the world why is it so

470
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:16,440
important all of those things I mean you

471
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,330
can probably do it a task level even if

472
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,649
you wanted to that might be a little

473
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:21,870
much but you can't but you have to know

474
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,679
why one of the things that's super

475
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,799
important for me is making sure that all

476
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,500
of my engineers know what what are they

477
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,259
doing why are they doing it why are they

478
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:37,080
doing the right things and are we doing

479
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,419
the things right because for me if they

480
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:43,769
don't understand why they aren't doing

481
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:45,029
what they're doing and what they're

482
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:46,679
doing that I don't want them doing it at

483
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:47,100
all

484
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,919
like I have to tell them to stop working

485
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,090
because I don't want them wasting their

486
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,639
time I don't want to feel like they are

487
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:55,019
not doing something important they're

488
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:55,810
not doing something

489
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,370
valuable because nothing's more

490
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,510
frustrating than having to basically

491
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:06,340
throw out your work done early but thank

492
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,040
you thank you for your time

493
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,510
I hope you enjoy the rest of the

494
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,430
conference and if you have any questions

495
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,380
