6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,210
incident response and the threat

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,940
intelligence and I'm gonna talk to you a

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,860
little bit today about human centric

9
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,880
threat hunting so what that means and a

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,060
little bit about how to do it a couple

11

gonna happen this talk originated from

23
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:00,710
more of a discussion type panel with the

24
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,040
iti sack so I tailored that a little bit

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,469
it is mostly geared towards large

26
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:08,600
enterprises that have intellectual

27
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,630
property to protect how many of you out

28
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,759
there are working in an enterprise

29
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:17,840
information security show hands okay how

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,549
many of you are consulting to enterprise

31
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:24,079
is that okay okay good good students can

32
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,020
you see show hands of students a couple

33
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,719
okay right on we're excited that you're

34
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:32,270
getting into that career field if the

35
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,420
recent security it takes a special kind

36
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,869
of person right let me tell you a little

37
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:43,039
about myself so I come from a military

38
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:46,939
background I started off doing signals

39
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:50,659
intelligence so analysis of the way

40
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:52,240
people will communicate with each other

41
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,740
from there I got into the cyber realm

42
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,150
and then

43
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,280
I don't know this is a good thing or a

44
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,670
bad thing but the army said hey you have

45
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,950
a personality maybe an excess of

46
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,270
personality we can do something with

47
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,590
that so then I got on the human-sized

48
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,210
I've really done full-spectrum

49
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,490
operations for intelligence collection

50
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,540
and analysis I got injured so the army

51
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,610
said rust you're getting kind of old

52
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,400
time - time to go

53
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,400
and so they separated me for medical

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,980
reasons I got into the contracting world

55
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,160
and then ended up at micron and I've

56
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,900
been there for about a year one of the

57
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,220
best companies that you could ever work

58
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,050
for and I'm not just saying that because

59
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,240
my boss is in the audience right it

60
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,790
really is a great company so I'm gonna

61
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,200
try and hook to you guys in the story

62
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,950
and then it's a story with a principle

63
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,380
so it's not just a funny anecdote so I

64
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,900
want you to pay attention to this and

65
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,430
see if maybe you'd experience the same

66
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,250
thing so I'm working for this guy we'll

67
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,940
call him John and he and I are off doing

68
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,000
our thing and we're sitting in a car and

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,310
we're driving around and he said pee out

70
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,209
of the blue it's like hey did I ever

71
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:06,770
tell you about this guy I worked with

72
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,380
Dave least maybe these aren't their real

73
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,980
names obviously right so I said I don't

74
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,520
think so

75
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,870
now John he's he was in the Army -

76
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,480
served in the Ranger Regiment regiments

77
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,870
one of them and Rangers are a little

78
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,700
different they're even more different

79
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,250
than like Regular Army soldiers are kind

80
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,300
of different - so I said no I never

81
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,090
heard of this guy Dave so he says ok so

82
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,860
check this out and this is how all the

83
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,709
army story started right is hey check

84
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:41,780
this out and if they're really really

85
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,820
good that they start with if I haven't

86
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,160
seen it I wouldn't have believed right

87
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,000
you

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,020
with some profanity in there so he says

89
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,250
okay check this out this is John talking

90
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,100
right I'm working on duty right now I'm

91
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,870
sitting at the desk and you always have

92
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,030
to have a soldier on duty and he's like

93
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,500
I said to the desk and incomes of

94
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,350
Lieutenant and he is just worked up he's

95
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,340
upset and he says to me you know what's

96
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,680
going on my soldiers are getting hit

97
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,608
with grapefruits and so I look at it and

98
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,089
I'm like I have no idea and let me let

99
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:22,280
me check it out sir you know go take

100
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,000
five so let's hit it goes away John gets

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,220
up and he heads upstairs he's in the

102
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,660
barracks Rex was wearing these soldiers

103
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,120
stay and he heads upstairs to the

104
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,590
barracks and he starts to notice junior

105
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,480
soldiers so privates right and we're

106
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,850
taught when we were made leaders to keep

107
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,550
privates busy because if you don't they

108
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,010
all get into trouble right and I know

109
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,770
you see parallels to users so don't

110
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,620
pretend like you don't so he sees these

111
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,140
practicing he's like what's going on and

112
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,050
he gets upstairs onto the third floor

113
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,020
and he sees his buddy Dave poke his head

114
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,570
out with the door and they quickly get

115
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,680
back there so he's like okay what's

116
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,510
going on so he gets down to the end of

117
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,340
the hall and he goes into the room and

118
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,020
he sees Dave in there he's like he sees

119
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,240
a couple other privates he says Dave

120
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,419
dude what's going on and Dave's like I

121
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:16,190
don't know what you're saying nothing

122
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,650
and just then a radio crackles right and

123
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,970
there's a voice on this radio and says

124
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,130
hey man what's going on

125
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,660
we're a just in the next one so my

126
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,110
friend Tom's like damn what is going on

127
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,180
and he's like so Dave finally gives in

128
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,919
he says check this out he's the coolest

129
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,580
thing ever and so they've got one of

130
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,340
these slingshots right and these two

131
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,380
privates are standing next to a window

132
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,660
that they've taken the screen out of and

133
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,800
they've got a boxing

134
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,750
fruits and they're taking these

135
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,220
grapefruits and they're putting them in

136
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,590
the slingshot and they're they're

137
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,940
pulling this thing back and they're just

138
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,849
letting go now at the same time that

139
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:01,129
this engineering company is forming up

140
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:03,680
in a field adjacent to this barracks

141
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,479
right and so remember when I told you

142
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,250
that Regas are a little different right

143
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,979
they've gone full tilt on this so

144
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:14,360
they've got a guy on the roof with

145
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,159
binoculars the communicating with the

146
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:18,860
radio and he's telling him where the

147
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,030
grapefruits are landing so they could

148
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,259
have just aim to hit soldiers right so

149
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,360
my friend John's he seems like I can't

150
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,710
believe this is really happening

151
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,180
it goes over the window he looks out the

152
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,280
window and sure enough there are these

153
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,930
engineers and they've got guys on the

154
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,889
ground that have been hit by his

155
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:37,219
grapefruits and so he's like you guys

156
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:38,810
get this crap out of here and he's

157
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,690
trying to trying to control her so I'm

158
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,909
laughing I'm controlling because of

159
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,800
course this would happen right you

160
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,009
couldn't like to make it up and and he

161
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,020
looks at me anything's like do you know

162
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,069
what Russ I would have never imagined

163
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:56,349
that something like this could happen

164
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,750
but if I had it would have been Dave

165
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,569
that would think of it and do it right

166
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:05,659
now think to yourself how many times

167
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:09,440
have I seen something happened right and

168
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,050
when I see who the user was that did it

169
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,659
I go I never would have thought this

170
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:17,599
could happen but if it was it would have

171
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,639
been him right he would have thought of

172
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,330
this now I tell you the story because I

173
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,669
want to illustrate a point the point is

174
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:29,419
this every every one of you has this

175
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:31,219
ability to kind of size people on right

176
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:33,349
everyone else does and we tend to meet

177
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:35,060
people number like okay

178
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,410
that's kind of who this person is and we

179
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,550
get to know a little bit more like kids

180
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,340
whose person is and maybe keep an eye on

181
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,960
them because they might do something

182
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,650
crazy or whatever but we don't know how

183
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,300
to articulate that very well so it's

184
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,680
really what the point is today is to

185
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,380
help you sort of articulate what those

186
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,730
things are help you kind of narrow down

187
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,450
those really high-risk users right but

188
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,340
you want to keep an eye on so this

189
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,550
remember grapefruits slingshots soldiers

190
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:10,040
down if had to be addicted right so most

191
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,750
of the time has thread cultures we tend

192
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,820
to focus on ones and zeros right we look

193
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,930
at systems we look at machines for

194
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,740
problems and we look at them for

195
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,360
solutions right so we're looking for the

196
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,700
latest and greatest tool an algorithm

197
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,630
whatever to try and solve our problem of

198
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,810
insider threats and the thing is that

199
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,850
behind every one of those threats is a

200
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,860
you know a Dennis Nedry from Jurassic

201
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,080
Park and if you don't know that

202
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,159
reference you're at a very young or I'm

203
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,700
very old

204
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:48,260
so so if we take that approach we say

205
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,730
okay it's a human that's interface to

206
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,160
you with the system it's a human that's

207
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,410
setting up a system or configuring a

208
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,860
system let me just sort of think about

209
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,330
humans more in terms of risk rather than

210
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,400
systems right and I just want you to

211
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,480
kind of start making that shift we're

212
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,050
going to talk today about Pam now when

213
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,040
we're talking about humans

214
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,380
that's a three-hour discussion I was

215
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,600
told a couple things by my friends on

216
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,990
the B side staff and that was you've got

217
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,210
a much shorter amount of time and be

218
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:24,410
entertaining right and keep things

219
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,760
concise so we're only going to focus on

220
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,860
this one little piece if you want to

221
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,060
talk more about some of those other

222
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,460
pieces I'm happy to point you in the

223
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,510
right direction but we're going to talk

224
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,450
today about Pam and no none of those

225
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,840
Pam's this is an acronym because that's

226
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,250
what we love in the military we love

227
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,320
acronyms and so about policeman access

228
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,420
to motivation right thanks

229
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,830
so when we are looking at users

230
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,830
individuals as a potential risk we want

231
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,770
to evaluate these three things in order

232
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,380
to effectively gauge what the risk is of

233
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,090
that person right

234
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,470
whether that is just a careless user or

235
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,230
an admin or if it's actually someone

236
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,510
trying to conduct industrial espionage

237
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,910
or try to steal stuff or if it's someone

238
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,620
who's potentially going to sabotage the

239
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,580
system so when we talk about placements

240
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,490
we're talking about where people sit in

241
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:28,770
an organizational hierarchy right so do

242
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,260
they have the ability to make changes or

243
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,180
to influence things because of their

244
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,190
position right so that's something we're

245
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,400
gonna have to take into account and then

246
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,440
or do they have influence that they can

247
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,000
wield because of that placement that's

248
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,040
kind of what we're looking at as far as

249
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,610
access goes this is kind of your typical

250
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,710
your sis admins right they may not be

251
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,750
very high up in the organizational chart

252
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,089
but they have a lot of access and they

253
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:02,339
could do a lot on a on a network or on a

254
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:05,430
system and so that's something that we

255
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,900
have to take into account if we start

256
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,870
evaluating them as a risk

257
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:15,230
the third thing and probably the most

258
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,999
interesting is the motivation of the

259
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:20,959
individual you know we're kind of

260
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,839
looking at all of the standard so in the

261
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,189
military right you get these briefs all

262
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:28,790
the time about how to tap spot someone

263
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,730
who's you know an espionage agent right

264
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,730
or who's been compromised and flipped

265
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,259
and is giving information to the enemy

266
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:37,999
right then they talk a lot about these

267
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:42,100
things right are they simply a fluid

268
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,980
are they spouting off you know about

269
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,569
their ideology all the time very vocal

270
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:54,220
about it you know do they have

271
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,839
girlfriends all over the place right or

272
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:58,809
boyfriends or whatever that looks like

273
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:02,660
and so those are the typical motivating

274
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,889
factors that cause people to commit

275
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,019
espionage right and it's those same

276
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:07,910
motivating factors that can cause them

277
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,600
to become a threat on the inside right

278
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,579
instead it's the same thing across the

279
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:15,139
board even though they might be very

280
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:18,529
different activities right so someone

281
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:23,209
who let's say with with steal secrets

282
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,910
and sell them to a foreign country while

283
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,490
serving they need a clear capacity for

284
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,350
the United States government or any

285
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,929
government for that matter something's

286
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:34,279
going to trigger them in their life

287
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,170
that's going to cause them to be

288
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,939
sufficiently motivated to take that risk

289
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:41,269
and to conduct that type of behavior

290
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:45,350
activity conversely what is the trigger

291
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,129
for someone inside of our networks that

292
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:52,579
would cause them to be willing to commit

293
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:54,499
an act of sabotage right to take down a

294
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:57,019
network work or to put in malicious code

295
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:00,160
or to enable some piece of malware

296
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,970
there's going to be something that

297
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,069
happens and so if we have a good

298
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:07,459
baseline of you know who these people

299
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:09,170
are and

300
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,490
you know for the ones that are the

301
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,339
higher risk what makes them tick then

302
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:15,620
that's going to enable us then to more

303
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,740
effectively prepare for a triggering

304
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,230
event right and when that event happens

305
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,269
when they get triggered we can then

306
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,950
respond in a way that's appropriate in

307
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,980
order to either protect our local

308
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,440
property or to protect our systems or to

309
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,899
protect people okay

310
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,449
just making sense can they get a

311
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:38,240
north-south or a rest you're way off

312
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,410
base okay right on thank you so finally

313
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,970
once we've identified these people we

314
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,889
have to decide what to do next right and

315
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:52,010
this is going to be dependent on you

316
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:56,560
your organization your your teams

317
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,000
whatever the appetite is or what you

318
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,190
decide that you want to do next and that

319
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,709
could be anything from simple monitoring

320
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:07,160
- you know gathering evidence to turn

321
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,079
over to law enforcement that's a

322
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,389
decision that you'll have to make with

323
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:15,529
your respective leadership and in your

324
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:17,000
organization's and I you know there

325
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,449
isn't a one right answer for that it's

326
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:22,250
what is right for that situation or what

327
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,680
is right for that individual and it's

328
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,180
really important that you but you gotta

329
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,050
have to start thinking about these

330
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,850
things at the time that you begin the

331
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,800
assessments right know one of the steps

332
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,449
that we're going to take in order to

333
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:34,850
prepare for these eventualities this

334
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:39,019
make sense okay wow I really blazed

335
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:41,810
through that one okay that's it in a

336
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:42,199
nutshell

337
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:45,290
Pam place um an access motivation take a

338
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,790
look what you're really looking for is

339
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,740
that sweet spot right where all three of

340
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,120
those things converge there'll be a

341
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,470
berry if you look at like a Venn diagram

342
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,230
there'll be a very small interchange and

343
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,730
that's the people that you want to keep

344
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,240
the eye on the most okay so we've got

345
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,130
about 15 minutes let's open up for

346
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:01,670
questions

347
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,060
I love discussion and telling stories so

348
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,388
fire away

349
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,750
yes sir

350
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,530
so social engineering so the question is

351
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,880
could we use similar techniques to

352
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,610
identify individuals who are at risk to

353
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,980
be susceptible to social engineering or

354
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,600
sort of external phishing type attacks

355
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,810
and the answer is absolutely for social

356
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,340
engineering right because what really is

357
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,040
social engineering that's what spies do

358
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,390
to convince people to spy right and so

359
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,110
when we start talking about from

360
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,030
criminality perspective that's really

361
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,670
people taking those same skills but

362
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,460
applying them for a different outcome

363
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,340
right so yes you could do that that

364
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,070
might even lead to a discussion on you

365
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,860
know maybe we produce as an organization

366
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,530
we produce some trainings help bolster

367
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,840
up with defenses maybe right so

368
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,600
something along those lines or we can

369
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,370
maybe put a closer watch on those

370
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,330
individuals because they are susceptible

371
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,440
you got to understand that terminals are

372
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,350
thinking all the time about people right

373
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,020
systems might be vulnerable but really

374
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,030
they're looking at what's my game what

375
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,370
do I get out of this right and so if I

376
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,930
can compromise a person and that person

377
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,210
can get me on to that network faster to

378
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,510
get the data that I want packing these

379
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,820
resistance right

380
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,500
or I should think so yes great question

381
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,710
yes sir

382
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,430
okay so the question is I'm very sick so

383
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,110
I make sure I got bike so the question

384
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:08,380
is how much of that do we get from

385
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,660
that's the question so question is how

386
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,230
much of this is from learn activity

387
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,119
breaks of pattern analysis and then we

388
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,329
figure it out versus hiring someone to

389
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:28,550
come and you actually has better is that

390
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:32,570
right that's a great question and the

391
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,960
answer is 50/50

392
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,370
there are a lot of people who have

393
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,960
talked about this kind of stuff maybe

394
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,500
not applying it to the cyber domain

395
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,790
mostly looking at it in terms of like a

396
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,000
physical security issue however the

397
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,960
principles are the same

398
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,970
really okay so all I'm doing here is

399
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,390
extracting these principles that human

400
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,190
handlers would you this is been saying

401
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,230
how can we then take the same principles

402
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,240
and apply them over here in the cyber

403
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,240
domain right so do they carry over I

404
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,850
think we could all agree if I can see

405
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,760
some nods right that they do because

406
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,310
users are kind of their people too and

407
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,620
they make the same decisions those same

408
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,760
motivations it will really help if you

409
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,110
bring in people who have done it before

410
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:24,710
you could say you know well okay how we

411
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,440
do a good example from my life right

412
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,110
where

413
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,190
[Music]

414
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,940
we wanted to use to obtain some very

415
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,290
specific type of data we come up online

416
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,480
and every picture we saw all the staff

417
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,090
kept stepping out to the front and he

418
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,380
would always be in front of everyone

419
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,030
I can even a big huge groups he would do

420
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,410
something to draw search through self

421
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,870
Mexico here so if I were to a person's

422
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,570
person my approach might be you're

423
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,940
obviously an expert in your field can

424
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,360
you help us figure this out because

425
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,570
you're an expert we've recognized sort

426
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,210
of the superiority of your intellect you

427
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,920
know those kinds of thinking and laughs

428
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,300
but it works all the time so I would say

429
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,000
if you can find someone if you're into

430
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,700
enterprising looking to start carving

431
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,910
your users and would probably believe

432
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,450
you to find someone that's done that

433
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:30,520
testing maybe this question that's a

434
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,850
good one

435
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,570
yeah so that very large chip

436
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:42,550
manufacturer the you mentioned

437
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,380
maybe some of these processes

438
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,470
probably not in this video

439
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,580
it was on the news that's the only

440
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,740
reason I am right right now that's it

441
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,160
was in the news but those those are

442
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:20,330
ongoing cases that I'm always going to

443
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,720
kind of come back to your users

444
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,190
regardless of what the problem are is

445
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,010
people are going to be at the center of

446
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,560
those kinds of issues right because

447
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,090
people will also make decisions people

448
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,370
are the ones that click on a link from

449
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,060
fish right people are the ones that will

450
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,560
sit down in the bar and start

451
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,030
complaining about work so when they

452
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,130
don't even know or the my favorites on a

453
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,910
plane right they sit down on a plane and

454
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,490
you asked a seemingly benign question

455
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,900
and they will tell you their whole life

456
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,140
story all about their work everyone they

457
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,850
have an issue with how those bad

458
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,040
decisions are screwing everything up

459
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,920
they'll do it all you know just listen

460
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:12,830
it's really like so yeah and that's why

461
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,510
I tend to look at it from that

462
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,510
perspective right is people will go

463
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:23,030
there and left almost every time unless

464
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:27,040
they've been trained right

465
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,860
okay good question I appreciate it next

466
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,200
question you guys talking it over here

467
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,440
yeah shoot

468
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,660
I was probably not something when you're

469
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,320
talking about this form especially not

470
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:57,350
with my boss right there we are

471
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:05,670
so that might probably take the

472
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,230
intellectual property and the security

473
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,960
of that mr. Popkin very seriously and we

474
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,100
take steps to safeguard it and you've

475
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,390
been very fortunate to have a lot of

476
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,220
support from very senior leadership

477
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,250
there that are very cognizant and aware

478
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:29,120
of the risk that suppose so you know

479
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,800
we're always looking for the very best

480
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,020
talents we're always looking for the

481
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,920
very best solutions technical solutions

482
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,160
and we're always open to new ideas so

483
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:46,620
you know that's really you know I just

484
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,429
answered question

485
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,560
so as far as specific tools Solutions

486
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,470
Manning I'm not going to comment on any

487
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,220
of those types of things like I said

488
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,050
we're always open to new ideas and to

489
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,550
we're always looking for the very best

490
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,150
time maybe put it in a more generic

491
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:32,450
sense how much of being aware of have to

492
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,600
take the culture into account right

493
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,730
because I mean we're very here's a

494
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,470
better way to look at it so academia

495
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,200
versus industry right academia is really

496
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,810
built on the free exchange of flow of

497
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:52,790
information right sort of you know the

498
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,440
environment are going to expect a lot

499
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,650
more freedom and ability to interchange

500
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,380
with their peers the types of things are

501
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,020
working on we're as an industry where

502
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,850
they're looking at specific

503
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,490
manufacturing specific processes and

504
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,050
techniques and materials that you would

505
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,550
use to build a product

506
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,180
well that's very much the secret sauce

507
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,050
as it were right or the recipe for code

508
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,640
their whole brand is built on the

509
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,340
protection of that intellectual property

510
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,950
and so when we as security professionals

511
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,540
start looking at that and how best can

512
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,730
we address some of those issues we have

513
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,230
to take those things into account right

514
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,290
so if you know if it's a person that

515
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,220
comes from academia

516
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,140
maybe it's some additional training that

517
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,120
needs to occur if it's someone from a

518
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,860
more open you know region of the world

519
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,650
where they don't particularly think of

520
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,050
like privacy is a good example right so

521
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:48,770
if you're right

522
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,220
you're having to look at the practice

523
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,900
regulations there we have to take very

524
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,660
specific steps as part of your program

525
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,220
and pay very close attention to those

526
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,820
things and I think that when we make

527
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,940
those priorities were more effective at

528
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,530
protecting our information other

529
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,040
question is

530
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,149
yes sir it back

531
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:56,430
I appreciate the making that baby okay

532
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,930
so question is what do we do if we

533
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,790
identify someone from a predictive

534
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,410
analysis perspective right so we've

535
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,640
predicted that this person is

536
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,610
susceptible to committing one of these

537
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,840
acts and the answer is so so I spend

538
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,420
most of my time around NSA in the

539
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,520
military right and the NSA you're gonna

540
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,870
always hear well it depends well we say

541
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,640
well can you know do we want to go after

542
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,160
this well it depends and the answer is

543
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,490
it depends you need to have a discussion

544
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,000
with Bob's manager and you know

545
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,880
leadership and kind of decide if the

546
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,560
risk is worth it because sometimes it is

547
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,960
and then it's up to you as a security

548
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,150
guy to figure out how to mitigate the

549
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,370
risk or how to put the tools in place to

550
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,200
prevent through you know the

551
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,460
eventualities of that encounter and

552
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,130
that's you know it's going to be

553
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,440
situational dependent does that answer

554
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,140
your question I know it's not a

555
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,330
clear-cut you know one zero answer and

556
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,310
that's what we love for every like one

557
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,770
or zero which one is it but it isn't a

558
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,290
one zero solution it's going to have to

559
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,730
be what works right for you or worse

560
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,600
right for the company

561
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,880
what's right for Bob because he hasn't

562
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,990
done anything wrong yet and you know we

563
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,990
believe that you punish people after the

564
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,640
crime not before right

565
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,590
so the question is at what part of the

566
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,210
hiring process does the security team

567
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:44,150
become involved so from a generic

568
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,760
standpoint that's going to be a question

569
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,590
that your security team needs to discuss

570
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,500
with HR I think that as we're talking

571
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,710
here as we're looking at Pam as a

572
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,480
concern there's definitely an argument

573
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,150
to be made to bring the security team in

574
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,660
that conversation pretty early again

575
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,549
that's going to it depends on what the

576
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,740
appetite is with Human Resources to

577
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,640
involve you in that discussion certainly

578
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,610
it would be prudent to look at very

579
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,470
sensitive positions and maybe have that

580
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,660
discussion earlier in the recruiting

581
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:21,740
process rather than after the fact but

582
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,419
with each company is just going to sort

583
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:25,940
of depend okay is that an answer

584
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:31,160
question my counsel is you know really

585
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,340
especially if you're an enterprise work

586
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,140
at building up good relationships and

587
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,110
partnerships across the enterprise right

588
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,059
you want security to be everyone's

589
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:43,100
friend not the person who's always

590
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,340
getting in the way right so how well

591
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,450
you're able to manage those

592
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,390
relationships is going to determine just

593
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,679
what kind of an impact that your

594
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,000
organization is going to be able to make

595
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,760
on that business right

596
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,460
I seen Walmart shaking his head yes

597
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:06,200
appreciate that yes sir

598
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,460
Thanks okay we're about out of time

599
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:08,480
you've got there one more question no

600
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,830
this doesn't affect your chances to win

601
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,560
the raffle although I wish it did

602
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,490
because then we'd probably get a

603
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,510
plethora of questions alright guys

604
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,620
thanks so much for your time your

605
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,670
attention really appreciate it

606
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,860
especially thanks for the questions I'm

607
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,450
much more of a discussion type person

608
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,390
than a lecture so thanks for coming out

609
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,040
today and be a part of the security

610
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,960
community voicing right now thanks guys

611
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,029
[Applause]
