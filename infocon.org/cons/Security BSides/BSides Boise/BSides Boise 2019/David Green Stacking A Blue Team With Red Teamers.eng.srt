1
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,380
speaker is David Greene and I'll let you

2
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,420
introduce your talk and just take off

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:20,810
here right here me good cool

4
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,140
all right so type of a talk is in Gloria

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,510
Security I don't feel like reading to

6
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,289
you so just keep going

7
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,590
one day

8
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,100
okay so Who am I my name is David Greene

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,860
I worked at Riot Games security analyst

10
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,820
before this I saved red team at rapid7

11
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,540
and then for that I did just different

12
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,920
information system stuff for the Marine

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,780
Corps this talk is more about how we

14
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,480
built a blue team with zero blue team

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,900
members capabilities that we thought

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,360
required to catch us make life a bit

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,530
harder and kind of warm a salute to blue

18
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,310
team because red team just kind of got

19
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,840
to get right once and then go from there

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,570
and it feels like every day taking Alice

21
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,950
blue team this talk is not technical so

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,420
there will be no code examples I will

23
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,590
not release anything on github

24
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,290
afterwards it's not the only way to do

25
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,430
things just the way we are doing things

26
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,560
but red team gets to share a lot you

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,330
know next time you see an exploit it

28
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,009
goes up on github everybody else gets it

29
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,540
chances are you're gonna see that in a

30
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,729
while very soon we don't have an easy

31
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,160
way to share so just trying to let

32
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,770
everybody know what we're doing and

33
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,110
hopefully it can help you and we can

34
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,009
learn I can learn from you guys

35
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,940
afterwards okay so it didn't we're gonna

36
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,610
talk a bit about our company culture

37
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,740
which makes some standard things like

38
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,360
which would consider best practices not

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,170
not applicable when it took to build our

40
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,149
team the capabilities were implemented

41
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,880
lessons learned and where we see the

42
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,049
future going in the next year

43
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,750
so some context a publisher of league of

44
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,440
legends so we're very focused on our

45
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,610
customer which in this case is our

46
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,590
player we want to hyper serve then we

47
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,660
want to make sure that every little

48
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,820
complaint they have we here we may not

49
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,710
agree with your complaints where you we

50
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,240
want you to feel hurt and we want to

51
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,260
make sure that we are catering to you

52
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,580
and we are your first and foremost

53
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,500
everybody is a gamer in some way shape

54
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,940
or form they enough maybe not be video

55
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,410
games feel like there's a person on our

56
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,810
team who just plays poker all the time

57
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,860
on the weekend common so our mission is

58
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,990
we aspire to be the most player focused

59
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,870
game company in the world that which can

60
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,040
come with a bunch of challenges because

61
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,210
developers you know we sit you down and

62
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,630
go through our in dog classes it's like

63
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,970
a week-long you come out of that you're

64
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,260
like alright I'm gonna give players

65
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,510
everything they want I'm gonna ship this

66
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,510
the codes gonna be awesome at least in

67
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,190
my opinion because every code I write is

68
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,900
it's amazing and everybody else's code

69
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,620
it's terrible

70
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,250
so this ship and they ship a lot of

71
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,950
things right so as of four years ago and

72
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,470
it's funny growth we have more

73
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,430
million active players in the game 27

74
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,710
million daily and seven a half million

75
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,360
concurrently so why would you attack us

76
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,890
well just like in another major tech

77
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,930
company out there we want to ship fast

78
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,730
everyone wants to be agile and when

79
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,170
you're doing that a lot of time security

80
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,300
just comes at the cost of speed you need

81
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,760
to ship your core game thesis before

82
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,280
anyone else does game development takes

83
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,580
years seven years eight years is not

84
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,970
abnormal

85
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,040
to take a game from nothing and ship it

86
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,860
so and if you're shipping a shooter or

87
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,640
you're shipping

88
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,570
pretty much anything unless you're

89
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,610
inventing a whole new genre it's a very

90
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,200
very red ocean out there

91
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,230
gamers are very opinionated and fickle

92
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,570
like they have only so much free time to

93
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,600
play and you know why if call duty isn't

94
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,010
working for you then you go play battle

95
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,988
you can play overwatch so we have to be

96
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:21,890
very sensitive that large attack service

97
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,330
right if you're especially if you're a

98
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,310
PC game maker like we need a support

99
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,110
back wall we no longer do but for a long

100
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,400
time we need to support back to Windows

101
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,140
XP so we have to have all these

102
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,669
different test environments around kind

103
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:33,169
of lock those down to make sure if

104
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:35,360
you're able to pop us you can basically

105
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,370
test rip your perfect test bed for

106
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,319
excellence

107
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,789
and not only that we're going to be

108
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:42,649
working in basically every major web

109
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,689
technology and you'll see so you'll see

110
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:46,999
anything from massive and ephemeral

111
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:48,619
container environments all the way down

112
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:50,569
to the oldest operating systems

113
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:54,830
unpatched it's if you're a you're a

114
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,659
non-us government entity and you want a

115
00:04:56,659 --> 00:05:00,649
place to play it's a good place and then

116
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:03,289
large scale like for any game company if

117
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:05,869
you're blizzard your us your about if

118
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:07,849
you get your source code popped and your

119
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,649
your distribution client because this

120
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:11,449
case say for example steam not saying

121
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:15,050
this happened but if your steam and you

122
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,240
get popped and all sudden you just you

123
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,219
know put a listener into 100 plus

124
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,889
million machines across the world if you

125
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,839
are not a nation state government I can

126
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,369
think of several that would pay a lot of

127
00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:27,789
money for that right off the bat so

128
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:29,779
while we do work in games in the

129
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:32,119
disclaim like the gravity of with we

130
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:36,469
fail horribly is it's really really bad

131
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,759
it would kill kill any company so

132
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,689
InfoSec team break down this is

133
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:44,089
generally the areas we work in we float

134
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:47,419
pretty heavily the red one security

135
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:48,999
operations is what this talks about

136
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:50,959
there are other talks about their

137
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,240
writers out there specifically around

138
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,939
popular security that if you're

139
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,459
interested at their although all right

140
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:01,430
so building setups so the way it used to

141
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,899
be was what I call 10th amendment

142
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:05,209
security if you weren't if it wasn't

143
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:06,830
this wasn't guaranteed to be platform

144
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,090
sec it wasn't something

145
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,250
right now you get this for sure it fell

146
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,310
under us and so because of that we got

147
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,160
overloaded and then 2013 and 2015 we had

148
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,160
a couple fairly bad breaches 2013's will

149
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,810
know with these within games because we

150
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,180
have our foreign password database

151
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,270
extracted albums and there was a lot of

152
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,180
credits lost to that 2015 that one was

153
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,030
pretty rough and we were basically like

154
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,220
alright we've got to change so too after

155
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,130
2015 the only thing we really learned

156
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,560
was that we were bad we didn't find out

157
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,570
about it someone else came to us like

158
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,919
manuals like hey we're investigating

159
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:45,260
something else guys might want to look

160
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,860
here and maybe here and also over here

161
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,610
great so we wanted to change that and

162
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,560
the only thing that we had essentially

163
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,510
was a really strong robust logging PI

164
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,870
point and that ends up becoming the

165
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,580
catalyst for everything they need to

166
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,570
know so we did a self-assessment like

167
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,240
what should we be doing are we currently

168
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,449
delivering any value how do we get there

169
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:15,229
and can we show the business value

170
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,479
tracing this book earlier but we have to

171
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,370
make sure that everybody knows what

172
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,370
we're doing this we don't want to be

173
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,810
that security team where it's like you

174
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,930
know it's a lot easier the core like the

175
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,340
quickest way to make sure a feature

176
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,070
doesn't ship is to invite security so we

177
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:35,660
don't want that so we came up these are

178
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,160
the five things that we think we should

179
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,530
be doing and are our stakeholders

180
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,570
stakeholders being the CISO and then his

181
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,780
fossils are aligned on this one

182
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,870
if anything we're working on does it

183
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,840
align with these it gets killed off

184
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,650
pretty quickly

185
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,450
Tracy makes sure it happens even though

186
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,700
it's somebody it's that project never

187
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,170
happened so so we're we delivering any

188
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,950
value so this is just a screen cap of

189
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:11,270
like maybe 15 minutes Obama so yeah we

190
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,610
have a shitload of logs we have a d-plus

191
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,330
petabytes of data across the company so

192
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,870
we have a lot of data but everything

193
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,280
else need to get burned on the ground I

194
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,110
think we did the whole process like

195
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,720
we're so manual you had to like oh mac

196
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,059
alert we're from Symantec how are you

197
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,590
gonna fix that you can't kick off an

198
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,719
automatic remote scan you can't if it is

199
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,010
actually compromised how are you gonna

200
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,419
get all the boxes because all these

201
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:41,750
really basic things we were missing and

202
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,789
I was not told we were missing those

203
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,650
things when I joined the company so that

204
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,630
was a fun thing to find out so how do we

205
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,190
get there

206
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,300
my manager is like all right well we

207
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,610
have three people who claim to be blue

208
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,230
team and everything and they were

209
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,330
overloaded so what we really want is

210
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,900
people who understand what an attacks

211
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,950
gonna do

212
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,709
and so the only real way to get that I

213
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:12,779
mean there are some people blue team who

214
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,459
gets it but it's really easy to just go

215
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,829
out and find like security consultants

216
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:18,630
oftens the guys people especially now

217
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,610
the rise that puts a lot of people who

218
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,950
leave government various branches and

219
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,389
know what they're doing and not just

220
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:27,449
American government so we want to

221
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:30,870
leverage their mindset right that's

222
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,029
actually how they got me in the ring and

223
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:37,139
I'm not bitter at all there's like how

224
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:38,430
many reports of you deliver how many

225
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,930
companies have you gone to it like you

226
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,399
pull up a report and last year you do

227
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,190
the same thing get in this sucks

228
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,920
I would like to fix this so they get to

229
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,410
you by saying you go you can fix this

230
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,850
and you get to build a network that's

231
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,500
gonna make it painful for yourself so if

232
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,870
you or maybe a little vindictive and you

233
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,639
want to cause other people paint this is

234
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,940
a great way to do it and then 3-woods

235
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,949
don't hire Turks like in our community

236
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:04,139
this is a problem like there are people

237
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:06,510
who want for whatever reason reward

238
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,970
Rockstar status and people become can be

239
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,980
really really difficult to work with but

240
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,870
at our company like you don't get

241
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,949
anything done without building

242
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:16,170
relationships it's all about who's going

243
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,519
to help you because I need something

244
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,350
done somebody else's work has to be

245
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,500
deprioritized and why is my time or what

246
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,149
I need more valuable than shipping for a

247
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:25,860
player so if you have somebody who

248
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,810
causes a lot of friction even though

249
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,220
they might be the best person in the

250
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,680
world of code we're never going to be

251
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,690
able to work with them because they well

252
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,820
we can't just chew in a silo by yourself

253
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,660
every day okay so we're actually very

254
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,449
fortunate we on our engineering blog we

255
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:44,670
have more in depth information like this

256
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,050
posted but for developers and security

257
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,490
falls on our engineering department we

258
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,410
have a very defined set of

259
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,540
we call masteries and we give you the

260
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,650
belts because we're nerds so you could

261
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,270
go obviously from white to black and

262
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,130
this is just four of the six major

263
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,990
things but it gives us a great framework

264
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,850
to say alright I would like to have a

265
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,120
mid-level security person and this is

266
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,050
where they would hit like they would

267
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,760
need to be an orange or red and a couple

268
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,180
of these things like two tops and then

269
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,620
everywhere else they would want them to

270
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,240
be like a yellow we have this idea that

271
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,280
we want a t-shaped engineer so we want

272
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,080
you to be really really broad but then

273
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,420
specialize in one or two places so it's

274
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,730
we do this every year you look down you

275
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,320
self assess and then your manage your

276
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,670
self assessments and if you mean they're

277
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,020
like just like come on white bells

278
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,730
across the work okay so and this is a

279
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,320
bit harder to see but I will release

280
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,380
this presentation how afterwards to look

281
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,120
in case anybody's interested but in

282
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,800
addition to that we say these are the

283
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,930
skills that we want all of our security

284
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,730
analysts to have we want you to have a

285
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,560
very base skill in all these and then of

286
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,270
course anywhere else we want you to may

287
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,600
be highly index in a couple things that

288
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,580
are tend to be unique towards ours and I

289
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,020
just really enjoyed the last talk was

290
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,170
that we have a lock threat up in a

291
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,990
station using human because surprise

292
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,070
surprise you have some of them in

293
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,930
concurrent players they have a bad game

294
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,000
it's kind of bad day chances are player

295
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,620
support is going to get death threats

296
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,640
I'm gonna come to LAX and shoot you up

297
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,200
we are going to blow up Madison Square

298
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,200
Garden why they're the only list goes on

299
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,150
like people get very very upset about

300
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:28,819
our games I'm one of them

301
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,750
it's not hard I still type in that's how

302
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,040
you don't get bad right so the other

303
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,839
thing that we're very big jobs we have

304
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:43,610
very short Job Description so we're

305
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,439
hiring like this is for a platform

306
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,509
security engineer these are this is just

307
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:49,220
barracks five bullets this is what we

308
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,399
well most the things that that got me to

309
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,889
come with her I was you see a job

310
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:56,000
description and it's like someone's

311
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,740
trying to like play pokemon and catch

312
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,259
all the different descriptions out there

313
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:01,639
like oh you want someone even is

314
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,009
networking you know tcp/ip what about me

315
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:06,079
how about DNS okay we get it

316
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,519
you also he knows network being cool

317
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,639
just say that so we kind of want

318
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:18,350
everything to be brief so we said we

319
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,329
want to break into three teams because

320
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:21,860
we feel like security operations covers

321
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,170
red blue and everything that supports it

322
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,910
so we have threat attack detection

323
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,949
response in the tool so threatened

324
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:30,079
attack are the people that whenever it

325
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,730
says do you have a red team a riot the

326
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,819
answer is yes they work inside threat

327
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:37,550
attack but people will float implode

328
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,930
everybody are to you should be able to

329
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,120
float across these they have their own

330
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,949
leads but you might do six months in

331
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:44,839
detection response and then you know you

332
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:46,579
may not like it or get burned out so

333
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:48,410
it's the dealer to do tooling or he sent

334
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,059
over to you threat attacks everybody

335
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:53,059
stays fairly well-rounded but threat

336
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:54,860
attack will do threat intelligence a lot

337
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,309
of ours is custom source we'll talk

338
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:00,439
about that a bit later we do read to you

339
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,959
as a service so there are some products

340
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,129
that we use where we have a product

341
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:06,410
catalog and say alright these X codes we

342
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,910
know work it leaves these forensic

343
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,160
artifacts and we have this scenario so

344
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,660
we can go to any environment and get

345
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,850
stakeholder by handling for example I

346
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,520
can go to

347
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,170
environment there's a lot of different

348
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,160
build environments to the different

349
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,990
types of software we ship all right well

350
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,310
what's the risk over here

351
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,320
run scenario and say alright see

352
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,450
actually we do have all your credentials

353
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,730
right here this would you turn get us

354
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,200
into github so you could and you didn't

355
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,459
configure everything right here so yeah

356
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,320
maybe you could just go inject fairly

357
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,459
quickly here if you were to get popped

358
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:37,020
and these also people to handle player

359
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,649
threats

360
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:40,529
so whenever lose the gum threat her

361
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:41,940
school shooting or anything else we

362
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,580
handle those and it's also a part of the

363
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,990
team that does an hour analysis and

364
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,830
research so that's that's like a reward

365
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,420
you're like I did a really good job it's

366
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,529
been three weeks just reversing

367
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:55,680
something detection response is kind of

368
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,779
what you would expect it is it's

369
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,980
forensic to scale but globally we're in

370
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,070
as you want to say at least 16 countries

371
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,890
with 20-plus offices so we would like to

372
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,680
be able to do over the wire forensics as

373
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,020
much as possible because nobody's going

374
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,089
to be getting a terabyte of a full disk

375
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:13,680
capture anymore especially and then

376
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,510
shipping across getting it out of Turkey

377
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,950
getting out of China through the Great

378
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:21,329
Firewall not easy and the tooling side

379
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:24,180
like mostly they helped us build tools

380
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,120
to make our life better or we hand off

381
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,680
tools to them like I made the super cool

382
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,120
script and then they come back and tell

383
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,630
you like ah not so fast

384
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,339
first thing so infrastructure is code

385
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,079
they want everything so you'll pass it

386
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,279
to them and they'll work on making sure

387
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,170
it stands up in Hanceville or a packer

388
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,730
and terraform so we can tear down

389
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,770
whatever you're running and bring it

390
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,320
back up make sure that we have really

391
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,839
really strong cyber liability anything

392
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,640
that becomes critical or a workflow like

393
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,080
me also we want to know when it fails so

394
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,520
ends up getting paged out we've had a

395
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,620
handful of things words like oh cool

396
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,750
logging pipeline went down for four

397
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,580
hours nobody knows not the most fun time

398
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,970
to explain that engineering like why

399
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,740
didn't it work so how did we get there

400
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,960
or how do we get there

401
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,170
security operations is essentially we

402
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,340
are the customer of two things

403
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,840
corporate security and platform security

404
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,430
platform security being people who are

405
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,780
primarily interested in the games and

406
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,370
their cloud footprint and corporate

407
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,370
security is everything else so and then

408
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,410
our customers are anybody who has been

409
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,290
like alright we want to have forensics

410
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,000
at scale we want to have all we think

411
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,500
whatever we have needs to be protected

412
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,540
more than just what's coming from

413
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,460
corporate security so please help us

414
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,680
it's important to establish this because

415
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,060
you know you can get overloaded because

416
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,160
most people think all right my job in

417
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,080
sprint six are my job is instant

418
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,430
response and I'm responsible for the

419
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,470
whole company but if your tooling suite

420
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,670
and everything else isn't there

421
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,710
yeah you might technically be but as

422
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,790
long as everybody else can acknowledge

423
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,340
it's gonna be in a degraded state you

424
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,770
will hopefully come out better because

425
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,270
otherwise you should have many many

426
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,589
sleepless nights worried about things

427
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,209
that are way beyond your control

428
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:11,410
so controlling your scope that way is

429
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:15,349
it's a lifesaver honestly and it allows

430
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,510
you to have nice metrics check in the

431
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,619
box for management

432
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,150
we awarded this week a new environment

433
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:26,000
today we're doing something so one of

434
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,220
the things we have to have is minimal

435
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,510
minimal impact to shipping anything any

436
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,640
features so our endpoint solutions

437
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,590
generally we don't want you to increase

438
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,760
anything that's going to increase the

439
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,799
bill types or it has to be negligible

440
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,299
because we've run a game as a service we

441
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:42,679
want to ship a major patch every two or

442
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:44,929
three weeks there's a ton of bills that

443
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:49,130
go involved with this so if you if we

444
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,590
increase bill climb by 10x by 15 exits

445
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,049
and noticeable we don't want you we

446
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:55,460
don't want to delete na malicious files

447
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,429
we had a lot of problems with that we're

448
00:17:58,429 --> 00:17:59,600
like you know hey we're a software

449
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,330
company we make new software I realize

450
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,620
you haven't seen this software in awhile

451
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,190
before

452
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,789
please stop deleting it and then we need

453
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:09,559
to do is we want software that just

454
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,330
reports on all of our processes just be

455
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:14,179
a snitch I can go back as long as I save

456
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:16,159
the data in the login pathway I can run

457
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,840
an investigation six months back no

458
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,059
problem as long as I have it contrasted

459
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:22,490
that the logs and the snitching is done

460
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:29,809
properly so we're good metrics for us we

461
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,909
actually have no idea so if you anybody

462
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:33,350
has a good idea what

463
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,080
what this looks like please this is

464
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,549
actually I pulled up earlier this week

465
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,700
you can see that we ignored 27,000

466
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,950
alerts fantastic so implementing

467
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:51,309
capability asleep how we did it was

468
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:53,600
everyone gets upset when security is

469
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,120
like all right this is the this we want

470
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,529
to protect for this audit finding or we

471
00:18:57,529 --> 00:18:59,120
think this is the best way to do it and

472
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,590
this is risky because everybody's gonna

473
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,970
push back we happen to be the company

474
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,090
where most people are real subject to

475
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,669
magic matter experts in the field and if

476
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:09,409
you come to them with some like well

477
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:11,179
this is the risk and you know they know

478
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:13,100
it better than you you just lost all of

479
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,529
your credibility with them so you have

480
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,179
to be very very careful with that so

481
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:19,730
what we did is we came up with a tent

482
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,200
where we think the ten things that would

483
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,549
kill the company the most like if this

484
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:24,919
happened tomorrow we have to shut our

485
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:27,620
doors were we're just on and then the

486
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,710
c-suite came back I said well these are

487
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,659
the 10 things we think of so and there's

488
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:34,009
some haggling back and forth and they

489
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:36,710
sacrifice their system to the gods and

490
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,190
we came up with the strategy or a list

491
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,389
of 10 environments that are the most

492
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,039
important things we want to protect and

493
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,289
their stack rank though and then after

494
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:47,330
that it was build relationships with

495
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,919
these teams motivations with the team

496
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:50,720
leads the product owners everybody's

497
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,429
going to be difficult so you got to

498
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:54,679
figure out how to handle them so that's

499
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:56,570
kind of a little about humans so if you

500
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,889
like the human talk the last one

501
00:19:57,889 --> 00:19:59,259
figuring out how to deal with people

502
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:02,620
that's a trick

503
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,940
so we said these are the kind a lot of

504
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,160
where you slide I'm really sorry for

505
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,550
that so this is what we think kind of

506
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,960
like a five-star experience would look

507
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,880
like if you're working in a sock now we

508
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,860
want to make sure that anything that we

509
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,420
think is Alyssa or anything that comes

510
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,560
in through threat Intel just gets

511
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,050
automated get to birth through it gets

512
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,760
to now analyze and they kicked out to

513
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,160
our pipeline so we can push it across

514
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,470
the rope anyway this is just mostly for

515
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,450
atomic because dealing with atomic is

516
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,970
you know its base level one I think it's

517
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,050
not where you want to end but it's a

518
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,450
good place to start but everything

519
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,730
should go on a single pane of glass so I

520
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,400
don't want to be in Palo Alto looking

521
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,540
for things and I don't want to be

522
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,550
looking carbon black or anything else

523
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,240
like that I want whatever they have

524
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,170
turned into like whatever the law of

525
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,730
karma has brought in normalize and and

526
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,050
kicked out to what I want to see because

527
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,070
every time somebody has to switch

528
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,050
context you're losing time they're

529
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:55,880
losing

530
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,550
lose focus and it makes it much harder

531
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:05,370
to hand off a ticket so threshold

532
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,500
reaching a threshold of severity that

533
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,190
point is a little bit more tricky we

534
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,690
still have quite solved how we want to

535
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,760
handle threshold but we definitely

536
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,840
figure out how to suppress rights if

537
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,460
anybody has a good idea on temporal

538
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,450
that's what we're trying to solve right

539
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,640
now so if you see an alert and it

540
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,770
happens here then we want to look look

541
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,240
five minutes after and five minutes

542
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,230
before four

543
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,630
for example recon commands there's a

544
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:33,510
concept so like oh yeah whenever I land

545
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,070
on a box I want to know who I am or run

546
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:35,730
Who am I

547
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,289
Oh who's running away my across my

548
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:39,809
environment Oh 30,000 hits also this

549
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:45,059
isn't work remediation work needs to be

550
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:47,460
automated this sucks because people are

551
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,809
going to download pups into lists and

552
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,429
somebody's got to clean them up so you

553
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:51,960
can do an automated way you're gonna

554
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,580
reduce your noise otherwise just going

555
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,840
to set their trigger over and over again

556
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,120
to your 27,000 parts that you've ignored

557
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,789
for the previous week and then

558
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:01,230
everything should be exposed via an API

559
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,990
we're being on building custom we're not

560
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,450
very good at integrating vendor products

561
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,720
the way they they think we should so

562
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,360
expose everything via API and then so we

563
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,049
can chain our home to link together so

564
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:18,659
how we work these are the main three

565
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:21,360
tenants like we deal with alerts a lot

566
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,649
everyone is in deal with alerts a lot

567
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:24,960
but alert is unplanned work you doing

568
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,250
I'm playing work you're just gonna crush

569
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,110
everything else going on so we do like a

570
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,669
lot of other places we want called a

571
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:33,059
spotter sniper or primary secondary but

572
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,320
we want to make sure that there's one

573
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,909
person who's primarily fielding all the

574
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:37,649
things that suck and in turn they can

575
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:40,010
help automate it away the next week

576
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,240
project work if you're not on primary

577
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,559
then you're gonna be available for

578
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,549
project or gonna be attached to

579
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:45,840
something there's not going to be a lot

580
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,210
of downtime but then flexibility like

581
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:52,169
you you might have every Friday somebody

582
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:53,580
come and say oh I did this thing

583
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,429
oh I posted this to github this AWS key

584
00:22:56,429 --> 00:22:57,620
or something else and then you've got

585
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,570
to remediations everybody's got to be

586
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,010
flexible you need to be at least as

587
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,659
flexible and your company's deployment

588
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:07,669
cycle is so where we play we improve

589
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:12,440
capabilities we we reduce log burden

590
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,510
like if you're all locking every packet

591
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,919
that comes through like we do we're

592
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,320
doing you can get a multi-million dollar

593
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,320
bill - fantastic

594
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,590
we tie capabilities together via mostly

595
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,710
via an API chaining and then we know we

596
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,870
advise people say like you know we want

597
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,870
to do this how can you know when they're

598
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,700
gonna come to you or the dream is for

599
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,899
them to come to you and say we want to

600
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:37,730
do this how do we do this securely first

601
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,500
we may not know how you do it securely

602
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,299
right off the bat because somebody will

603
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:44,000
or we will know what we'd respond that

604
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,480
apartment

605
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,630
so for us we always like to be moved in

606
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,220
early and give advice on how we can make

607
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,100
life easier and better for them what we

608
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,080
don't do is we don't implement brand new

609
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,460
capabilities so what we do have a full

610
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,100
packet capture and we request it for a

611
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,480
lot of time like we're at the mercy of

612
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,679
somebody else to do that rather than

613
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:02,659
that and usually a corporate security

614
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:04,940
and they did a fantastic job I mean when

615
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,830
you're when you're living in alerts

616
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,590
every day is painful especially a couple

617
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,870
in the red state right you you get in

618
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,120
quickly you can pivot quickly you just

619
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,980
the speed that you can move when you're

620
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,140
on offense as compared to defense is so

621
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,210
much higher and so you feel a lot of

622
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,559
pain there but you have to be very

623
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:24,110
careful you need to have other teams

624
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,179
ownership other teams by them to be

625
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:29,820
successful we don't do

626
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,889
maintenance a whining pipeline we just

627
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:34,799
try and make it better it's not our job

628
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,350
to make you logs to us so you have

629
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,369
to ship your own you have to maintain

630
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:40,559
that and we don't do I am off or

631
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,789
anything like that we just do device so

632
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:47,190
vendor Commandments we cannot these are

633
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,809
the three things you have to meet all

634
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:50,629
these and we won't bring the product in

635
00:24:50,629 --> 00:24:53,100
ship logs in a standard format because

636
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,869
they spend a lot of time like kind of

637
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:56,639
few I mean I worked around at seven but

638
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:58,559
if you watch they do say what they want

639
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,529
everybody's logs to go into or all those

640
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:03,239
things that unified you buy and that's

641
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:03,899
fantastic

642
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:07,139
but we don't want to live it so ship us

643
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:09,479
your logs in a standard format we need

644
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:14,659
to give us a quick and clean back out

645
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:16,440
anybody else here has had this problem

646
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,599
but I can think of two security products

647
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,669
where six months down the road I'm still

648
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:21,599
trying to kill this all in my

649
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:22,859
environment and don't know how it got

650
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:26,580
back in the first place and then expose

651
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,649
an API to access your features who you

652
00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:30,710
see you you spent all this time making

653
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:34,470
awesome things let us pull down the

654
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:38,729
information that we need so over the

655
00:25:38,729 --> 00:25:41,159
past 18 months we have spent a

656
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:42,840
substantial amount of time improving

657
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,599
blogging pipeline doing net flow

658
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:47,340
summarization has been one of the

659
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,190
biggest wins that we've seen to

660
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,350
be reducing our AWS cost and we still

661
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,180
get a full at least for TCP we get a

662
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,520
full summary of what the connector that

663
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,380
looks like you can't have easily do it

664
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,270
UDP we're trying to solve it but at

665
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,710
least we're not seeing a log of it

666
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,990
generated multiple times both in the IDs

667
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,540
and from the net flow themselves for

668
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,720
each individual packet improving

669
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,270
endpoint visibility this one is

670
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,160
considered a win because we have

671
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,570
basically nothing and a ton of

672
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,790
environments and when we kicked our

673
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,760
lightweight stack out to just endpoints

674
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,200
and developers didn't have a problem

675
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,690
building code they wanted us to start

676
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,280
moving it into their server environment

677
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,920
where it can so we went from some

678
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,200
visibility into corporate and almost

679
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,560
nothing into production to you know I

680
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,000
would say probably eighty to ninety

681
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,250
percent disability where we wanted it so

682
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,530
over 18 months that's that's really huge

683
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,690
especially in developer trust which is

684
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:44,770
the currency that is hard to come by

685
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,120
standard echo space detection strategy

686
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,420
spoiler it's attack matrix already

687
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,100
attack everyone else do you think it's

688
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,820
so high right now

689
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,940
it's fantastic don't get too lost in

690
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,600
metrics baseline include an indicator

691
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,600
database so we use in this but if you

692
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,860
are doing anything with Fred and tell

693
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,270
you can start taking in wolf or friend

694
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,290
until feeds you're gonna want to

695
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,820
indicate your database because you need

696
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,970
to be able to go code around single pane

697
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,560
of glass for analysts we finally got

698
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,920
this certain vendors made it really hard

699
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,350
but now one person can come in and

700
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,240
everything comes in fully enriched and

701
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,820
you can write well we only care about

702
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,800
you making the first decision on what to

703
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,330
do in this pane across you don't need to

704
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,950
work investigation from here but

705
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,270
everything that's presented to you you

706
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,790
should be able to say all right the next

707
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,070
step is this is this an incident or is

708
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,650
this something I can close and if you

709
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,740
have to leave there

710
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,809
leave this pane of glass to make your

711
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:43,470
next decision we are failing ingest and

712
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,169
rapidly act on threat Intel can't talk

713
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:47,880
too much about this but we are proud of

714
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,320
the fact that like whenever a couple of

715
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,460
a doctor groups that they are tracking

716
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,460
whenever their new stuff hits DTI or

717
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,010
anywhere else within within 24 hours we

718
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,870
have everything updated for us that we

719
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,289
know if they're coming back there is

720
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:04,130
CICP pipeline this has been a godsend

721
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,120
specifically for carbon block rule II

722
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,880
processor I find a you know how if I

723
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,500
want to write a detection I make a pull

724
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,720
request somebody approves it and within

725
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,809
five minutes it's not only is it life

726
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:17,490
but he just kicked out across the

727
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,070
network to the curb to see if the

728
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,549
detection actually hits agree on

729
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:26,120
standards for for production products

730
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,950
you just standardized like you could

731
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,730
write in whatever you want but don't you

732
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,529
know don't expect your Perl script to

733
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:35,789
make it in a product needs to be

734
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:37,140
something that somebody else can

735
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,990
maintain and then build relationships

736
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,659
outside of security you know especially

737
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:44,760
council that's a good one to have a

738
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,529
friend in your legal team and then

739
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:52,080
lessons learned okay email alerts suck

740
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,080
please stop giving me email alerts so

741
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,510
you wake up and it's like I have 9,000

742
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,100
where it's awesome not gonna check out

743
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,779
nobody's going to check on find a

744
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:03,000
different way slack alerts is only

745
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,740
slightly better but still called you I'd

746
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,480
to control workflows and I hold that's

747
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,919
why I didn't single pane of glass it is

748
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:13,289
so painful to have to switch from your

749
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:15,149
firewall to your next

750
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:16,589
appliance anything else to try and get

751
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,659
information don't do that just try and

752
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:20,279
fork it into a one thing whether it ends

753
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,869
up being like an orchestration solution

754
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:25,919
or not figure out what works for you but

755
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,769
don't live in multiple environments

756
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:29,879
thinking capabilities instead of tools

757
00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:32,580
say I want full packet capture or not I

758
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,369
walk Milwaukee it's ok to fail

759
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:37,169
everybody exercise to blue team to fail

760
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:38,789
so if you comfortable it if you're on

761
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:40,469
the red team sucks to fail because ever

762
00:29:40,469 --> 00:29:41,879
and then the blue team's like I can beat

763
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:42,269
you

764
00:29:42,269 --> 00:29:47,190
it feels terrible so it's ok to fail and

765
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,969
fail with your team unknown unknowns are

766
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:52,259
still mysterious one of the biggest

767
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:54,509
values that our red team has is letting

768
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:55,830
us know where we are going

769
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,169
like we're fine we feel much more

770
00:29:58,169 --> 00:29:59,609
comfortable if we know we are blind in

771
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:02,690
an area then we have no idea why they're

772
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,029
alright and another future so I can't

773
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:10,080
put this back in the bottle AWS GCP

774
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,969
Azure they're already here they're

775
00:30:11,969 --> 00:30:15,269
coming even more and so know how to work

776
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:19,649
in these environments just you can't if

777
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:20,969
developers say we love it

778
00:30:20,969 --> 00:30:24,960
you're getting it and then finally kinda

779
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,409
ya figure bigger presence in China for

780
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,869
us specifically and getting forensic

781
00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:32,849
data across because every country has

782
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:36,450
very weird security norms like Brazil

783
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,570
and Korea if you want to access web

784
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,889
banking cool you can basically gonna

785
00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:42,659
download a Trojan that guarantees that

786
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:45,029
only the browser is running web browser

787
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:46,589
processes access to anything this one

788
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:48,419
time and if you have custom detection

789
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,119
based off of what malware does

790
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,839
congratulations you've just flagged all

791
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:53,549
of Korea and Brazil as a malware that

792
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:54,700
sucks

793
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,669
so I hit time and that's actually the

794
00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:01,179
end of my presentation so we don't have

795
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:04,359
time for questions cool if you have a

796
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:07,739
question or two we have two minutes

797
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:19,819
[Applause]
