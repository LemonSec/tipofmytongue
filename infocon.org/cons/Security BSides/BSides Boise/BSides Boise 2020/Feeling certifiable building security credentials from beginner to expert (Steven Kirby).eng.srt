1
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:12,320
all right

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,239
three two one and go

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,000
good evening i hope everyone's had a

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,760
pleasant day and learned as much as i

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,519
have from besides

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,880
idaho 2020 i'm steve kirby and i'm a

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,640
security engineer with bright spring

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,599
health services in louisville kentucky

9
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,200
i want to talk about a subject that's

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,440
near and dear to my heart today which is

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,360
i.t certifications and security

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,920
certifications in particular

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,760
before we get started i want to mention

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,600
that if you notice down at the bottom

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,320
there is a

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,800
tiny url address you might want to jot

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,000
that down or

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,239
make a screenshot that will get you a

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,600
link to where you can download the

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,920
slides because people seem to

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,039
like to do that and it was just easier

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,559
to do it this way than to

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,079
worry about shuffling them back and

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,719
forth so

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,959
if you want to come back and get that uh

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,640
after the session's over

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,840
it it'll it'll be there for you to see

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,360
i might tell you a little bit about

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,840
myself i'm a former graduate student in

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,040
history

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,400
uh many many years ago i worked for

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,200
almost 10 years as a reference librarian

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,159
and kind of fell

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,640
into it work started off running a small

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,119
artist off lantastic network

36
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,079
sharing cd-rom databases back in the

37
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,159
late 1980s and that

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,240
moved and moved on to nobel netware and

39
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,320
then discovered unix

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,840
and spent 26 years of my life as a

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,759
unix systems administrator i've worked

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,880
with some

43
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,159
really old crusty stuff so uh i won't

44
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,000
bore you with the details but

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,719
it a lot of it now is museum grade stuff

46
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,880
uh along the way i picked up an interest

47
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,759
in

48
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,399
security work as i tell people mostly as

49
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,759
a means of preserving paycheck

50
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,200
continuity

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,598
because a lot of the systems i worked on

52
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,720
were

53
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,080
high profile to somebody

54
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,480
from somebody's perspective and having a

55
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,000
security breach would not have been a

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,920
good thing

57
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,239
i have earned a dozen security

58
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,120
certifications in the last few years

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,879
and that's important especially for talk

60
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,959
like this because you know somebody who

61
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,040
has certifications obviously is well

62
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,760
informed

63
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,080
and knows what they're talking about

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,000
i've got some of mine listed there

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,319
uh there are others but those those will

66
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,480
give you some idea of what i'm what i'm

67
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,879
about

68
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,319
i should open with a disclaimer that uh

69
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,200
the views

70
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,720
the next opinions that are expressed

71
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,360
here are entirely my own my employer

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,040
hasn't screened them hasn't approved

73
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,519
them in fact most of the people i work

74
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,879
with don't even know that i'm doing a

75
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,640
presentation today

76
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,159
so this is this is entirely me

77
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,640
and my employer should be held blameless

78
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,079
and all that good stuff

79
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,879
the question we're going to ask is are

80
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,720
you certifiable and people have been

81
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,239
telling me for years that i

82
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,480
am and i thought i thought it was a

83
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,920
compliment i thought they would were

84
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,280
saying that it would be easy for me to

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,920
get

86
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,959
certified in it's things i don't think

87
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,720
that's what they meant

88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,959
but uh the question we need to ask is

89
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,080
can you do it and

90
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,720
the answer is of course yes it's not all

91
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,480
that difficult

92
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,879
uh certifications have a lot of

93
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,200
advantages over formal education for

94
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,239
example

95
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,280
uh a university degree or

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,599
maybe some specialized study and i say

97
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,560
that

98
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,000
speaking is from the perspective of

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,840
someone who spent 25 years

100
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,799
in higher education i believe in it but

101
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,720
there are advantages that certifications

102
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,519
offer over

103
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,480
conventional higher education number one

104
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,080
and possibly the most obvious is that

105
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,720
it's faster

106
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,159
a four-year degree takes four years uh

107
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,920
once you get started i guess you could

108
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,400
possibly knock out some certifications

109
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,439
in a matter of weeks uh it's also

110
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,480
cheaper higher ed

111
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,680
is not as not the value it was people i

112
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,239
work with

113
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,639
are stunned to find out that when i've

114
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,560
graduated from

115
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:29,840
college excuse me

116
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,400
sorry about that the

117
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,960
lights are apparently on a timer when i

118
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,000
graduated from college

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,520
back in the late 1970s uh

120
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,560
tuition was about 15 a credit hour

121
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,639
it's gone up considerably since then and

122
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,560
of course the other advantage

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,360
that certifications have are that they

124
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,000
are more focused on job skills

125
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,160
so it makes it easier to apply what

126
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,080
you've learned

127
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,919
to any positions you might be trying to

128
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,320
obtain

129
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,880
now it helps to have a framework if

130
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
you're trying to decide

131
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,199
what certifications you want to perceive

132
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,880
the one that i settled on

133
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,160
was the department of defense's 8570 or

134
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,919
8140 regulations

135
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,680
originally it was 8570 8140 is the

136
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,039
updated version

137
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,479
and there's a link there at the top of

138
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,080
the page

139
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,560
uh it's a little bit more complicated

140
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,160
than what i've got displayed here but

141
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,600
basically

142
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,880
uh these regulations divide

143
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,240
it certifications into two groups one

144
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,840
the iet group which would be for

145
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,440
technical people who do hands-on work

146
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,320
and the other for managers labeled iam

147
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,400
there are there's a little bit of

148
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,240
overlap between them uh some

149
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,080
certifications could be used for either

150
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,440
category

151
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,240
but uh by and large it it separates out

152
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,880
two different

153
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,440
distinct paths depending on what sort of

154
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,960
positions that you think you might want

155
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,160
to apply for

156
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,199
now or in the future

157
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,039
it's going to do a little bit of what i

158
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,680
call exception exception handling

159
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,120
we're going to go back and talk about

160
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,960
some of those certifications

161
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,520
from the dod in a moment but i want to

162
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,000
mention

163
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,720
first of all microsoft's mta

164
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,160
certifications which are not

165
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
part which are not included on that list

166
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,759
they don't have the department of

167
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,440
defense's blessing

168
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,960
there are quite a few of them they're

169
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,639
entry-level certifications that are

170
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,039
geared towards

171
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,520
high school students or college students

172
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,080
or

173
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,240
people are looking to change jobs like

174
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,360
for example

175
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,960
someone who's been working on a help

176
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,800
desk and

177
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,360
is looking to make a transition into

178
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,599
something a little bit more advanced

179
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,680
they offer three that i would recommend

180
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,880
highly

181
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,800
one for network fundamentals that would

182
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
be introduce you to

183
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,199
basically windows networking and some

184
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,599
tcp

185
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,599
security fundamentals and then windows

186
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,720
servers fundamental

187
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,840
server fundamentals because those are

188
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,759
the network fundamentals and server

189
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,360
fundamentals

190
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,680
certifications talk about assets those

191
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,800
are the things that the security

192
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,479
professionals were trying to

193
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,400
protect and so it helps to have an

194
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,080
understanding of what those are

195
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,370
about hey steve steve can you hear me

196
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,120
[Music]

197
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,240
yes um you're uh you're

198
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,560
you're not advancing the slides for the

199
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,039
uh for the viewer

200
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,280
hmm

201
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,639
where do we get to yeah steve we're on

202
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,520
the first slide

203
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,880
you might have to kill your share and

204
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,639
then re-share possibly yep

205
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,520
looks like it thank you sorry that's all

206
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,240
right

207
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,360
how's that perfect thanks good deal

208
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,039
okay and there's the the dod 8570 list

209
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,240
that i mentioned

210
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,319
uh that could be that's a very useful

211
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,440
framework for

212
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,360
selecting certifications that you might

213
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,199
want to pursue

214
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,560
i mentioned microsoft's mta those are

215
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,000
the ones that i would recommend

216
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,639
most but there are others in addition

217
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,560
for example you wanted to learn about

218
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,080
sql server databases or other microsoft

219
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
technologies

220
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,159
that would be one avenue to pursue and

221
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,080
we'll talk about that a little bit later

222
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,519
and when we talk about

223
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,599
uh strategies for pursuing certification

224
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,120
i also want to mention cisco they have

225
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,640
recently revamped

226
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,680
a lot of their certification program

227
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,360
a lot of the certificates that were

228
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,720
listed on the

229
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,160
department of defense site

230
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,560
no longer exist or have had the names

231
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,080
changed

232
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,360
one that has had the name changed is the

233
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
cyberops certification and that one's

234
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,640
still around

235
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,440
uh but it is an entry-level

236
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,399
certification

237
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,399
that would be really useful if you're

238
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,519
looking for

239
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,399
a career in network security it's it's

240
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,680
designed to

241
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,080
uh obviously provide that sort of

242
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,640
background

243
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,000
one that has kind of gone by the wayside

244
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,279
there used to be

245
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,680
separate uh certifications for separate

246
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,279
ccna their

247
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,080
middle level uh network associate

248
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,240
certifications for security and other

249
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,560
other tools those have all been combined

250
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,519
into one

251
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,560
ccna exam so you don't have that option

252
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,000
available to you anymore

253
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,200
but it's it's not useful to note that

254
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,600
those do exist on the

255
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,360
department of defense site but you won't

256
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,279
be able to actually take the take those

257
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,240
starts any longer

258
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,480
which leads us to some certification

259
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,920
bodies

260
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,600
there are several that are that bear

261
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,839
special attention

262
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,519
one would be comptia the computing

263
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,079
technology industry association

264
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,760
and they are a very common very popular

265
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,160
uh

266
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,040
supplier of certification services

267
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,160
ranging from

268
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,640
lower level certs like a plus or network

269
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,680
plus here

270
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,760
which would be comparable to the

271
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,440
microsoft

272
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,519
network fundamentals certification that

273
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,640
i mentioned

274
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,560
security plus which is probably the best

275
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,320
known entry-level certification

276
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,040
available and then other more more

277
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
advanced certifications like cloud plus

278
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,399
which obviously deals

279
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,519
with cloud solutions their cysa

280
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,200
which is a blue team cyber security

281
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,360
analyst i believe is what stands for

282
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,519
uh certification that teaches you how to

283
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,760
deal with computer incidents

284
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,040
and how to protect assets pen test plus

285
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,600
the name

286
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,880
is reasonably descriptive uh it is

287
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,680
to teach people who are interested in

288
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,959
penetration testing

289
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,160
and offensive security and then last but

290
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,800
not least

291
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,720
is the casp plus which is their top

292
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,120
level uh certification

293
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,200
uh for people with about 10 years of

294
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,240
experience

295
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,760
it is a hands-on technic techie

296
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,240
certification as opposed to some others

297
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,600
that we'll talk about

298
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,040
here in a minute it's designed for

299
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,880
it's not designed necessarily for people

300
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,560
who want to be managers

301
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,200
but it's designed for people who want to

302
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,000
be doers

303
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,440
and actually uh

304
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,560
be involved in day-to-day

305
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,279
uh technical operations and i i possess

306
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,920
that one

307
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,000
and value it very highly

308
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,760
one neat thing that comptia started

309
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,440
doing a couple of years ago is what they

310
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,160
call

311
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,040
stackable certifications and what that

312
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,279
allows you to do is combine

313
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,720
one or two or more uh certifications

314
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,000
together and derive a third an a third

315
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,880
certification

316
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,760
for example security plus and their

317
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,480
cloud plus certification gets you

318
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,360
secure cloud professional so it's a way

319
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
of validating that you have

320
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,880
uh a skill set that transcends

321
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,680
one particular the the confines of one

322
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,719
particular search

323
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,399
isc squared or the international

324
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,320
information systems security

325
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,040
uh certification consortium is another

326
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,120
popular certification body

327
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,279
and they produce two certifications that

328
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,120
we'd want to talk about

329
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,240
one is the sscp the system security

330
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,360
certified

331
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,760
practitioner that is an entry to

332
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
intermediate level certification

333
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,440
and it may be one of the best values on

334
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,680
the certification market

335
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,920
you could take this test for about 250

336
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,040
dollars

337
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,320
as opposed to over 300 i think is the

338
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,000
standard asking price for most of

339
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
comptia certs some are even more

340
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,480
expensive than that

341
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,959
ise squared awful also offers the cissp

342
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,120
or certified information system security

343
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,160
professional

344
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,760
and that is probably the gold standard

345
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,760
for advanced

346
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,240
security certifications a lot of people

347
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,279
i know

348
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,399
have that is that that's on their

349
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,800
professional bucket list they they want

350
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,319
to achieve that certification

351
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,240
once they have done that they they they

352
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,600
feel like they will have

353
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,519
gone as far in their profession as they

354
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,480
as they need to go

355
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,519
a possible alternative alternative to

356
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,800
isc squared

357
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,440
is isaca which formerly had a long name

358
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,120
and decided sensibly

359
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,920
to change it to just isaca and they

360
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,839
offer three certifications i'd like to

361
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,839
mention the first is a relatively new

362
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,880
one

363
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,600
the csx cybersecurity fundamentals which

364
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,079
is

365
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,480
an entry-level certification but it's

366
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,760
not as basic

367
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,480
in its approach as say security plus or

368
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,160
the microsoft search

369
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,560
uh it's a little i thought it was a

370
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,920
little bit more difficult when i look at

371
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,680
the sample questions

372
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,760
uh the nice thing about this is that as

373
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,959
opposed to

374
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,279
some other certification bodies you

375
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,079
don't have to

376
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,600
there's no continuing education

377
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,199
requirement

378
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,519
so in addition to getting the isaca name

379
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,639
behind it

380
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,560
you don't have to go go through conti

381
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,399
and have continuing education

382
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,160
in order to keep the certifications

383
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,399
current virtually all comptia

384
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,680
certifications and all

385
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,480
of the ise squared uh certs do have that

386
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,959
requirement

387
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,720
uh the one the high level cert from

388
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
most common high level search from isaka

389
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,639
would be the cism or cism the certified

390
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,600
information security manager and that's

391
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,279
another popular one that would be a

392
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,480
counterpart to the cissp i know a lot of

393
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,160
people who have both

394
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,440
uh apparently there's a lot of overlap

395
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,320
in the study so

396
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,519
if the folks i know have gotten one and

397
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,760
immediately launched into prepare for

398
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,440
the other because it cut down on the

399
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,360
amount of study time

400
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,880
and then last but not least is the cisa

401
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,680
or

402
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,839
certified information systems auditor

403
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,519
and that name is pretty much

404
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,480
uh self-explanatory it's designed for

405
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,600
auditors or

406
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,120
people who want to take charge of

407
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,519
insurance compliance and systems

408
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,079
management

409
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,519
so there we've got a very brief outline

410
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,480
of a possible

411
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,759
set of security uh certification path

412
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,120
uh you might want to begin with

413
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,279
something like the microsoft mta

414
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,399
or cisco cyber ops or some of the lower

415
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,680
level comptia

416
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,880
certifications and spend the first two

417
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,959
to five years of your career

418
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,399
built building out a foundation

419
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,199
based on those certs and as you get a

420
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,959
little bit more experience you could

421
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,040
then start to look at things like the

422
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,680
cisa cysa plus or

423
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,720
pentest plus even cloud plus or uh

424
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,320
the sscp and as a capstone

425
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,160
when you once you've got to maybe the 10

426
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,839
to 12 year

427
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,759
experience mark you might want to look

428
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,880
at something like cast

429
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,399
plus or the cissp or

430
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,120
cism if you decide the latter two would

431
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,320
be if you

432
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,000
perhaps wanted to go into management

433
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,199
i should make a little bit of a mention

434
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,199
about potential online training

435
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,160
providers because

436
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,480
some of these certifications can be

437
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,880
quite expensive to prepare for

438
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,120
unless you do it yourself or

439
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,639
do something other than the vendor

440
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,480
supply training uh

441
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,040
there's a nice market in vendor supply

442
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,399
training

443
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,160
and the market can be quite substantial

444
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,759
one source for training that i would

445
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,079
recommend would be pluralsight

446
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,520
uh very popular and a good source of

447
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,359
videos on

448
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,199
individual topics if you notice there

449
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,400
they've got uh the cissp and the cism

450
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,480
and security plus so

451
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,679
in most in most cases they're going to

452
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,079
have one course for certification

453
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,319
it will be very in-depth and very very

454
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,839
very well done i've been

455
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,400
a loyal pluralsight customer for a long

456
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,799
time

457
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,440
in addition to certification training

458
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,520
pluralsight i should mention also offers

459
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,480
training

460
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,000
in security tools things like splunk

461
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,039
for a seam or vulnerability scanning or

462
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,960
things like security frameworks

463
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,160
that could be useful for learning job

464
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,000
skills or

465
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,120
for continuing education as you move

466
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,239
along in your career

467
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,679
linkedin learning is another potential

468
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,160
source of training it's very similar

469
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,120
in a lot of ways to pluralsight it used

470
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,200
to be known as lynda.com and one p

471
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,320
one reason people like it

472
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,240
linkedin learning or lynda.com as a

473
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,280
source is it's often possible to get a

474
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,919
uh get free access to it from your local

475
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,600
public library

476
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,799
microsoft bought lynda.com about 18

477
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,320
months ago

478
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,240
i don't know how long they're going to

479
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,240
continue that policy

480
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,559
but i've talked to people that have done

481
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,919
it recently so

482
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,480
the program hasn't been revoked yet

483
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,400
again you're going to have

484
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,720
one one course per certificate one set

485
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,760
of courses

486
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,799
for certification uh

487
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,280
and they're also for the most part quite

488
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,600
good

489
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,280
one of my favorites is udemy udemy is

490
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,799
kind of a contrast to pluralsight and

491
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,760
linkedin learning you will they do offer

492
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,799
online

493
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,960
video courses and they're some of them

494
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,840
are quite good

495
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,080
some of them are not so it's kind of a

496
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,760
hit or miss proposition

497
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,480
but in this case you're going to have

498
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,760
possibly

499
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,160
a half dozen or so courses possibly even

500
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,520
more i guess

501
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,200
dealing with the same certification but

502
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,799
they're provided by different

503
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,520
uh individuals or different groups some

504
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,880
of them are better than others

505
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,320
some of them are a lot better than

506
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,360
others so it's important that when you

507
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,480
evaluate udemy

508
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,200
you look at things like the star rating

509
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,760
over here on the right hand side

510
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,600
it gives you some idea of what people

511
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,679
who have taken the course think of it

512
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,440
you also want to evaluate

513
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:53,840
not again

514
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,840
you also want to evaluate the

515
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840
last update because some of these

516
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,320
courses can take several

517
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,600
several years to develop and

518
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,880
they go out of date uh from time to time

519
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,360
sometimes they get left out on udemy for

520
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,720
purchase

521
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,919
even though they're dealing with an

522
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,520
older version of the certification

523
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,360
pack publishing is one of my personal

524
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,640
favorites

525
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,240
in addition to their relatively

526
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,840
inexpensive

527
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,159
uh subscription price you can actually

528
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,240
buy a lot of courses that are available

529
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,600
through udemy

530
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,360
and download them and take them with you

531
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,240
on your laptop

532
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,320
with pluralsight and linkedin learning

533
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,799
you can download to mobile devices

534
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,280
i don't recall if they have applications

535
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,559
for

536
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,400
pcs and macs or not but with linked with

537
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,240
pact you can get you can get a

538
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,159
subscription that would cover

539
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,080
uh a subset of what's on udemy anyhow

540
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,400
and in addition to that you get access

541
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,200
to

542
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,240
print with the electronic books uh

543
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,600
to go along with the videos

544
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,960
i will mention a few uh

545
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,280
instructors and publishers that i'm fond

546
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,480
of these folks

547
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,520
are both unpacked and on udemy

548
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,799
uh jason dion would be one

549
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,960
mike myers in total seminars would be

550
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,960
another and thor peterson

551
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,320
who specializes in the advanced level

552
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,799
certifications like cissp and schism

553
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,600
would be a third

554
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,120
cybrary is one a lot of folks are

555
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,559
familiar with

556
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,400
they've recently changed their business

557
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,720
model and i don't recommend them as

558
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,320
highly as i used to they've got some

559
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,919
good material

560
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,919
but it can get a little pricey these

561
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,919
days but it used to be no

562
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,600
it used to be well known because the

563
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
training was free and you paid for

564
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,159
certificates of completion but that has

565
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,720
changed

566
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
and last but not least i want to mention

567
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,360
professor messer

568
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,840
uh who offers courses through his own

569
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,159
website and then on youtube

570
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,159
free of charge he makes his money from

571
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,919
selling course notes

572
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,400
and other study materials printed study

573
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,600
materials

574
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,760
uh i haven't actually taken any of his

575
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,280
courses but i know several people who

576
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:23,840
have

577
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,000
who swear that they're quite good so i

578
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,120
recommend them very

579
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,320
recommending very highly

580
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,360
so to wrap up and summarize what we

581
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,640
talked about

582
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,720
credibility as a security professional

583
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
comes from a combination of experience

584
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,000
and credentials

585
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,919
the two are not con are not competing

586
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,000
they're complimentary lower level certs

587
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,039
like

588
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,039
credentials complement experience but

589
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,640
they don't replace it and vice versa

590
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,559
i think systems and networking

591
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,400
experience is essential for security

592
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,039
work

593
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,320
because they're a large part of the

594
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,159
assets we are protecting so it's

595
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,200
important to have a good

596
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,600
fundamental background in both systems

597
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,720
and networking

598
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,840
if you want to be a security

599
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,480
professional

600
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,000
things like passion hardening and

601
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,039
configuration skills can be reinforced

602
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,640
with security certifications

603
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,039
and of course as we mentioned even after

604
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,559
your career is launched

605
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,400
you'll need to earn continuing education

606
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,679
credits to keep most of your

607
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,720
certifications

608
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,559
and that means that learning never stops

609
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,960
hopefully this brief chat has provided a

610
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,000
a

611
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,679
overview of a potential framework for

612
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,320
chasing security certifications and a

613
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,760
reminder some of the

614
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,640
excellent low-cost means of learning i

615
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,640
think we have a few minutes left

616
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,240
i'll be glad to field any questions

617
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,799
yeah sure thanks steve thank you very

618
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,760
good information great resources there

619
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,400
there are

620
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,960
uh there is a question that we do have

621
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,039
i've transcribed it in there

622
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,200
okay also i noticed uh yeah you need to

623
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
tell your company to pay the power bill

624
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,840
there and it was

625
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,360
no i didn't lights went out a couple

626
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,200
times we were thinking maybe like put a

627
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,240
roomba and put a

628
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,880
uh maybe a broomstick uh with a witch

629
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,000
writing it or something

630
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,679
around in the back that's i think it

631
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,039
would take something like that i wasn't

632
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,400
prepared for that because

633
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,880
this we we moved out i moved out of this

634
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,799
building for a year

635
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,279
and when i left the lights would stay on

636
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,039
in perpetuity if i turned them on they

637
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,159
stayed on

638
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,880
apparently that has changed in the well

639
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,760
i was gone

640
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,679
well maybe we can hack into the light

641
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,360
system well but better

642
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,039
so let's get to the questions uh

643
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,960
question here so you mentioned a lot of

644
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,559
learning resources are there

645
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,240
is there a starting place for any

646
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,159
particular learning resources you would

647
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,080
recommend for somebody just starting out

648
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,679
like one of those you mentioned maybe

649
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,120
the starting place

650
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,559
i i would default towards pluralsight uh

651
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,760
in all likelihood uh it's not terribly

652
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,600
expensive if you want to buy a monthly

653
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,919
account for it it's about thirty dollars

654
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,279
i think linkedin learning is about

655
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,720
25 and if you want to gamble on one of

656
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,919
the udemy courses

657
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,960
you can often find them on sale for 10

658
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,320
to 15

659
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,400
and the nice thing about you to me is

660
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,080
that once you have access

661
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,240
to the course you've got it for life it

662
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,520
never expires

663
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,520
whereas pluralsight and lynda or

664
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,200
linkedin

665
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,720
are subscriptions that require an

666
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,320
ongoing commitment

667
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,840
but i would probably start with one of

668
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,520
those three that's a good point you

669
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,960
could buy them a la carte depending on

670
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,480
what you're interested in or if you want

671
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,159
a subscription model you could do that

672
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,000
as well and just kind of

673
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,080
go for the whole thing whichever works

674
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,279
best for you

675
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,279
all right uh also relating to that if

676
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,720
you're really interested in

677
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,720
just certification say you're interested

678
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,640
in cissp

679
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,720
is there a particular one of those

680
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,799
learning resources that might be better

681
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,200
than

682
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,640
another uh well the fellow who

683
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,000
wrote the cia wrote the cissp

684
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,360
training for ise squared as the one who

685
00:25:59,360 --> 00:25:59,760
does

686
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,720
the cissp preparation course for

687
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,559
pluralsight

688
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,000
that would probably be a good one to

689
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,640
start with um

690
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,440
for security plus i enjoy but jason

691
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,520
dion's is quite good the one that

692
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,159
mike myers you has produced is quite

693
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,080
good i would recommend either of those

694
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,600
for folks who are looking for an entry

695
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,799

696
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,279
peter thor peterson i mentioned who's on

697

udemy

698
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,480
and available through pac publishing

699
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,159
does a great job for cissp and cism

700
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,159
but doesn't do any of the entry-level

701
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,520
certifications so

702
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,320
and and professor messer uh for security

703
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,880
plus

704
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,039
and or network plus would be hard to

705
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,480
beat because those are those

706
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,640
