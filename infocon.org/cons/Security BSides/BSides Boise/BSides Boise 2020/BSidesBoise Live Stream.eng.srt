1
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,520
okay apparently we're live and i can't

2
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,239
see it but

3
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,520
uh hi everybody uh

4
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,320
this is uh jacob benjamin with

5
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,079
stenography

6
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,479
steganography i knew i'd screw that up i

7
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,080
told you i'd screw that up

8
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,520
in ot it's our campaigns oh yours buddy

9
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,840
thanks uh hello everyone yeah like like

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,360
i said my name is jacob benjamin

11
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,240
i'm going to talk to you about

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,040
steganography and how it can be used in

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,680
part with

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,640
uh ot cyber campaigns so campaigns

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,080
specifically against operational

16
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,240
technology such as those in critical

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,880
infrastructure

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,000
so it's just a little bit about myself

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,320
so

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,360
i do i work for dragos i am

21
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,799
a principal industrial consultant so for

22
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,400
critical infrastructure we go in and we

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,159
do uh architecture reviews

24
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,399
pen tests and things like that i

25
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,920
previously worked for inl

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,960
as well as duke energy and i've got some

27
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,399
research areas here you can see that

28
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,680
i've done

29
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,920
some steganography research and stuff in

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,759
the past

31
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,920
so the purpose of this uh is so i'm

32
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,360
going to talk about

33
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,799
some research that i did while i was at

34
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,399
the university of idaho

35
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,040
as well as a practical implementation of

36
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,479
the technique that i did

37
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,598
on a pen test while working for dragos

38
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,080
and so i'll also briefly cover some

39
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,599
mitigations and detections

40
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,800
uh for steganography

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,319
so um specifically we're gonna evaluate

42
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,239
so the research that i did was

43
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,319
uh evaluating the effectiveness of

44
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,360
opswat uh

45
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,840
kiosks and uh and other antivirus

46
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,000
solutions against steganography

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,319
and then uh we did it on some live

48
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,840
systems as well

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,360
so i'll talk more about that in a second

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,760
here but first we'll talk about

51
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,519
uh what is steganography so

52
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,040
steganography

53
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,160
is uh hiding or embedding secret data

54
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,280
uh into a medium like a file that should

55
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,160
be benign

56
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,200
but is now hiding malicious things or

57
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,640
just hidden things

58
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,920
so typically this looks like multimedia

59
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,680
containers such as videos

60
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,360
audio files network packets

61
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,879
and then most commonly images and so

62
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,440
um if you're if you're thinking about

63
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,120
technical goals here you could look at

64
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,959
like uh this is used for like defense

65
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,720
evasion if you're fluent in like the

66
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,599
miter attack

67
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,760
kind of language so you're looking at

68
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,120
like how can i

69
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,159
uh a fade evade defenses you might use

70
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,200
it for command and control

71
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,519
and it can also be used uh you know just

72
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,879
as obfuscation

73
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,959
uh you know so you're hiding data and

74
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,720
not maybe you're

75
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,480
you want to hide your malicious payload

76
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,879
or something like that

77
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,840
so often time oftentimes steganography

78
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,680
gets confused with encryption

79
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,879
and that's because they're they're both

80
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,560
kind of used for private communications

81
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:42,879
but

82
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,159
the concepts are actually quite

83
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,480
different so encryption

84
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,640
is used to communicate privately by

85
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,000
obscuring the message

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,400
and so you know nobody can see them or

87
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,920
they can see the message but it's all

88
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,599
scrambled right

89
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,400
whereas steganography is is about covert

90
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,319
communication and it doesn't obscure the

91
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,000
message so much as it obscures the

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,920
communication itself

93
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,120
um so some common like use cases for

94
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,640
steganography

95
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,280
uh well when in the past when i was

96
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,000
doing some

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,519
uh some work uh well so the most

98
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,560
legitimate use for

99
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,560
digital steganography is like watermarks

100
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,918
when you're looking at like

101
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,960
uh videos or images and stuff to combat

102
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,280
like

103
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,320
intellectual property piracy uh one of

104
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,840
the more nefarious uses for

105
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,040
steganography

106
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,280
uh it's very common in like uh child

107
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,800
pornography rings for

108
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,040
uh hiding uh illicit images

109
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,919
and then um it's also it's used with uh

110
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,199
like espionage

111
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,960
so and there's some common cases with

112
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,880
that like in uh in 2010 there were some

113
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,400
russian spies that were

114
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,520
that were caught using image

115
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,440
steganography for their covert

116
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,280
communications back

117
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,120
and then even just uh recently there was

118
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,440
a an advanced persistent threat

119
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,800
called ocean lotus and they used uh

120
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,520
steganography to conceal their malware

121
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,800
payloads

122
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,000
and so basically steganography allows

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,400
like a seemingly innocuous file

124
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,520
you know it could be a picture of an

125
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,280
animal or a landscape or in this case

126
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,560
the mona lisa

127
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,680
and um you you look at images and

128
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,199
and they're filled with uh other data

129
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,880
but it's important to realize that it's

130
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,880
not just images and videos and things

131
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,160
you can do this with

132
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,000
textual data you can do it with voip

133
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,400
data

134
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,080
all those kinds of things so

135
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,800
let's see next slide okay so a common

136
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,199
question

137
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,360
is like okay so how does this work well

138
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,520
the answer is it depends on the medium

139
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,320
that's used

140
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,680
and so i'm going to focus a little bit

141
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,680
on image steganography for two reasons

142
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,440
first because it's the most common form

143
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,800
of steganography

144
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,759
and then second because it's what i used

145
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,000
to evade both the opswat kiosk

146
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,919
as well as the antivirus on the gas

147
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,000
control networks

148
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,960
that i was pin testing so if you look

149
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,000
here at the slide

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,600
i've got some colors and they're

151
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,759
represented

152
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,600
represented in red green blue values you

153
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,880
see the numbers here

154
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,000
and then those numbers can be

155
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,560
represented as uh bytes

156
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,479
so you'll see you'll see them across

157
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,319
there right and so i picked out the uh

158
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,560
the teal looking color here and i've got

159
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,160
its red green blue values and then i've

160
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,360
got

161
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,440
i took the uh the last one the blue

162
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,880
value here you'll see that i've got it

163
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,440
split up

164
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,800
across its byte values so

165
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
and what seganography does is it takes

166
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,000
well in this case

167
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,680
we'll talk about least significant bit

168
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,440
steganography so

169
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,479
um so this is important because if i

170
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,440
change

171
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,280
the least significant bit you you're not

172
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,720
going to notice it'll have a very small

173
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,479
impact on the final value

174
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,160
um you know if i was to change that

175
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,080
first one it would you know the color

176
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,520
would be completely different but if i'm

177
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,880
changing the last one it's not that

178
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,400
different so you see here

179
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,880
i take the least significant bit and i

180
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,479
say it was a one and i change it to a

181
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,360
zero

182
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,039
you know that changes the color to this

183
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,400
it's not that much different so

184
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
it doesn't look particularly strange it

185
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,560
doesn't you know um

186
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,599
and so you get roughly about 1 8 the

187
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,120
size of the image

188
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,639
or that you're hiding in that you can

189
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,560
embed your data into

190
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,000
and in my case we embedded various types

191
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,319
of malware

192
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,840
so here we'll talk about the the

193
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,199
research i did with the university of

194
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:19,919
idaho

195
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,840
so um i i was really targeting these

196
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,160
opswat kiosks and so this is really

197
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,880
common

198
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,840
uh among the nuclear industry where i

199
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,960
have a lot of

200
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,280
uh experience in and so these were used

201
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
to scan the portable media that come in

202
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,080
and out of the

203
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,560
the facilities it's almost like a single

204
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,639
point of failure like anything that

205
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,840
uh is going to get used on a system via

206
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,840
like a laptop or a usb or something it

207
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,280
has to get scanned with these kiosks

208
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,840
right

209
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,680
and so if i put on my attacker hat and

210
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,199
i'm thinking about like okay

211
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,960
i've got some malware that i've gotta

212
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,560
put on there it's gonna get scanned by

213
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,479
this kiosk i have to be able to evade

214
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,680
this kiosk

215
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,800
and so so you know and and you have to

216
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,759
remember too that

217
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,199
the nuclear industry has done like

218
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,960
significant work to make it very

219
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,319
difficult to attack

220
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,080
these facilities right so they've

221
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,440
implemented like

222
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,120
uh data diodes which are like very

223
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,720
effective firewalls uh

224
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,400
you know they're one-way communication

225
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,240
so it really stops some of those kinds

226
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,199
of attacks

227
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,440
they do like wireless sweeps they've got

228
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,759
um validated suppliers and things to

229
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,599
help with the supply chain

230
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,759
attack vector you know their physical

231
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,879
security is

232
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,879
is through the roof and so really when

233
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,800
i'm looking at those like kind of

234
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,479
attack vectors i'm like okay the

235
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,919
portable media is the most

236
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,159
uh vulnerable at least in my mind maybe

237
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,320
supply chain but other than supply chain

238
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,679
portable media is like where i'm kind of

239
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,000
thinking of and uh and so i was like let

240
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,320
me

241
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,480
be able to evade that and so if you're

242
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,640
not familiar with these kiosks they they

243
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,279
have like anywhere between four and 64

244
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,440
antivirus engines

245
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,640
and they um they scan they scan the usb

246
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,920
from hour and then let you know

247
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,959
what's happening right and so uh so i

248
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,800
was like let me go ahead and try to see

249
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,839
if we can exploit that

250
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,440
okay and so what i did here is i took

251
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,200
the e-car test file and so if you're not

252
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
familiar with e-car it's uh

253
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,959
the european institute for computer

254
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,560
anti-virus research

255
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,800
and they came up with a file that

256
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,600
universally

257
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
other than malwarebytes for whatever

258
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
reason malwarebytes doesn't agree but

259
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,120
every other antivirus in the world says

260
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,720
this file is malicious even though it's

261
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,640
not and it's just you so you can test it

262
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,200
right

263
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,040
and so i took this file and i uh

264
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,720
so here's a little little bit about the

265
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
experiment here so i took this file and

266
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
i scanned it like just the normal ecar

267
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,480
test file and the opswatkios says yeah

268
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,000
hey that's infected and that's the

269
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,120
correct result

270
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,839
and so then i took the image and

271
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,680
embedded like uh

272
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,120
the e-card test file in it using

273
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,200
steganography and the result said no

274
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,720
there's nothing wrong with it it's

275
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,279
clearly fine right and then i scan just

276
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,800
the image without the thing in it and it

277
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,640
says it's clean right and so i do this

278
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,600
as well with

279
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,399
virus total so not just the kiosk and so

280
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,240
you can see that the the effect was the

281
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,600
same and so the problem isn't

282
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,320
necessarily

283
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,440
with uh with with with the kiosks

284
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,640
themselves but with the way that

285
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,399
antivirus software works the antivirus

286
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,320
software is not able to

287
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,600
accurately pick out this steganographic

288
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,480
files and so you can see here yeah it

289
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,360
does

290
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,120
it detects it when it's in its unhidden

291
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,399
state but when it's in its hidden state

292
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,640
it doesn't detect it

293
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,680
and so and then later while i was

294
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,240
uh working with dragos i was on a pen

295
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,000
test on a gas control network and

296
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,760
so here we were we're part of an overall

297
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,519
campaign right and so we're

298
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,800
we're going through our privilege

299
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,959
escalation and we're thinking like

300
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,240
okay we we have access here but we want

301
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,000
to we want to

302
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,680
we want to run something like mimi cats

303
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,440
but mimi cats is uh

304
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,959
is going to get blocked by the antivirus

305
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,640
so how are we going to get it across

306
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,200
there

307
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,880
and so i used a different kind of

308
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,480
oh and i guess i should have said that

309
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,160
before so the image secondography i used

310
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,560
for

311
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,360
opswa i used a tool called lsb stego

312
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,959
it's just a python library

313
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,920
and then for this one we used uh invoke

314
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,320
ps

315
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
image which is it's on github and you

316
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,839
can embed uh

317
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,160
powershell scripts inside of images and

318
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,399
then extract them via powershell with a

319
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,640
very simple one-line command so

320
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,399
uh it's very easy you don't have to

321
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,920
bring over another

322
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,279
script you don't have to bring over

323
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,880
another executable to extract the

324
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,399
payload you can just run this quick

325
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,399
one-liner in the in the powershell and

326
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,200
bring it out

327
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,040
and so we were able to do this on the

328
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,640
gas control network and then run

329
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,760
mimikatz and get

330
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,519
domain admin and so and then obviously

331
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,880
it wasn't you know it's a part of an

332
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,399
overall campaign you know because you

333
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,920
can see on the network drawing here i'm

334
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,680
running it from like an hmi

335
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,519
pretty deep into the environment so you

336
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,279
have to you know i'm not saying like

337
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,959
steganography is a silver

338
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,720
you know is an ultimate weapon and i can

339
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,320
from the outside it can somehow get

340
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,920
inside so no it's got to be part of an

341
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,440
overall campaign where you've

342
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,360
you've moved through or you've come in

343
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,720
through usb

344
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,639
you know so in that op slot scenario i'm

345
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,320
coming in usb but in this scenario we

346
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,639
came through pivoting across the network

347
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,000
progressively getting more and more

348
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,079
progressively getting more advanced into

349
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,040
the network until we

350
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,160
we have this thing

351
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,880
sorry about that and um

352
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,040
yeah and so you can see here

353
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,920
a couple of things that we used you can

354
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,160
see here i uploaded the image

355
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,720
to virustotal and none of the

356
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,760
antiviruses

357
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,560
picked up on it and so we were able to

358
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,839
extract it and run it

359
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,800
okay and so when we talk about okay so

360
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,320
is this a credible threat

361
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,760
uh you know cigarettography is very

362
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,920
niche thing you know antivirus isn't

363
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,880
detecting it

364
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,959
what can i do about it as an asset owner

365
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,000
is it something that i really

366
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,160
care about are people using it and so

367
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,600
this is a very valid question right

368
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,360
because it's very difficult to

369
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,959
like oh so now i've got to go buy

370
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,560
steganography detection software or

371
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,200
something

372
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,880
and that's not what i'm saying at all it

373
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,320
is a credible threat and you know

374
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,399
steganography can be used by adversaries

375
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,680
to evade

376
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,600
uh antivirus and network monitoring and

377
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,800
things like that

378
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,600
but um but defense is doable there are

379
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,920
very simple mitigations that can be done

380
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,320
and detections that that don't require

381
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,560
having sophisticated steganography

382
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,600
detection tools right

383
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,320
and so if you it could be very simple as

384
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,560
like

385
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,480
so you know if you look here as well so

386
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,399
we so at dragos we track

387
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,839
several uh threat activity groups and so

388
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,760
none of these uh ics based threat

389
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,519
activity groups have been shown to use

390
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,040
steganography so

391
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,279
so at this point i wouldn't rank

392
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,519
segregate as a very high threat

393
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,480
to the ot new world i just want to kind

394
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,000
of highlight that it's a possibility

395
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,519
that this could be used in an overall

396
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,839
campaign we've seen it in non-ics threat

397
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,720
campaigns

398
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,639
but uh not in ics related ones

399
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,720
i think i skipped yeah here it is i

400
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,240
skipped some slides here

401
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,079
um so like some of the best things that

402
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,360
you can do here

403
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,680
is so you know the op slot kiosk can be

404
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,440
configured to block images so when

405
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,880
you're thinking about it it's like

406
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,279
okay does my operational network does my

407
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,199
nuclear plant do i really need to load

408
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,680
images onto this plant what use case do

409
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,880
i have to have images

410
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,720
and so if i just block images that i

411
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,160
mean that stops like 90

412
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,680
of steganography and i don't even need

413
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,199
detection now

414
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,639
um you know and you know and

415
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,880
opswat can also do some some fancy

416
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,959
copying of the files over as well and so

417
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:35,920
if you look at

418
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,560
like compression so in some cases

419
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,240
compression can be used to

420
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,199
uh to remove forms of steganography it

421
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,199
depends if you use like a loss

422
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,199
a lossless compression or a lossy

423
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,279
compression so lossless it's not going

424
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,320
to break it but

425
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
lossy compression will will probably

426
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,240
break most of the payloads in there

427
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,519
and so and in most cases uh scripts or

428
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,199
executables or something is going to be

429
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,120
required to extract the malware from the

430
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,480
image or the other medium

431
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,240
so this is talking like powershell

432
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,839
python java and i

433
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,519
then it's harder for me as an attacker

434
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,839
to extract my payload and get it by

435
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,360
but in the case that we were at

436
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,440
powershell was not blocked

437
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,800
and so um

438
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,040
and so another point i have here is you

439
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,040
know just using like known good files in

440
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,320
your ot just like basic hygiene right so

441
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,920
if you're only introducing files that

442
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,360
you know are good

443
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,880
then you can prevent something like that

444
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,240
so i'm going to prevent scripts i'm

445
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,680
going to prevent images that i don't

446
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,279
have an explicit use for

447
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,880
like um and if you're looking for like

448
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,959
c2 kind of traffic so like in the case

449
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,560
of like malware that reaches out to a

450
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,120
server

451
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,199
and tries to extract malicious code via

452
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,639
an image download

453
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,240
like you know the the code is hidden in

454
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,800
the an image that's hosted externally

455
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,320
you can still see that traffic on your

456
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,680
network monitoring so you should say hey

457
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,360
let's strange i'm reaching out to a new

458
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,079
website

459
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,199
you know it's like oh i'm reaching out

460
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,560
to the website downloading an image that

461
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,920
might not be strange but the fact that

462
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,519
it's a new website from like an

463
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,519
hmi that's really interesting and i

464
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,519
would certainly want an alert on that

465
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,440
um there are also there are endpoint

466
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,680
tools you can get that are

467
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,560
detectorgraphy i wouldn't say you need

468
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
to go put them out there

469
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
um there are lots of other like basic

470
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,759
hygiene things you can do instead but

471
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,360
there are tools like stag detect and

472
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,759
stag

473
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,519
expose and stego hunt and things like

474
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,199
that that can detect some of these types

475
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,320
of files

476
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,120
and so like if i was building detections

477
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,800
in i would say yeah i want

478
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,959
alerts anytime somebody's running like a

479
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,880
powershell script a perl script

480
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,040
uh python things like that um

481
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,399
you know there's also the option here i

482
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,399
have passive analysis you could if you

483
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,000
if you're capturing network traffic you

484
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,759
could um

485
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,000
you know extract files out of pcapps and

486
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,440
then load them into like

487
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,759
endpoint tools like stego detect or 700

488
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,279
something like that to try to identify

489
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:47,519
it

490
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,040
and in that case i would really only see

491
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,399
that if you're kind of like in the

492
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,680
incident response like something's

493
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,240
happened

494
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,000
and then you're responding to it and

495
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,360
they're like well i've got these ptap

496
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,800
coverage let's look and see what what

497
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,839
the actual instructions were

498
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,119
oops sorry about that

499
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,799
i can't seem to switch my slide okay

500
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,640
so so in the end here i just kind of

501
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
want to summarize by saying you know

502
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,039
it can be used for adversaries to evade

503
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,160
defenses

504
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,319
um you know and that and that's then

505
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,679
that can be kind of scary however

506
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,520
defense is very doable you don't have to

507
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,240
come it's

508
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,160
you know this isn't a zero day this

509
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,000
isn't something everyone should go

510
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,919
freak out and worry about but it's

511
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:28,960
something they should think about and

512
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,559
it's another reason to do some very

513
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,400
basic hygiene things like think about

514
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,919
files before you put them on your

515
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,280
operational network

516
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
uh you know should i do like integrity

517
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,600
checks and hashing and things like that

518
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,679
and so i just wanted to highlight this

519
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,760
this niche evasion technique

520
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,440
not because i wanted to scare people but

521
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,840
just sort of like an awareness right

522
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,880
and um and it's it is a little scary

523
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,480
because it's very easy to use the tools

524
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,520
are free they're out there on the

525
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,360
internet they're very easy to use

526
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,200
and they bypass most traditional

527
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,440
protections and detection mechanisms

528
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
so it's just something to think about

529
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,679
and i you know and i was able to use it

530
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,760
in just a real life scenario fairly

531
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,840
easily

532
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,679
and and with that that's the end of my

533
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,760
presentation i can take any questions

534
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,200
i'm not sure if there's time because we

535
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,880
kind of started late on one but let's

536
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,480
one question um the hacking lab

537
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,280
asks with things being shared on teams

538
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,600
and sharepoint is there a worry or

539
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,679
anything regarding height uh regarding

540
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,520
hiding some type of payload in a meme

541
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,720
i mean certainly right uh so memes are

542
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,559
like uh

543
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,120
uh are a treasure trove of hiding things

544
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,160
like that was i

545
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,600
i don't remember all the details but

546
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
there was one

547
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,760
apt i remember reading about that like

548
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,520
they were getting their instructions by

549
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,039
looking like britney spears twitter

550
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,960
comments and like so they would just

551
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,559
like go through that and then that would

552
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,200
somehow

553
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
that would go back and getting their

554
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,880
their control but

555
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,039
um there's so many i've seen a lot of

556
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,720
like traversal issues with sharepoint

557
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,000
and i'm like almost worried about

558
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,080
exposing confidential data more so than

559
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,640
like

560
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,880
people hiding payloads on in in

561
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,039
sharepoint but it's totally

562
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,480
plausible and that's exactly what i'm

563
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,160
talking about you know you find a folder

564
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,600
full of like memes you're like oh okay

565
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
this person just likes to share memes

566
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,240
but then when you do some really deep

567
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,160
analysis you know you open a hex editor

568
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,600
or some of these tools like that you say

569
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,000
okay

570
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,280
actually they're hiding something in

571
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,120
here you know like there's all kinds of

572
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,440
statistical tests you can do

573
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,960
on the image colors and things to say

574
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,480
this is pretty likely that it's been

575
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,520
manipulated

576
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,120
and so you can look and say okay this is

577
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,600
this doesn't occur naturally this color

578
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,280
spectrum here like you can put them in

579
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,880
histograms and kind of see that

580
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,160
and you're like okay i'm suspecting that

581
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
they're hiding data and i i want to kind

582
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,520
of look and see what kind of algorithm

583
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,960
it might be and i could reverse it you

584
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,400
can't always reverse it but a lot of

585
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
times you can't extract the payloads out

586
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,440
especially if they use a very simple um

587
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,400
uh simple embedding link like uh like

588
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,840
least significant bent that's very easy

589
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,280
to rip something out but if they do like

590
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,480
a random one then

591
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,919
it's a little harder to rip out but then

592
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,760
it's easier to tell because then

593
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,600
you start getting weird colors all over

594
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
the image and things like that so

595
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,080
hopefully that answer your question uh

596
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,679
we have a question from discord can you

597
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,080
embed payloads by modifying colors in

598
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,600
all types of images or does this

599
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,280
technique only work for certain file

600
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,120
formats

601
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,039
that is a great question i i feel bad

602
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,559
that i didn't touch on that

603
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,919
you can technically do this in all file

604
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,440
formats however uh some

605
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,520
file formats limit themselves better to

606
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,039
payloads than others

607
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,440
so jpegs are very compressed and so that

608
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,480
would be

609
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,080
usually a poor choice for hiding it

610
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,600
unless the thing that you're hiding is

611
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,559
very small

612
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,799
now you look at like png files those are

613
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,320
very easy to hide things in and very

614
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,960
common

615
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,799
uh personally my favorite are like tiff

616
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,559
files like those really big

617
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,480
uh professional photography high

618
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,600
resolution uh

619
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,120
photo files because they're huge you can

620
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,880
hide anything in there and then uh you

621
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,320
know i didn't i only talked about image

622
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
steganography but you can actually

623
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,280
um there's like mp4 steganography right

624
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,679
so

625
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,360
it's not uncommon for like a uh

626
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,200
it's not uncommon for a uh

627
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,039
a blu-ray rip of like the dark knight to

628
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,960
be like 10 gigabytes in size

629
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,720
and you know so there are techniques you

630
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,880
can use to then hide a like a true crypt

631
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,080
or a veracrypt uh

632
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,760
file container inside of that and so

633
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,679
you've got this file on your

634
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,360
computer that like when you click it and

635
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,120
it plays it's uh

636
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,480
it's the dark knight but then when i

637
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
drag it over to veracrypt and type in a

638
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,360
long password

639
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,360
it actually opens up an encrypted file

640
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,799
container and it's got all my malicious

641
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,440
stuff in it

642
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,640
i mean there's all kinds of things you

643
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,480
can do and it's very difficult to detect

644
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,640
and of course you've got that randomness

645
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,400
protection the um

646
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,000
that you have with the veracrypt and

647
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,440
truecrypt

648
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,559
yeah thanks good question and final

649
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,679
question because this is really all

650
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,039
we've got time for uh is there a

651
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,480
one-stop shop scanner

652
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,360
tool for stag

653
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,880
honestly probably not

654
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,799
so i used to work on some steganography

655
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,640
tools uh back in the day

656
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,799
uh and and so there's some i have a

657
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,640
pretty good idea of like

658
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,320
most of them out there detect just

659
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,679
images now

660
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,919
one that i used to work for a company

661
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,280
called whetstone

662
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,960
technologies they have a tool called

663
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
stego hunt that is probably

664
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
last time i did an evaluation it was

665
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,400
above and beyond like the other kind of

666
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,919
steganography tools it was

667
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,880
it would grab images videos audio files

668
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,360
and it was really good at it so

669
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,080
i i would suggest that but there are

670
