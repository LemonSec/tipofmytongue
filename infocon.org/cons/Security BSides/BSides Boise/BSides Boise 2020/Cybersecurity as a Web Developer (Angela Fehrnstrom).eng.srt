1
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,719
okay

2
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,119
now we're live uh i

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,439
i wasn't expecting this so this is a bit

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,160
of a bit of a scuff for me but um

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,000
yeah sorry about that uh

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,519
delay but uh here's

7
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,479
angela fernstrom with sub security as a

8
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,520
web developer

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:45,840
all yours

10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,240
this person and

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,600
i am getting feedback from someone um

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,640
there we go um

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,520
very cyber security and privacy

14
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,560
conscious person

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,080
and was learning a lot more through the

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,000
course of that relationship

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,560
um but my professor said the mentalities

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,159
just don't go together web devs want

19
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,920
everything as open as possible and then

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,280
security wants everything locked down

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,200
and closed

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,720
relationship didn't last but what did

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,799
last is the importance of cyber security

24
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,159
in my job

25
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,840
because in my opinion web development

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
and security not only can go together

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,280
but really should

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,520
so as a webmaster for what has quite

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,680
frankly been a lot of projects over the

30
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,560
years

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,799
i've always felt that part of my job is

32
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,759
to be at least

33
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,479
somewhat conscious of the security risks

34
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,079
and concerns for each individual

35
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,240
project sometimes those risks are a

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,119
little bit much

37
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,719
smaller they're things that just come

38
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,240
with having any kind of online presence

39
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,600
and then other times the risks are a

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,520
little bit more serious and it really

41
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,640
just varies

42
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,199
depending on the project most of my

43
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,440
career has centered around fields that

44
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,280
tend to be a little bit more security

45
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,599
sensitive than others might be

46
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,440
i've worked for the idaho department of

47
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,959
administration which

48
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,480
is now the office of information

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,800
technology services the idaho department

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,080
of finance and i now work for the

51
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,080
federal courts district of idaho

52
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,400
and then in my volunteer time i

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,480
typically end up creating websites

54
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,840
for youth or security organizations

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,519
this has included several girl scout

56
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,440
events b-sides boise

57
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,360
b-sides idaho and then also idaho

58
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,800
infraguard

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,480
so throughout this please keep in mind

60
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,959
i'm not a security professional

61
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,280
i am a web developer who is doing her

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,440
best to keep security a priority in her

63
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,519
life and her career

64
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,400
but i'm going to walk you through some

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,160
of the websites and projects that i've

66
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,879
worked with

67
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,560
in the past and i'm hoping that

68
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,319
with you seeing my thought process you

69
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,800
can kind of see what someone outside the

70
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
security community

71
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,720
sees as a risk how they implement what

72
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,080
sort of precautions they can

73
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,159
and maybe get a little bit of an insight

74
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,720
in how some of your devs might think

75
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,519
so first off let's take a look at some

76
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,720
of the projects

77
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,360
the first site is one that i'm pretty

78
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,280
certain you've all visited it's actually

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,440
the besides idaho website the event site

80
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,799
for this event

81
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,200
um security event websites that i've

82
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,280
created they all tend to have the goal

83
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,159
of conveying

84
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,159
information event information like the

85
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,239
time and place the event schedule

86
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,319
how to get tickets how to submit a talk

87
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,159
important links social media stuff

88
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,840
community resources just all that sort

89
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,120
of stuff

90
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,000
the idaho infraguard idaho website is

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,239
similar in a lot of ways

92
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,840
they want to convey information about

93
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,840
the organization how can you join how

94
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,920
can what are some current and upcoming

95
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,480
events what's contact information

96
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,480
links to those events and information

97
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,400
about the local board

98
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,480
so i've also worked on a lot of

99
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,400
government websites

100
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,159
part of my job at the department of

101
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,040
administration was to help agencies that

102
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,720
didn't have a web developer

103
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,080
create and manage their websites the

104
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,000
ones that i've worked on have primarily

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,079
been information repositories for the

106
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,440
public

107
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,279
these websites share information about

108
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,040
the agency like what

109
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,800
they regulate which can sometimes be

110
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,520
confusing they have contact information

111
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,120
sometimes they have laws rulings and

112
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,759
regulations that the agencies control

113
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,759
sometimes the agencies share licensing

114
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,360
information and requirements they have

115
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
legal decisions fees and fines industry

116
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,280
news stuff like that

117
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,040
and then now working at the federal

118
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,919
courts we also have information about

119
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:44,639
our judges

120
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,720
we have information for lawyers if you

121
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,080
get a jury duty notice we have

122
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,759
information about that

123
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,080
orders and rules and then also because

124
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,160
of the way the idaho district court is

125
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,840
structured we actually have probation

126
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,000
and pre-trial services information as

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,120
well

128
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,520
so then covet starts and government

129
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,400
websites

130
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,880
have a ton of extra contact information

131
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,560
they have extra forms they've got

132
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,000
information about if the physical

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,400
location is open or closed

134
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,479
allowing more online submissions of

135
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,639
forms sometimes agencies have

136
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,400
implemented online chats

137
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,479
and just across the board it's been a

138
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,080
ton more

139
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,440
traffic and then the last thing that i

140
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,120
want to look at with you guys

141
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,520
is a couple of girl scout websites the

142
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,120
first one it's pretty similar to the

143
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,080
b-sides idaho

144
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,000
site it's an event site event

145
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,680
information registration form

146
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,000
done the other one though um

147
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,600
this is a site for an event that

148
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,759
averages 1500 people

149
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,680
and when we initially talked about the

150
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,400
website the requirements had

151
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,320
processing and storing of health

152
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,479
histories medication info

153
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,479
full contact info which includes phone

154
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,000
number email address and physical

155
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,800
address

156
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,759
emergency contact information birthdays

157
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,639
grade levels

158
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,400
driver's licenses which is both the

159
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,319
driver's license number and a scan of

160
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,199
the card

161
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,680
car insurance info information uh girl

162
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,759
scout id numbers and then on top of all

163
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,720
of that

164
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,160
we're supposed to be processing credit

165
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,400
card payments that one's going to be a

166
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,759
mess

167
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,919
so i'm sure you guys are picking up on

168
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,199
some of the risks that

169
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,639
i did but i want to show you what i

170
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,120
picked up on when i

171
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,440
start working on these projects so first

172
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,680
up the security sites

173
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,319
security industry websites they have a

174
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,440
reputation of being

175
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,479
tested as a good word for it a few years

176
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,000
ago some of the infragard chapter

177
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,759
websites were actually targeted in a

178
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,720
series of attacks by hacktivists

179
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,800
the and then the infraguard site also

180
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,199
kind of has an extra layer of

181
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,199
risk because that falls into both

182
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,840
security and government website

183
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,240
categories

184
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,000
as infraguard is a public-private

185
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,400
partnership with the fbi

186
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,759
on the topic of government websites

187
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,960
there always a target like always

188
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,039
some of the government website specific

189
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,720
risks that i've personally seen

190
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,880
are being defaced denial of service

191
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,759
attacks and

192
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,680
accidentally posting non-public

193
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,479
information which is also a fun one

194
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,560
of course there's a ton of other risks

195
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,080
and government sites aren't the only

196
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,319
ones with these risks this is just in my

197
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,840
experience

198
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,680
one of the worst fears of a government

199
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
agency is ending up on the news

200
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,880
and any one of those will get you there

201
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,759
almost immediately so that's a problem

202
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,440
then lastly the one that i'm sure you

203
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,880
guys are all cringing over

204
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,720
is that girl scout website that first

205
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,919
one

206
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,599
i'm not as worried about registration

207
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,039
form was on another site

208
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,919
it wasn't actually any input on my site

209
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,360
i'm also not quite as worried about

210
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,039
these sites being hacked into or defaced

211
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,280
as i might be for government site or

212
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,479
the security industry stuff

213
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,840
the other website though that big

214
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,879
website that one touches on some of my

215
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,639
absolute deepest fears as a web

216
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,759
developer

217
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,599
we're not collecting any analytics so we

218
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,520
don't have to worry i'm not as worried

219
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,759
as much about kappa but we are dealing a

220
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,879
lot with hipaa

221
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,160
pci pii laws and it's for kids

222
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,639
so the site is going to process a ton of

223
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,039
information for over a thousand miners

224
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,800
plus all of the adult volunteers that

225
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,240
are involved

226
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,680
and then on top of that when i'm working

227
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,520
on a girl scout website one thing that i

228
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,800
am always worried about

229
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,840
it um are predators and then posting too

230
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,759
much information about the event photos

231
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
that are being shared to promote the

232
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,759
event

233
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,000
again not only is this straying really

234
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,160
really far into regulatory waters and

235
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,440
privacy issues

236
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,320
these are kids that we're worrying about

237
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,640
so

238
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
as a web developer how do i deal with

239
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
these issues

240
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,880
for the simpler sites like the security

241
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,399
sites and that first event website for

242
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,200
girl scouts

243
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,919
one of my go-to methods of sort of

244
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,279
securing the site

245
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,760
is just making it as flat as possible

246
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,519
i've been told that this could be called

247
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,120
security through simplicity

248
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,480
i don't know if that's real term but i

249
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,080
like it and i'm keeping it so i'm using

250
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,800
it

251
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,440
um i obfuscate email addresses i

252
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,880
sanitize the form input if the

253
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,800
organization insists on having one

254
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,200
stuff like that again if we use the b

255
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,279
sites idaho site as an example that site

256
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,600
is

257
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,399
all html css and javascript there's no

258
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,399
input from the users

259
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,560
the page is put together on the server

260
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,920
it's sent to your browser

261
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,760
css makes it look pretty javascript

262
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,279
makes it do fancy things because i'm

263
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,800
using bootstrap

264
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,839
that's it it's not a perfect website

265
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,279
it's not the most interactive it's not

266
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,200
the most amazing or groundbreaking thing

267
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,640
you've ever visited

268
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,800
but a simple flat website is exactly

269
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,880
what we needed for the event so that's

270
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,640
what i delivered and that tends to be

271
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,000
the case for most events that i've

272
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,399
worked with

273
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,279
when working on a government website i

274
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,640
thankfully have

275
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,080
other teams that i can work with and

276
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,399
lean on i have worked

277
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,080
i work with the security team server

278
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,519
team networking teams

279
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,120
to make sure that the infrastructure in

280
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,080
and of itself is secure to begin with

281
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,680
and then on top of that i have to do my

282
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,360
job so in one instance

283
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,040
as part of the web team we were dealing

284
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,120
with a denial of service attack

285
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,959
the solution that we came up with was to

286
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,120
set up the system to dump requests from

287
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,079
a given ip

288
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,600
if they sent too many requests in a

289
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,360
certain amount of time

290
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
other times the server team has sent

291
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,800
through an urgent update that we need to

292
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
install like right now

293
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,200
we've also set up alerts for suspicious

294
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,160
activity

295
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
and we can configure that to be sent to

296
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,320
specific teams if needed

297
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,079
for example one of the agencies that

298
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,240
i've worked with they send an email to

299
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,160
the security team if an ip gets a

300
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,600
certain number of errors in a given

301
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,000
amount of time

302
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,680
so in addition to working with other

303
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
teams i have to make sure that i'm

304
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,079
following secure coding practices

305
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,399
again go to method of this is kind of a

306
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,720
simple flat site that i mentioned before

307
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,800
offers fewer attack vectors harder to

308
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,480
get into stuff like that

309
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,640
but honestly in today's world that's not

310
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,240
always an option

311
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
especially with everyone interacting

312
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,680
with everything online

313
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,240
so stuff like sanitizing form input

314
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,079
training end users making sure patches

315
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,920
and updates are always installed

316
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,600
up and up to date those things all

317
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,120
become very important

318
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,920
government also has an added kind of

319
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,560
risk

320
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,720
of is this really for public consumption

321
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,640
that's a problem um to mitigate this

322
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,040
i will usually double check everything

323
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,959
that someone sends to me to post

324
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,480
i'll check with my manager i'll check

325
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,320
double check with the person hey are we

326
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,760
sure this needs to be posted

327
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,959
but really that's something that

328
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,200
shouldn't be only on me as the developer

329
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,880
that needs to be a cultural and training

330
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,760
thing in the agency

331
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,959
and then we're going to look at that

332
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,959
girl scout website so

333
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,360
pretty sure you can understand why i was

334
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,079
like nope

335
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,800
i'm not doing this those requirements

336
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,240
are way too much

337
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,360
i don't want to mess with hipaa pci pii

338
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,760
this hits all three of those

339
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,959
and i'm not avoiding them to hide what

340
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:49,760
i'm doing

341
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,279
and it's not necessarily because i'm

342
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,200
afraid of them it's because i don't know

343
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,320
how to do them

344
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,320
right all i know is enough to know that

345
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,360
these things are an issue this is a

346
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,399
volunteer group

347
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,920
we don't have the funds to hire a

348
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,760
security professional who does know how

349
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,000
to do these things right

350
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,040
and honestly that's a lot of work so the

351
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,399
first thing that

352
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,360
we looked at is assess the need of the

353
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,920
site

354
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,079
do we really need to be collecting all

355
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,040
of that information

356
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,680
and unfortunately the answer was yes the

357
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,480
only thing

358
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,320
that we could actually remove from that

359
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,600
list of requirements

360
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,480
was the mailing address so what do we do

361
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,680
now

362
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,320
we outsourced so first thing we did was

363
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,079
we found a service that actually

364
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,440
specializes

365
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,399
in excuse me in youth camp health

366
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,399
histories

367
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,880
literally all they do that's their thing

368
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,240
so what we're going to do is we're going

369
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,839
to direct the girls and the adults to

370
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:46,720
their site

371
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,800
to complete the health histories and

372
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,480
then as we've been working with the

373
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,760
service we were actually able to

374
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,880
customize

375
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,360
the forms that we give to the adults to

376
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,959
accept the driver's licenses car

377
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,320
insurance information that we need

378
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,079
this company they've got security in

379
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,519
place they know what they're doing they

380
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,120
have their hipaa stuff figured out this

381
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,279
is what they do

382
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,920
so we don't have to worry about that as

383
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,200
much

384
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,440
also from a more physical security

385
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,800
standpoint

386
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,560
having everything in a really organized

387
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,120
easy to access location for our nurse

388
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,880
on site is going to be really helpful as

389
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,240
well

390
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,720
the next thing we looked at was payment

391
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,320
there's a little bit of wonkiness with

392
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,120
how girl scout

393
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,279
rewards works that means we can't just

394
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,959
like automatically send them to

395
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,639
a payment page um so we were having a

396
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,079
little bit of trouble with that but the

397
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,279
solution that we came to

398
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,800
was we will be creating paypal invoices

399
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
closer to the event for the remainder of

400
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,839
the balance

401
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,399
and then that invoice will direct them

402
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,000
to paypal's website where they can

403
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,040
pay the invoice with a card again

404
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,240
paypal has pci figured out they have

405
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,040
security in place they know their stuff

406
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,959
last thing is the pii

407
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,199
we can't get around needing all of that

408
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,120
information because

409
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
running a huge event like that we need

410
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,880
information

411
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,800
but what we can do is avoid storing it

412
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,639
on with the website

413
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,680
so if we figured out that if we collect

414
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,360
just the name and the girl scout id we

415
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,680
can actually cross-reference that with

416
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,040
the information that we get from our

417
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,720
council office

418
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,920
get the data that we need like the

419
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,680
birthdays the grade level stuff like

420
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,240
that

421
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,360
and then we can actually store that

422
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,279
offline so

423
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,680
just by addressing the scope of the site

424
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,120
we were able to eliminate

425
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,639
almost everything that i was worried

426
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,600
about still have a lot of information

427
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,079
we still have a lot of input to sanitize

428
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,519
but at least we're now at a point that

429
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,279
i'm not having nightmares about being

430
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,000
the cause of a hipaa or pci breach and

431
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,320
pii is no longer stored someplace that's

432
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,920
easily accessible

433
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,839
online so girl scouts again along with

434
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:52,240
those

435
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,320
issues i do have to worry about how much

436
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,079
is being shared

437
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,839
girl scout sites they're not necessarily

438
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,680
hidden they're not like password

439
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,360
protected and stuff like that

440
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,120
but they're also not promoted i don't do

441
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,120
any seo work on them i don't submit them

442
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,360
to google i don't do anything like that

443
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
most of these sites they can really only

444
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,480
be found

445
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,160
if you follow the links directly from

446
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,920
the council website or the newsletters

447
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,839
that they only send to registered girls

448
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,440
and adults we are very careful about

449
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,959
what information we share about the

450
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:21,519
event

451
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,760
and the only photos of girls if there

452
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,199
are any i have done several events

453
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,120
but there are no photos of girls shared

454
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,720
on the website

455
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,639
are ones that we know have signed photo

456
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,240
release forms and the parents are okay

457
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,199
with it

458
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,560
um last names never shared and often

459
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,639
we use camp names or nicknames instead

460
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,199
of the first names so it's again

461
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,240
a little bit yeah um

462
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,480
this is an instance that honestly i feel

463
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,320
like just the mere existence

464
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,600
of having a website makes a risk and so

465
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,279
we can't be perfect but what we can do

466
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,720
is just absolutely everything we

467
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,560
possibly can to protect the girls and

468
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,639
their data

469
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,519
so ultimately what my professor said it

470
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,440
indicated to me as a student

471
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
a level of animosity between the web

472
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,199
development and security industries but

473
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,160
i've never actually encountered that

474
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,839
some of the web developers that i've

475
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,519
worked with have actually been some of

476
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,440
the most security conscious people i've

477
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,759
met outside of the security industry

478
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,519
which going off what my professor was

479
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,120
saying would be a big surprise

480
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,839
at some level all of us as web

481
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,680
developers are very aware of the fact

482
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,800
that

483
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,199
honestly of all the i.t positions we're

484
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,040
one of the ones with the most public

485
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,399
facing contact

486
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,160
but everything that i've seen and all of

487
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,920
the web developers i've met indicates to

488
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,160
me that we want to help you

489
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,759
we don't want to make your job harder we

490
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,000
just don't know how to help and that's

491
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,440
really where you can come in as a

492
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,279
security professional work with your

493
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,120
developers to assess what's actually

494
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,600
needed for functionality of the site

495
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,519
help your developers understand why

496
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,199
something might be a risk because you

497
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,120
might see a risk that we are like why is

498
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,120
that a problem

499
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,600
um also another thing that i've noticed

500
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,040
is we're often all

501
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,679
not up to date on the latest security

502
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,640
news

503
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,439
so i'm subscribed to a couple of cyber

504
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,119
security newsletters i've got several

505
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,919
friends in the cyber security community

506
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,319
i often receive news about security

507
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,119
risks from

508
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,959
them instead of the web development

509
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,280
newsletters that i'm subscribed to

510
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,919
that's news about urgent security

511
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,599
updates for a content management system

512
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:25,919
like

513
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,440
wordpress or drupal or joomla

514
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,320
hosting platform breaches other website

515
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,160
web related security news

516
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,960
that can come from my security contacts

517
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,280
as much as two days before my web

518
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,520
industry sources

519
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,360
so really just letting your developer

520
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,600
know as soon as you hear about something

521
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,440
can really be helpful because if you're

522
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,520
frustrated that they're not jumping on

523
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,200
something that was just announced

524
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,200
they might not even know about it yet um

525
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,160
so i've been told that then this is an

526
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,679
actual quote i can't remember who said

527
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,880
it but

528
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,720
i've been told i know more about cyber

529
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,640
security than any web developer has a

530
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,160
right to know

531
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,280
honestly i don't think that should be a

532
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,080
bad thing um because a security

533
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,960
conscious

534
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,799
developer is actually going to make your

535
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,640
life as a security professional much

536
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,679
easier

537
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,880
so and that is

538
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,440
what i have

539
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,320
let me just move this over here so i can

540
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,919
actually speak again

541
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,360
so far do we have any there are um

542
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,400
questions uh hang on

543
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,039


544
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,240
mute unmuting myself on zoom would be a

545
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,679
really good idea

546
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,480
uh yes there are some questions uh what

547
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,240
are your thoughts on website builders

548
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,919
such as wordpress and do they ship with

549
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,160
good and or bad security out of the box

550
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,640
i would say that if you don't really

551
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,919
know what you're doing something out of

552
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:56,880
the box like that

553
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,080
is better than trying to figure it out

554
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,559
it's a little bit easier

555
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,760
security wise wordpress is always

556
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,080
always in the news for something

557
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,400
some sort of attack some sort of

558
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,480
security issue that they have so

559
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,919
if you are going to use something like

560
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,440
that just make sure you are as

561
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,799
absolutely up to date on

562
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,160
all patches as possible

563
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,679
and considering how frequently they

564
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,880
release them ain't that the truth

565
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,480
yeah it seems like almost daily

566
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,039
sometimes it really does it really does

567
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,240
um one of my jobs is a webmaster and i

568
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,520
it's wordpress based and i see them all

569
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,000
the time

570
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,360
here's an update he's not that he's an

571
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
update yeah

572
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,120
uh another question do you think cyber

573
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,799
security concepts ought to be taught

574
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,760
or required uh more for developers

575
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,840
either formally or as part of continuing

576
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,000
education

577
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,679
i honestly i think it's important for

578
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,320
everyone um not just developers

579
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
even just you know anyone going through

580
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,799
anything i think security is really

581
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,919
really important um

582
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,840
but yeah as a developer i do think that

583
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,360
it's something that

584
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,679
should at least have concepts talked

585
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,080
about in class in

586
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,840
um whatever training you're going to

587
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,520
because it's right now it's such a

588
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,280
drastic there's such a divide between

589
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,480
the worlds like

590
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,320
when i was in school we never talked

591
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,600
about security stuff

592
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,760
except for because i knew people in the

593
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,640
industry

594
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,480
um and i i really do think that that's

595
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,840
something that should be

596
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,480
brought in more and addressed for

597
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,679
everyone but yes for

598
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,360
developers included i tend to agree with

599
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,480
that one

600
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,799
uh that looks like it for questions

601
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,480
so that's uh that's gonna be us

602
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,600
uh thank you for your time that's

603
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,640
appreciated and i

604
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,799
gotta click this button over here
