1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,199
all right

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,120
and we are live and we are live

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,080
with mr mark stacy on joining building

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,800
and scaling

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,840
a fully remote team welcome sir

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,920
it is all yours thank you

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,920
i should be able to see the slides if

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,760
someone could confirm in the discord

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,240
chat but even without video or

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,039
slides we should be able to have a

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,359
conversation about it so

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,120
uh jumping in uh we are

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,399
not short at all on materials or working

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,760
remotely

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,320
uh kobed certainly escalated a lot of

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,680
that where

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,280
there are multiple uh blogs and

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,760
uh you know presentations and books

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,280
written about working remotely and the

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,559
impacts of covid

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,600
there's also a lot of good material uh

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,280
if you guys can't see my screen i'll

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,719
just say it scaling teams

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,520
by alexander gross and david uh

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,280
loftus-ness

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,200
a great book but there's a lot of

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,640
material out there on

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,760
building and really scaling a team as

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,159
well

30
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,680
and so i'm not looking to replace any of

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,720
that great material

32
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,920
more so add to it and really identify

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,400
my own kind of lessons learned i've been

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,960
working remotely for

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,400
about uh 10 years uh my wife has been

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,600
working remotely for

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,119
six years so it's really good that we

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,880
get along as well as we do

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,240
and uh i recently joined dragos and when

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,840
i joined i was the

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,880
i think the 13th or 14th employee that

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,600
was

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,079
three years ago and we just hit over 200

44
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:44,960
people

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,320
so trying to bring the lesson uh lessons

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,759
learned that i've learned through that

47
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,479
process

48
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,200
here so first couple notes on building

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,399
a couple initial kind of uh

50
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,840
advisory topics generally

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,759
when we talk about a small team or

52
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,520
building a capability we're looking to

53
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,160
start with proven experience you're

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,520
looking for

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,760
specifically people that can identify

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,280
future issues

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,400
and then build a process around that to

58
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,200
event

59
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,680
prevent future heroics and that is

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,520
incredibly important

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,280
because you're doing the work while

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,280
you're building the future processes

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,080
that others

64
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,599
will do that requires not just

65
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,720
motivation but a certain level of

66
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,239
professionalism

67
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,959
specifically what i look for is if

68
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,959
people are able to remove

69
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,480
themselves from the deliverable focus on

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,360
what the client

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,760
needs uh so that the future growth of

72
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
the company is not based on what one

73
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,200
person wanted but

74
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,040
based on what what the clientele asked

75
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,400
for and so really the the old uh

76
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,160
kind of stereotype message of building

77
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,000
the plane while it's in flight

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,239
certainly rings true you want to start

79
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,840
with those kind of senior principal

80
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,400
level folks and build it from there

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,440
uh understanding that these people will

82
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,840
also be really setting the culture for

83
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,800
the company

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,920
uh so jumping down kind of the first uh

85
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,480
red block let's start with diversity and

86
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,400
that translates to

87
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,120
really establishing culture it's very

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,599
easy

89
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,480
for a company to build a culture

90
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,799
organically based on region or some of

91
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:27,280
the first

92
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,480
employees that come in and so really

93
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,239
starting with diversity and making sure

94
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,760
that it is based on

95
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,000
uh really the the company tenants that

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,239
we'll talk about as well and not

97
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,040
a region or group is important and

98
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,400
things like holidays

99
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,599
uh vernacular slaying sayings all of

100
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,720
those

101
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,159
are really based on that so next item

102
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,439
uh building tenants we use

103
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,760
another good book i'd recommend the five

104
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,439
dysfunctions of a team

105
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,080
very quick read we used that book to

106
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,560
build

107
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,959
tenants for our team and then we

108
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,200
trickled those throughout the company

109
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,879
and where those really come in useful

110
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,239
using an example where i had one

111
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,000
employee come and he was complaining

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,439
about another employee

113
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,519
i kind of had that second employee come

114
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,600
and he was complaining about the

115
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,639
the original employee and certainly

116
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,160
whenever you have disagreements hey

117
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,240
can hear me set up yeah i can hear you i

118
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,290
just can't like meeting

119
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,350
[Music]

120
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,280
but i think what that does is builds a

121
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,560
culture around

122
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,600
potentially unnecessary escalation and

123
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,160
so instead that's where we could use the

124
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,120
tenants

125
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,759
at dre ghost's their open candid

126
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,720
transparent

127
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,360
and honest conversation and so my advice

128
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,280
to both employees was

129
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,759
set up a meeting and started by saying

130
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,639
i'm going to have an

131
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,120
open candid conversation i'm removing

132
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,560
myself let's

133
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,360
focus on the output to the client and be

134
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,120
transparent about what is working and

135
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,160
what isn't

136
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,960
and then the culture is when you have a

137
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,680
conflict

138
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,600
address it directly with the person and

139
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,479
be open be candid but be professional

140
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,560
and so the tenants are incredibly

141
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,080
important

142
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,199
of course manage media and by that we're

143
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,320
not short on

144
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,520
slack skype zoom

145
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,680
any other type of electronic

146
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,199
conferencing out there

147
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,560
but managing it is important uh we

148
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,039
in the early days of of dragos our team

149
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,800
always turned on the video

150
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,400
if you have a five minute conversation

151
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,000
turn on the video and

152
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
we kind of i think i saw someone else

153
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,759
mention uh we got to be known as the

154
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,000
brady bunch because everyone would have

155
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,199
their video uh array set up

156
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,639
but that propagated throughout the

157
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,880
entire company and it's especially

158
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,479
important now when we hear

159
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,280
uh you know 70 to 90 percent of

160
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,440
communication as non-verbal

161
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,360
seeing facial expressions whether or not

162
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,160
you fold your arms or lean into the

163
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,280
conversation conversation

164
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,360
all that matters and it matters when

165
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,120
you're scaling a team and growing a lot

166
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,039
of people quickly

167
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,000
uh people don't understand sarcasm in

168
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,759
written words on slack

169
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,199
and so if you're going to have a quick

170
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,759
conversation it may be easy to do it in

171
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,560
text

172
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,199
but set up a quick video call make it

173
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,319
easy so that people

174
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,160
understand a name with a face and and

175
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,919
they can kind of build that rapport in

176
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,600
that baseline because

177
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,759
with covet they may not get it for uh

178
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,960
another couple years

179
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,000
um one caution because

180
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,199
you're hiring people quickly nobody gets

181
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,199
excited about the term middle management

182
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:39,600
but

183
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,120
it is important and mostly i i say

184
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,240
organizing as a requirement because

185
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,120
you've got

186
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,199
all of these principal senior people

187
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,199
that are running full speed

188
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,479
and the fastest uh path to frustration

189
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,759
that i've seen

190
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,400
is either duplication and work or

191
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,199
people's

192
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,160
output not being used and so getting on

193
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,400
a call and having someone say

194
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,280
i'm building this capability over here

195
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
and someone else on the team says i

196
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,479
already built that capability four

197
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,680
months ago

198
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,039
that's what you want to avoid and i

199
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,720
think really that

200
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,000
certainly a better term but the

201
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,560
organization or the middle management

202
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,240
really their job is to make sure that

203
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,000
the priorities are understood and that

204
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,560
we're not

205
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,479
doing those two specific uh

206
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,479
issues or pitfalls on the

207
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,199
joining side a couple quick notes to

208
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,479
those joining

209
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,120
teams that are growing quickly uh

210
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,280
certainly identify the team's culture

211
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,160
but bring your own style it goes back to

212
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,639
the

213
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,560
the diversity concept i mean

214
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,240
bring in your knowledge but bring in

215
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
your own style your own communication

216
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,080
style your likes and dislikes and really

217
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,520
contribute to the team

218
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,319
life pro tip that seems straightforward

219
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:58,800
but i

220
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,319
i can't overstate it enough when you are

221
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,080
setting up a meeting or scheduling

222
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,759
something

223
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,919
don't be naive to the impact of time

224
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,360
zones and match

225
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,599
those to the person you're scheduling it

226
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,800
with

227
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,879
if i'm setting up a meeting with someone

228
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,639
on the east coast and i propose

229
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,039
time i'm not just going to say 10 a.m

230
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,759
i'm going to say 10 a.m eastern time

231
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,400
or identify my targets area

232
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,240
that is i think a a very simple

233
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,840
thing that we could all improve on and

234
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,679
it really again kind of references back

235
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,719
to that profession

236
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,279
uh professionalism or experience working

237
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,559
remotely

238
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,919
uh also the ability to be

239
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,200
agile and have some adaptability be able

240
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,240
to understand

241
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,959
ambiguity in the workplace is incredibly

242
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:49,920
important

243
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,519
you may be hired to do one job

244
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,440
and the team is growing so quickly you

245
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,000
could add a proficiency or contribute in

246
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,920
another area and you may be asked to do

247
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,120
that as well

248
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,560
and that's okay the adage of

249
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,480
that's not what i was hired to do

250
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,000
doesn't fit in very well

251
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,120
with a lot of rapidly growing teams and

252
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,680
so go in with that and see it as

253
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,600
an exciting thing uh i

254
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,480
under the the kind of cautions the the

255
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,080
red blocks

256
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,279
the two main cautions i would have is

257
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,399
uh in the work life balance working

258
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,200
remotely

259
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
everybody wants it but people don't

260
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,959
really understand the impacts

261
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,360
regardless if your kids if you have them

262
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,080
are crying

263
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,600
or laughing you want to be out there

264
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,480
and the adage of always being available

265
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,080
certainly exists

266
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,000
when i worked at doe i remember we were

267
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,720
moving to

268
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,000
a day remote work and it was to save

269
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,200
money on heating

270
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,120
and lighting for the building and

271
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,480
management said

272
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,040
you know quote management said well it

273
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,080
can't be monday

274
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,600
because people just turn it into a

275
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,920
three-day weekend and it can't be friday

276
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,640
because of

277
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,440
of the same reason so tuesday wednesday

278
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,640
thursday

279
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,880
and i just candidly thought putting

280
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,240
bounds around it like that

281
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,480
is ridiculous we're not treating

282
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,800
employees like professionals

283
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,959
and in every study that has come out in

284
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,800
the past 10 years that i've read

285
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,959
people end up working more when they

286
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,160
work remotely

287
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,600
because your work is always there and

288
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,240
in a remote team it's very very true

289
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,800
where

290
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,519
especially international you sit down to

291
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,000
dinner

292
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,240
that may be the middle of the working

293
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,920
day for australia

294
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,000
or europe and so when you join a team

295
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,839
anytime you open slack or anything

296
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,360
you're going to see a question some

297
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,079
opportunity

298
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,240
to contribute oh great i know the answer

299
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,839
to that you run down to your computer

300
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,040
and then you're down there for three

301
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,880
hours and so

302
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,920
the understanding that you have to leave

303
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,079
work and where to put those separation

304
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,040
points in

305
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,279
i think is certainly something to

306
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,320
consider

307
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,760
a couple quick notes on interviewing

308
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,920
i may come back to these if if there's

309
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,200
time

310
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,880
but essentially do some research

311
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,440
understand the culture of the company

312
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,959
understand that as you

313
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,959
hire quickly that culture will be

314
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,160
stressed

315
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,800
they're not looking to uh to put hard

316
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,320
bounds around it but maintain the

317
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,680
culture while growing it

318
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,800
while adapting to what you you bring in

319
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,560
so i'll jump over to scaling and then

320
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,399
come back to the the blue bars

321
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,680
here if we have time on the the scaling

322
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,720
front

323
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,320
i'll use uh what i do at drago's now as

324
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,040
an example because it's it's very fresh

325
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,839
and that is

326
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,200
uh setting baselines i think is critical

327
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,880
to identify

328
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,920
what success looks like we have

329
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,680
uh say three principal consultants and

330
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,480
all of them do

331
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,920
a pen test based on their own experience

332
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,360
and all three of them you could

333
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
arguably say we're very successful

334
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,600
client was very very pleased

335
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,279
where that comes to be kind of a stress

336
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,800
point is when we scale

337
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,560
and i hire maybe a more junior employee

338
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,880
if he does a pen test with all three of

339
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,600
those

340
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
principal analysts he'll get three

341
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,040
different viewpoints

342
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,120
sure maybe that's good from an

343
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,959
experience standpoint but

344
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,519
how he formulates his own operating plan

345
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,880
and his career growth

346
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,600
for him to get to that principal level

347
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,760
is now incredibly convoluted

348
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,880
and it's unclear how really dragos or

349
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,839
how the team

350
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,800
should address pentest and so while

351
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,040
individually they seem successful

352
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,720
having that baseline having the uh

353
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,760
tactical and really uh the

354
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,880
the kind of programmatic uh discipline

355
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,959
in place for how that work is being done

356
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,399
i think is critical

357
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,040
and then uh very importantly have some

358
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,639
enablement plan

359
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,519
have if it's mentoring or knowledge base

360
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,200
or you stand up a learning management

361
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,000
system

362
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,200
to enable those kind of

363
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,800
try not to use the word junior but the

364
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,000
consultant or entry level staff

365
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,519
you will do a disservice to your team

366
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,880
if you bring in a bunch of

367
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,800
consultant level people without

368
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,320
acknowledging the time that they will

369
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,480
take from your principal level staff

370
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,399
that mentoring that enablement is

371
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,760
critical

372
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,320
the idea i was talking about pen testing

373
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,760
before so going with that

374
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,519
the idea that you're going to teach them

375
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,519
pen testing is not there

376
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,600
but you need to teach them the baseline

377
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,440
you need to teach them your company's

378
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,399
approach

379
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,000
to pen testing so ensure you have that

380
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,880
uh reorganized now is a good time again

381
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,480
we talk about mentoring to look at kind

382
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,079
of the middle management

383
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,040
uh and a pivot to that is the career

384
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,240
growth plan

385
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,959
and really the first kind of uh or

386
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,079
excuse me the second

387
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,440
square uh box down below there at this

388
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,399
point your company

389
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,959
maybe one three five seven years in

390
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,959
you've got the original principles the

391
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,880
original already very senior level

392
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,680
people that came

393
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,920
in they built the foundation they wrote

394
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,360
the baselines

395
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,560
uh they created the enablement and so

396
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,399
your career plan has to have a plan for

397
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:22,800
them

398
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,839
as well you've got people very uh

399
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,240
senior in their career scope where do we

400
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,279
go from here

401
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,199
and so building out not just a career

402
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,440
plan for the immediate team but

403
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,920
for what what comes in the future in

404
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,000
scale i think is something to uh

405
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,760
uh understand and then the one caution

406
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,639
anticipate

407
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,279
attrition it will certainly always

408
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:45,839
happen

409
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,399
at every if it's a funding round you

410
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,000
know a series abc

411
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,240
or an ipo or just rapid growth

412
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,440
attrition should be anticipated and it

413
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,399
should be

414
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,360
celebrated in in some regard at dragos

415
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,800
we've had people move on

416
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,079
and in those instances

417
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,760
uh it is bringing on maybe someone

418
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,360
advanced in their career but looking for

419
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,279
more opportunity they get a lot of

420
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,120
experience in new areas that maybe they

421
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,040
wouldn't otherwise the

422
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,360
contracts or legal agreements or

423
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,560
partnerships

424
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,000
and they really help build out a

425
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,160
capability they're there for a couple

426
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,440
years and then they go on to be a

427
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,240
director

428
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,519
somewhere or or a vp and so

429
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,519
celebrating the attrition and treating

430
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,800
it like

431
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,639
these individuals came in they advanced

432
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,240
the team very quickly but they also

433
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,680
advanced themselves

434
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,000
and and moved on it doesn't have to be

435
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,839
seen as a negative

436
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,120
thing uh so jumping over to

437
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,639
my one quick note and there were some

438
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,959
great talks earlier today on uh

439
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,680
interviewing and uh specifically skills

440
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,279
to know for pen testing

441
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,320
uh one quick note i would say on

442
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,720
on that uh one i

443
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,399
share a story when i when i left the

444
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,320
government went into private industry

445
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,920
i lived in washington state and the

446
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,000
company was on the east coast

447
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,880
and i realized very quickly that

448
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,480
whenever you

449
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,519
stop work with a remote team from the

450
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,440
time you stop work to the time you start

451
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,079
work

452
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,199
the team continues and work is done and

453
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:21,519
so

454
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,440
regardless of when i woke up and when i

455
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,360
sat down to work i was always

456
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,320
three hours behind the rest of the team

457
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,680
on the east coast

458
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,920
and it really took me six months to

459
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,720
transition

460
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,480
into that and to get over the feeling

461
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,519
like i was constantly playing catch up

462
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,079
i wasn't running i wasn't sprinting

463
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,839
forward with the team i was just keeping

464
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,920
up with the group it felt like

465
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,480
and i caution a lot of people about that

466
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,160
if you're not at your computer

467
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
the team is still going on work is still

468
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,079
being done and that's okay

469
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,639
uh the the key skill that i look for is

470
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,639
the ability to learn quickly

471
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,000
and that comes from previous history

472
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,600
doing incident response

473
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,199
i kind of think of three buckets for

474
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,199
incident response as well as pen testing

475
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,160
and that is

476
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,039
network host and malware or reverse

477
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,480
engineering

478
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,000
you have network traffic the host

479
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,079
forensics and then reverse engineering

480
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,079
and i've known maybe two people in my

481
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,760
life that are experts in all three

482
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,799
generally people are an expert in one or

483
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,480
strong in one and proficient in the

484
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,079
other two but when i

485
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,599
interview people i'm not a fan of uh

486
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,679
like what flags will you would you use

487
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,640
in nmap

488
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,080
or what does uh netstat and ob get you

489
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,480
in my mind those are memories i'm asking

490
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,400
you to recall a specific flag

491
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,520
rather than base the answer on your true

492
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,960
experience

493
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,160
and when i uh apply that

494
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,000
with drago's interviews a good example

495
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,600
is i'm not going to ask them about a

496
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,360
volatility flag

497
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,160
or an immunity you know quick key

498
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,360
instead i'll ask them

499
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,160
a scenario on doing host forensics on

500
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,559
say

501
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,360
a turbine controller and a windmill or a

502
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,480
roller coaster

503
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,919
plc that they've never seen before and

504
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,600
the specific flags are based on the

505
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,520
technology they're irrelevant

506
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,440
you can google those what i'm looking

507
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,320
for is the thought process to say

508
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,240
i would get a manual first so i don't

509
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,400
start plugging in rj45 cables and

510
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,480
overriding volatile

511
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,720
memory addresses and really understand

512
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,160
the device first

513
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,000
and so uh in interviewing too often i

514
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,039
see you know those calls to specifics if

515
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,320
you get the question

516
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,240
translate it back to experience don't

517
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,160
make it be a memory exercise translate

518
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,080
it back to the process and uh

519
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,320
try to talk through it so a whole bunch

520
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,160
of words very very quickly

521
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,320
uh thanks for sticking with me um

522
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,600
checking the one note in uh the track to

523
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,720
chat but if there are any other

524
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,160
questions i don't have the youtube one

525
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,120
pulled up

526
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,400
feel free to shout those out i got

527
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,720
nothing on youtube but you said you saw

528
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,120
the uh the question in the

529
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,400
track two channel uh

530
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,000
cool so it looks like the one question

531
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,440
avoid burnout

532
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,840
yeah uh it took a while to get to a good

533
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,120
operating mode uh but to answer the

534
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,600
question

535
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,679
how do we how do we avoid burnout with

536
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,400
the uh extensive work from home time

537
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,880
uh i think it's in my mind really coming

538
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,400
to an understanding

539
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,799
if the kids have a dentist appointment

540
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,919
i'll take them

541
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,360
or i ask the wife if she can take them

542
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,520
if the kids have some event we kind of

543
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,400
work together

544
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,520
and we don't default on one or the other

545
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,679
it's an understanding that both of us

546
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,120
will participate

547
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,679
now the hard thing is to not have life

548
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,880
and work

549
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,679
24 hours a day because you're trying to

550
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,360
balance everything all the time

551
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,480
and so setting some boundaries uh is

552
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,760
is incredibly important uh

553
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,080
to identify availability and and have

554
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,960
the the mutual respect but i will say

555
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,559
burnout is always a potential uh burnout

556
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,799
uh i'll end this with a very candid

557
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,679
statement

558
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,559
burnout is always a potential regardless

559
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,000
if you're working in the office or

560
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,760
working from home or you have kids or

561
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,200
don't have kids

562
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,200
and when i look at employees i work with

563
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,120
and they're always close to burning out

564
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,880
and they're always telling me i need

565
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,200
time

566
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,480
off the potential is to be seen as the

567
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,679
liability

568
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,600
an employee who works himself into the

569
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,000
hospital is not a good employee

570
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,240
an employee who is mature to identify

571
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,240
the breaking point and communicate what

572
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,600
is practical and set

573
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
expectations on what they're able to

574
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,200
achieve and the resources they've been

575
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,240
given

576
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,880
that is good so i think really there's

577
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,360
no

578
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,799
avoid burnout it's uh in my view

579
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,200
understanding what your capabilities are

580
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,320
within reason

581
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,200
and clearly communicating those that is

582
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
the best way to avoid burnout it's not

583
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,679
uh

584
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,320
do more with less it's what is practical

585
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,000
and how do i communicate that to level

586
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,120
set expectations so

587
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,760
uh yeah and great great comment in uh

588
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,120

set boundaries communicate those uh to

590
