1
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,760
okay still waiting on the youtube side

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,200

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,160
okay should be soon and checking in the

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,599
back end too for other

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,279
monitors and we're live three two one go

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,840
hey good afternoon everybody uh thanks

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,240
for joining the b-sides event today and

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,680
i just want to thank the event

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,279
organizers for having me

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,640
uh this will be a little bit different

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,558
talk uh it's not about red teaming or

12
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,399
blue teaming or purple teaming it's

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:34,800
about

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,520
polyhedral dice teaming so this is all

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,399
the skills

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,559
from dungeons and dragons that i think

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,600
are critical

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,520
that are used in the workplace so i hope

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,360
everybody has their little polyhedral

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:45,920
dice

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,360
ready to go this will be a little bit

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,719
different time all right so i'm not

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,079
going to spend too much time about who

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,680
am i i can make the slides available

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,199
later if anybody wants them

26
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,079
i'm an army veteran served 10 years i

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,000
spent several years as a contractor a

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,359
few years in federal government

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,000
backing contracting my area of expertise

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,400
is cyber threat intelligence analysis

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,159
uh i will take all questions about

32
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,840
role-playing games and about soccer

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,760
so i'm assuming most people here

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,600
watching the stream have some idea what

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,200
dungeons and dragons is but if you just

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,119
came across this randomly and you don't

37
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:17,600
know

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,080
this is a tabletop rpg a tabletop

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,280
role-playing game

40
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,600
generally in person with between two to

41
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,720
eight people

42
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,360
obviously in the covid world the online

43
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,040
aspects of this have

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,600
increased so there's a lot more online

45
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,439
versions and groups doing this

46
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,360
and yes the nerdiest game on earth

47
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,640
requires you to play

48
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,119
with some of your closest friends or

49
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,400
frenemies

50
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,960
um so we have tons of books dice

51
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,280
miniatures or the little figures

52
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,040
um and just so you understand some of

53
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,200
the lingo the dungeon master or

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,320
game master dm or gm sort of organizes

55
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,000
the event they're the narrator

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,840
the arbiter of rules they run the

57
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,000
sessions that all the players

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,240
participate in and the adventuring party

59
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,920
are all of the people who are playing in

60
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,560
the game

61
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,600
that are not the dm or gm

62
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,399
we use dice to add randomness to the

63
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,360
game

64
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,680
so polyhedral dice are a thing that all

65
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,200
of us rpg players

66
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,959
use so what does dungeons and dragons

67
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,400
look like it could look like

68
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,200
this people sitting around with a map

69
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,680
right

70
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,840
so this is the non-online version it

71
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,040
could look like this

72
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,120
it is available for people of every age

73
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,560
or group every background

74
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,319
plays dungeons dragons and role-playing

75
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,080
games and it looks like this because

76
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,239
everybody has a ton of material and

77
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,319
books and references

78
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,080
and actually i don't even play dungeons

79
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,840
and dragons anymore technically i play

80
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,519
pathfinder but that's a whole nother

81
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,319
discussion

82
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,920
we may get into so why

83
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,560
so to get into the meat of this skills

84
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,080
that i have acquired through dungeons

85
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,519
and dragons and role-playing games that

86
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,879
i use in the workplace

87
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,160
research and reading comprehension so

88
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,319
i have a few terms up here meritocracy

89
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,159
oligarchy patriarchy

90
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,040
i learned about all of these terms from

91
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,560
books that i was reading when i was a

92
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,519
teenager

93
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,599
that's the first time i read about why

94
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,200
is the feudal government set up the way

95
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,080
it is

96
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,680
um and it was like the library of

97
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,680
alexandria because yes this is a fantasy

98
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,720
based game

99
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,400
but there's a lot of elements in it that

100
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
have historical or real world

101
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,280
applications

102
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,400
like governments monetary systems um

103
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,720
how we want to organize the a lawful

104
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,080
system of government

105
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,799
what are the laws who gets to decide

106
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:27,519
right so

107
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,040
a lot of a lot of times you might not

108
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,799
think that that goes into a fantasy

109
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,959
setting but it really does

110
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,680
so as a gm or as a player you might be

111
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,360
doing a lot of research and

112
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,920
a lot of in-depth reading comprehension

113
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,560
if you

114
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,799
take these games fairly seriously and

115
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,959
then as a gm or someone that runs the

116
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,080
games we're interested

117
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,920
in you know reading up on what's the

118
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,120
weather going to be like for this

119
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,799
session what sorts of religions might be

120
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,560
involved are there unusual plants

121
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,760
different monsters

122
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,519
how will magic work are there some

123
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,159
podcasts i should listen to to get ideas

124
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,080
right and it goes on and on and on in

125
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,159
terms of research and reading comprehen

126
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,560
comprehension and a lot of people who

127
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,319
are interested in role-playing games

128
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,720
are voracious readers right we are

129
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,360
consuming large amounts of information

130
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,799
right does that sound like something we

131
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,879
might do in cyber absolutely

132
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,798
regardless of where you're at in cyber

133
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,279
security we're consuming huge amounts of

134
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,279
information so i said i work in cyber

135
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,560
threat intelligence

136
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,400
so i am focused on a particular

137
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,639
geographic area in the world but even

138
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,000
with that limitation

139
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
there's a huge amount of threat actors

140
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,120
that i have to follow

141
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,040
so being able to consume a lot of

142
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
information and understand it is really

143
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,520
critical

144
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,320
so the other big one here is written in

145
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,400
verbal communication skills

146
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,040
so again not a hard technical skill

147
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,759
there's no

148
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,840
there's no comp tier ec council

149
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,600
presentation plus

150
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,479
certificates that you can get but we all

151
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,040
know

152
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,840
that people in our field have to have

153
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,639
these skills

154
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,080
this even came up in an earlier

155
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
presentation about the pen testing where

156
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,759
we talked about the written reports

157
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,759
and how critical the written report is

158
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,440
and who is the report for

159
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,840
is there an actual executive section is

160
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,000
the executive section something that an

161
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,680
executive can actually read and

162
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,440
understand and benefit from

163
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,479
from a business aspect and

164
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,919
and obviously anybody who plays

165
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,520
role-playing games and dungeons of

166
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,639
dragons

167
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,240
communication is huge right so notes to

168
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,919
the players planning your sessions

169
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,240
trying to figure out npc backstories as

170
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,039
a gm

171
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,720
as a player character figuring out your

172
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,400
backstory right there's

173
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
written communication and some people do

174
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,759
that more or less than

175
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,880
others but from um

176
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,560
people i know friends and associates

177
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,160
that play this game especially if they

178
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,639
begin

179
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,520
early writing and speaking in front of

180
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,080
other people

181
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,440
tends to come a little bit more

182
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,680
naturally so i think there's a direct

183
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,639
correlation to being involved in

184
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,160
dungeons dragons and role-playing games

185
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,960
like this

186
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,000
and having a comfort with some written

187
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,520
and verbal communication

188
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,280
so this is not to say that you should

189
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,039
necessarily play dungeon dragons to

190
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,400
increase these skills

191
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
but these skills definitely are used

192
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,319
both when i'm

193
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,880
running games playing games and at work

194
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,360
as well

195
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,639
so the next thing cooperative problem

196
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,759
solving

197
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,039
so anybody john real quick sorry

198
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,960
could you stop your share and reshare it

199
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,880
it looks like we're getting some

200
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,639
share issues where it's going over the

201
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,720
screen

202
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,840
thank you sorry about that

203
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,520
so i've reshared perfect presentation

204
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,479
thank you is that working

205
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,759
yeah perfect thank you all right sure

206
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,120
it wouldn't be an online event if there

207
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
weren't some technical difficulties

208
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,000
so um cooperative problem solving

209
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,680
everybody who's done a group project

210
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,520
anywhere in their school understands

211
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
this right so

212
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,160
at work we are going to routinely be

213
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,800
asked to

214
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,000
solve problems overcome challenges in a

215
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,199
team right in a group right so from the

216
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,199
dungeons and dragons perspective like

217
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,919
every encounter every session is going

218
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,440
to have problem solving

219
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,599
and this can be both in game in the

220
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,840
fantasy world itself and out of game

221
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,960
right there's going to be problems that

222
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,440
arise

223
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,360
out of the game as well how do you

224
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,880
interpret a particular rule

225
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
how does this spell work i remember

226
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,560
going back and forth about

227
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,280
you know the mathematical formulas about

228
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,000
volume

229
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,120
related to fireballs at one point um it

230
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,639
the rules did not really go into that

231
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,800
level of detail necessary

232
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,759
so this also will tie into critical

233
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,880
thinking as well

234
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,960
because in cooperative problem solving

235
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,400
we often should

236
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,479
be getting diversity of ideas so we

237
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,919
don't have group think

238
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,960
and that's really important as well and

239
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,800
we'll come back to an idea related to

240
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,120
groupthink when we talk about creativity

241
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,960
but problem solving and understanding

242
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
team dynamics and how to work within a

243
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,120
team is going to be really important

244
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,160
in your cyber security career right i am

245
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,960
not a fan

246
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,440
of the mantra of infosec rockstars i

247
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,800
don't think that works

248
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,560
i don't think that they have been

249
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,160
particularly helpful the ones that i

250
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,360
have encountered

251
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,680
and the people who are better at working

252
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,720
as a team

253
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,199
and collaboratively and cooperatively

254
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,199
trying to figure out solutions to

255
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,240
problems

256
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,039
are probably going to do better than

257
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,680
people who

258
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,039
are rugged individuals who have trouble

259
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,080
in teams

260
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,840
that's not to say they might not have a

261
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,599
good career but

262
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,000
i've seen that person not do as well as

263
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,760
people who can embrace cooperative

264
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,880
problem solving

265
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,559
so everybody who's played in a role

266
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,080
playing game knows

267
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,440
how difficult this can be

268
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,440
so the other thing if you're someone

269
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,200
that runs games is a gm

270
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,959
or a dm man the planning you have to do

271
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,279
to run your game and get it successful

272
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,320
especially now

273
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,279
in covid and maybe it's gone online or

274
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,000
maybe

275
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,120
there's certain people in your sort of

276
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,959
family pod that you're playing with and

277
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,480
you've had to change the game because

278
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,760
other people aren't

279
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,080
you're not in contact with them so this

280
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
is basically project management i mean

281
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,440
this is planning

282
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,320
right any time you're planning people

283
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,920
planning anything with adults it's

284
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,800
complicated

285
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,560
right we've all had a facebook invite

286
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,800
invited 150 people to some facebook

287
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
event and then three people show up

288
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,399
right that's just how it works when

289
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,920
we're all adults

290
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,320
so what do we do with conflicts so

291
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,920
conflicts around planning

292
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,680
right just like the meme on the slide

293
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,200
says do you if

294
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,920
if 75 of the crew can make a session do

295
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,440
you have the session well what do you do

296
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,640
for the person who couldn't make the

297
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,120
session

298
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,720
how do you handle that are they going to

299
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,240
be frustrated are they going to be upset

300
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,440
do they understand what if the do they

301
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,040
get experienced if they weren't able to

302
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,000
make the session

303
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,360
or are they going to be a level below

304
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,800
everybody else because then that might

305
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,120
have to change the encounter level

306
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,440
right so all of that goes into planning

307
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,560
hey john real quick

308
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,800
sorry again could you stop sharing

309
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,480
reshare again we're getting the screen

310
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,160
artifact again thank you sorry

311
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
how's that you're good

312
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,839
you're good all right so

313
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,160
and then this is also in and out of game

314
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,760
right so there's planning in game of

315
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,360
what's gonna happen in the session are

316
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,120
we using a pre-made adventure am i gonna

317
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,399
run my own adventure

318
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,240
you know what what encounters am i gonna

319
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,600
have am i gonna have some random

320
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,279
encounters am i going to wing it

321
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,959
right i actually enjoy winging it quite

322
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,560
a bit when i'm the gm with

323
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,760
certain things planned but not

324
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,680
everything and what about the calendars

325
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,160
and

326
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,399
emails and invites and coordination

327
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,839
right which also ties back into

328
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,200
communication

329
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,640
right and there's some other planning

330
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,440
and project management also around

331
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,519
dealing with your friends right so it's

332
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,839
one thing at work to have

333
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,480
teamwork and project management and

334
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,240
cooperative problem solving

335
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,600
it's another thing to do with people

336
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,680
that are your friends in you know from

337
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,200
your role-playing groups

338
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,480
as well that adds another level of uh

339
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,640
you know potential stress to to get

340
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,760
things working

341
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,800
uh with everybody

342
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,360
so moving on so creativity and

343
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,720
imagination

344
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,560
so this is one of the ones that i think

345
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,240
is often undervalued

346
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,720
in our world but those of us who are

347
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,079
ever in the military have

348
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,160
all have at some point and probably

349
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,680
multiple times

350
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,519
ask the question of why do we do it that

351
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,200
way and the answer has been

352
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,959
because that's how we do it or because

353
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,640
that's how we've always done it

354
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,519
right so no one has thought of a better

355
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,600
way to do some particular process

356
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
so this could be technical this could be

357
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,959
directly related to something

358
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,399
technically that you're doing in the

359
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:46,880
field

360
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,240
or it could be something related to

361
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,800
process right it could be an sop

362
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,399
that maybe doesn't make sense anymore

363
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,000
because it hasn't been updated in three

364
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,720
years

365
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,800
uh it could be about how we handle

366
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
patching and why are we patching this

367
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,519
way

368
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,720
right so imagination and creativity

369
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
is obviously hugely important for those

370
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,320
of us that play role-playing games

371
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,440
you know dungeons of dragons or

372
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,040
whichever role-playing game you want

373
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,560
cthulhu

374
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,320
d20 modern and we can use this in the

375
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,560
workplace when we are trying to overcome

376
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,240
a problem or a challenge

377
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,560
right those of us that are creative and

378
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,880
really do use our imagination routinely

379
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,000
can come up with some other ideas the

380
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,519
other place that i think that this is

381
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,120
really important that's not on the slide

382
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,240
is to be a to play devil's advocate if

383
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,720
you are

384
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,120
in a situation or a meeting where

385
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,320
everyone has sort of

386
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,160
agreed very quickly to do x

387
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,760
right you might want to play devil's

388
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
advocate to throw some other ideas out

389
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,160
there

390
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,800
they might not actually even be ideas

391
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,240
you want to see implemented

392
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,320
but it may help to get the conversation

393
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,399
going it may help to

394
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,160
figure out some pros and cons on

395
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,839
solution x that people have already

396
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,000
decided is the way to go

397
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,440
and then in my world and in red teaming

398
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,920
and adversary emulation and pen testing

399
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,480
can you think like the adversary and i

400
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,440
don't mean

401
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,360
can you think like the adversary that i

402
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,120
might once i'm on the box use a

403
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,639
powershell exploit

404
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,160
to to laterally move i also mean think

405
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,680
like the adversary like

406
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,800
we are a large fortune 20 bank who is

407
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,760
being attacked by

408
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,240
apt-123 and what are the motivations and

409
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,360
goals of this

410
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,079
persistent threat actor it could also be

411
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,600
understanding the geopolitical

412
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,560
environment

413
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,600
right if you are working at a very large

414
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,480
organization with offices worldwide the

415
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,639
geopolitical climate in different places

416
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,920
is going to change

417
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,720
over time the threat landscape may

418
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,440
change

419
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,519
much differently in those disparate

420
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,720
locations

421
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,040
so can someone who is creative and

422
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,560
imaginative

423
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,959
also better lend themselves to think

424
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,800
more like the adversary

425
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,720
so i think that's another area that this

426
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,839
can also be applied to

427
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,160
so i covered a number of different

428
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,440
things already

429
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,519
so hopefully the slide is good because

430
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,720
there's a lot of

431
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,199
other infosec related skills that i

432
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,880
think are directly applicable

433
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,720
to those of us who enjoy role-playing

434
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,320
games and participate either

435
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,360
as a player or as a gm red dm

436
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,839
so i like thinking on your feet right

437
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,199
because no matter

438
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,680
how good you have planned an encounter

439
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,800
or a session

440
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,360
the players are gonna railroad you and

441
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,800
go off on some tangent

442
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,000
right it always happens so as a dm

443
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
or gm i wanna embrace that and i wanna

444
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,199
come up with something real quick

445
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,320
off top my feet off the top of my head

446
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,120
right and this is actually applied to me

447
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,839
before

448
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,880
i was in the workplace and a senior

449
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,720
uh executive just walked up behind me

450
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,079
and starts talking to me

451
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,600
right man you want to make a good

452
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,360
impression right i know who this person

453
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,040
is they are very important to this

454
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,240
organization

455
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,000
so think on your feet answer the

456
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,360
questions

457
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,680
it also basically got me my first job in

458
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,760
cyber because we were walking around

459
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,360
because we're on the bench which is in

460
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,120
consulting you're waiting to be client

461
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,920
facing

462
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,480
and we basically overheard some people

463
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,240
talking about a problem they had

464
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,399
and uh that was how my buddy and i

465
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,000
signed ourselves up to

466
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,079
make a four-week course for the army

467
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,440
about cyber

468
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,600
in three weeks which was very

469
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,199
interesting

470
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,480
critical thinking and root cause

471
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,560
analysis root cause analysis

472
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,920
why is the evil wizard

473
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,639
in this village why does he keep

474
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,160
attacking this village

475
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,480
what is the deal with him and this small

476
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,240
village of 75 people

477
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,480
like what's the what's the motive that

478
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,519
he has

479
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,639
to cause mayhem for these poor peasants

480
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,360
out in the wilderness right and

481
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,920
obviously

482
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,240
that's the d d example but root cause

483
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,440
analysis

484
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,920
finding the thing that's wrong is

485
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,480
obviously an infosec scale

486
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,920
whether we're talking about like

487
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,240
figuring out a firewall problem

488
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,079
um is it a discord problem

489
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,399
that root cause analysis something that

490
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,000
um we're doing

491
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,160
in the game but we're not thinking about

492
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,079
it routinely

493
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,040
so uh the social emotional learning or

494
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,600
social

495
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,160
intelligence is not something that gets

496
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,440
discussed a lot

497
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,920
but as you play games with your friends

498
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,120
and there's conflicts

499
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,759
in and out of the game with your group

500
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,800
of friends

501
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,279
right that is teaching you some skills

502
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,880
around social emotional

503
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,079
development and social techniques

504
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,480
to solve problems right so this is

505
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,600
something that i think is pretty

506
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,240
interesting

507
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,560
as a as a person who's led individuals

508
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,160
led teams at work

509
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,639
right trying to resolve problems with

510
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,519
people at work

511
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,680
is sort of one level of difficulty and

512
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,560
stress

513
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,800
right you may like some people at work

514
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,480
you may not like some people at work you

515
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,320
might like your boss you might not like

516
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,519
your boss

517
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,680
right but when you are in a group like

518
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,600
this and you want it to be fun

519
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,279
generally you're playing with people you

520
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,439
get along with to some degree

521
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,760
but when there's a conflict there you

522
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,880
are now

523
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,280
in a conflict resolution state with

524
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,039
people that you care about

525
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,280
which means that hopefully then you

526
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
could parlay that skill

527
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,000
to being a better conflict resolution

528
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,119
manager

529
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,400
at work because you have done it in this

530
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,839
environment

531
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,760
i really think um all of the skills

532
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,200
that kind of are on this slide speak to

533
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,520
the soft critical skills

534
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,080
that oftentimes we're not talking about

535
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,320
a lot in the cyber security and infosec

536
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,520
community

537
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,880
um like the researching the ability to

538
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
communicate effectively

539
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,120
um there was a presentation at hacker

540
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,280
halted

541
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,240
earlier this week where we talked about

542
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,360
communication

543
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,320
we talked about report writing so i know

544
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,720
that a lot of very technical folks

545
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,520
do not like to be the people writing

546
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,280
reports regardless of field if you're a

547
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,080
pen tester

548
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,600
you're on a blue team you're in cyber

549
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,919
thread intel right a lot of people

550
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,520
don't like writing reports i

551
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,799
do not have a problem with writing

552
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,120
reports a lot of problems also have

553
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,480
a lot of people also have some

554
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,400
challenges and problems with speaking

555
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,280
even in front of very small groups right

556
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,919
so

557
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,720
those of us that you know go and play

558
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,000
role playing games have

559
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
spoken in front of at least small groups

560
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,080
of people which is generally

561
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,000
how we encourage people to build up

562
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,679
their confidence to speak in front of

563
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,960
groups

564
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,440
not everyone in the career field needs

565
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,200
to get on stage at a b

566
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,320
sides or get in front of executives

567
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,480
but if you want to have career

568
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,360
flexibility

569
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,240
and growth and promotion both of these

570
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,840
things are going to be critical

571
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,480
writing reports briefing people it's a

572
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,679
huge part

573
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,960
of how you'll be able to advance your

574
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,240
career

575
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,919
in addition to all of the other things

576
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,080
on here i know i sort of briefly touched

577
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,760
on that project management and planning

578
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,880
and scheduling

579
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,840
but that is huge in a work environment

580
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,440
understanding your boss's schedule

581
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,120
making other people informed of your

582
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,919
calendar

583
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,640
i mean i take that skill for granted but

584
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,280
based on

585
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,000
first-hand experience this is not a set

586
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,440
of skills that people just

587
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,200
inherently have um so that is actually

588
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,240
really important

589
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
because we need project management we

590
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,760
need people to make sure

591
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
everybody's coming together at the right

592
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,000
time frames to accomplish

593
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,240
those particular tasks so we can deliver

594
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,120
the solution

595
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,679
or you know come to come to whatever

596
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,280
that project needs to be at the end of

597
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,960
the day

598
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,440
so i think and those of you who have

599
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,720
played dungeon dragons or other

600
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,919
role-playing games

601
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,760
right there's a lot of things that we're

602
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,000
doing in the game in-game out of game

603
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,039
with that group that translate into some

604
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,080
really important

605
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,559
skills that you can use in the workplace

606
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,559
so i did want to leave a little bit of

607
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,640
time for some questions and answers so

608
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,440
i will try to see if i can see anything

609
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,480
in the discord

610
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,919
chat um and if not

611
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,240
then i can talk about one or two other

612
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,159
points

613
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,600
so let me see if there's anything in

614
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,720
discord john i'm not seeing anything

615
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,200
yet i'll let you know also from the

616
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,760
youtube

617
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,000
also just to let you know the slides you

618
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,600
might have to reshare again there now i

619
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,799
can see it okay

620
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,919
thank you oh interesting okay

621
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,200
um yeah so if i don't have any questions

622
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,720
um i'm a big big advocate of

623
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,320
especially for junior folks who are

624
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,159
trying to make their way into cyber

625
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,120
security

626
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,799
right there's been a few presentations

627
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,559
that sort of talked on that subject

628
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,280
today

629
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,320
it's obviously a big concern

630
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,760
is um one alissa miller's presentation

631
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,960
for on barista to bartender barista to

632
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,240
penhester

633
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,159
where we talk about the skills that a

634
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,679
barista might have

635
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,760
right i take multiple inputs and

636
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,679
prioritize them to accomplish certain

637
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:06,559
tasks

638
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,080
right so when you're if you're a junior

639
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,720
you're trying to shape your resume based

640
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,720
on your volunteer work projects you did

641
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,559
in school

642
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,280
right we we want to think about all of

643
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,440
the skills that are critical to make you

644
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,039
successful at work

645
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,080
i mean clearly clearly

646
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,240
we you're going to need some technical

647
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,480
skills to work in cyber security

648
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,520
obviously depending on your

649
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,120
specialization that might change a

650
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,000
little bit

651
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,240
but most of these skills are on the

652
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,080
slide and that i've talked about

653
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,280
are gonna really be helpful to you

654
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,520
uh regardless of which specialization

655
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,320
you find yourself in in cyber security

656
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,400
um so i'm not necessarily advocating

657
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,000
that everyone should go play dungeons

658
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,159
and dragons to get these skills

659
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,400
but i think that there are there's

660
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,280
methods to

661
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,919
get these types of skills if some of

662
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:58,799
them

663
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,799
aren't something that's already in your

664
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,919
toolkit there's

665
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,840
classes about critical thinking there's

666
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,440
classes you can take about root cause

667
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,880
analysis

668
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,960
and this may vary depending on where

669
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,120
exactly

670
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,720
you know you find yourself in the

671
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,080
community because there's so many

672
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,799
different specializations

673
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,960
um yeah in terms of gamification and

674
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,120
learning i see a comment in there

675
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,720
that's definitely something that you

676
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,400
know certain organizations and

677
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,120
businesses

678
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,240
are doing to gamify learning as well so

679
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,120
that's another

680
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,799
tie-in for those of us who have skills

681
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,080
in the rpg arena and have

682
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,840
you know or our gamers right we can

683
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,320
translate how that works to gamification

684
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,120
i understand how quest lines should work

685
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,039
right there's there's a lot of theory we

686
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,440
could get in about why people play video

687
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
games and what keeps them hooked

688
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,679
into video games right so could we

689
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,000
gamify ctfs even more

690
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,080
so that people are earning you know

691
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,240
rewards as they go along to make sure

692
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,600
that they get hooked

693
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,440
you know that's you know that's pretty

694
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,799
interesting um

695
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,200
to think about from that perspective um

696
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,480
so yeah i don't know if there was

697
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,320
anything else if i missed any other

698
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,960
messages there

699
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,799
yeah yeah so i yeah i yeah um

700
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,280
i don't have a off the top my head i

701
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,159
couldn't tell you where to get

702
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,080
additional resources related to that

703
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,000
but if you're in the infosec twitter

704
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,080
space which i highly encourage

705
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,760
there are definitely people you know

706
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,600
doing gamification

707
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,640
um of cyber related uh learning so

708
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,559
yes that is definitely happening so

709
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,080
again if you want to bridge two things

710
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,760

714
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,360
training

715
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,000
virtual training range training are

716
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
trying to incorporate gamification into

717
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,640
that as well

718
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,640
all right thank you john sorry about the
