00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,600
so thanks eric and uh sin ming for

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,399
getting us going and getting us running

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,200
so today i plan on presenting on getting

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,719
started in digital forensics and

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,680
incident response or dfir

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,960
and this is a topic that's kind of near

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,239
and dear to me

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,800
that i've kind of worked my way into a

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,719
little bit of luck but we'll talk about

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,399
how someone might be able to get into

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,160
this same type of career field and the

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,800
same path

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,800
if you're interested and want to kind of

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,400
steer into that you decide that that's

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
kind of your slice of

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,520
a slice of cyber that you want to do

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,920
so talking about my background uh like i

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,080
said i'm currently with the with itd

30
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,799
um in the past i've worked with super

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,320
value albertsons

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,799
uh a fortune 100 retailer working

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,080
endpoint security

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,720
and then i did some stuff with ocio or

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,240
its is

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,640
the organization keith tresh is with

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,079
from our keynote today

38
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,079
so that was some number of years ago

39
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,119
i've got about

40
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,040
coming up on 10 years of experience

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,159
doing

42
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,479
cyber security and i've spent the last

43
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,119
about five or six of it doing

44
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,880
um incident response and digital

45
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,720
forensics

46
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,759
so um these are of course you know that

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,960
i'm doing this presentation

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,920
independently

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,840
uh separate from the organizations that

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,600
i've formally been a part of so these

51
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,880
are my opinions

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,920
um but we'll uh we'll jump into

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,560
what we what the plan is to cover for

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,159
the next 20 minutes

55
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,280
um we're going to cover what is dfir

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,119
we're going to talk about some of the

57
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,878
different tools and skills that you

58
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,000
might have

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,959
that you might be able to implement in

60
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,959
what i find valuable and have

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,000
been able to leverage in my career how

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,599
someone might kind of

63
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,680
steer into that get into it if it's

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,120
something that they find themselves

65
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,160
interested in

66
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,720
and then finally once the presentation's

67
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,959
over i have a kind of a slick sheet

68
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,360
of some different free resources and

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,599
paid resources as well

70
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,680
that if you're interested in doing more

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,720
in this field

72
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,360
that you will be able to kind of

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,640
leverage and

74
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,840
and uh and work off of

75
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,480
so i kind of felt it was important to

76
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,239
kind of talk about how i

77
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,080
started in in forensics and

78
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,840
or dfir and kind of just so you

79
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,720
understand

80
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,920
where i came from i

81
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,200
had the first case that i

82
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,120
that i worked on um was

83
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,120
years and years ago my manager at the

84
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
time came to me who handled all of the

85
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,920
the forensics work and she was going to

86
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,200
be out the next week

87
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,920
and so she said hey you know we might

88
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
have something come up next week

89
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,920
um there you know i need you to kind of

90
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,680
take care of something for me

91
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,480
and uh there's kind of three things to

92
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,239
keep in mind

93
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,840
that first of all you know we've got

94
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,920
this write block kit use that

95
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,239
uh use use dd to image the hard drive

96
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,159
and um also take down the details of the

97
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,440
hard drive

98
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,480
so not having done it before just kind

99
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,000
of took her word for it

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,400
i uh you know she had talked it up a lot

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,080
about how difficult it was

102
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,519
how detail-oriented it was so i went out

103
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,080
to uh to barnes and noble of all places

104
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,680
and uh you know back when they actually

105
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,159
sold computer books and i got myself my

106
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:04,799
first

107
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,599
digital forensics book um which was the

108
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,439
hacking exposed digital forensics

109
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,720
computer forensics book

110
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,319
big yellow book i still have it it's um

111
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,759
well well used but i uh read through

112
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,120
some of that over the weekend

113
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,199
just to prime myself on some of the the

114
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,720
ins and outs of what i was going to be

115
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,560
potentially asked to do the next week

116
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,080
i got the call later than or

117
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,199
in the next week past weekend and uh

118
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,600
off i went someone got fired it was

119
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,360
potentially that they were going to sue

120
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,400
we needed to do forensics on that

121
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,080
computer

122
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,360
so i ran off and i collected the

123
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,840
computer

124
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,440
brought it back to my desk brought over

125
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,960
the right blocking kit hooked everything

126
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,560
up pulled my book out

127
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,919
uh did dd on the hard drive

128
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,000
um over to blank media and

129
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,320
i looked at the hard drive not having

130
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,600
like ever really paid that much

131
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,120
attention to the number of details on

132
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,639
the hard drive i didn't really know what

133
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,320
details i needed at the time

134
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,680
so i thought well there's like a

135
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,199
thousand words here and a picture's

136
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,199
worth a thousand words so i just flopped

137
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,360
that hard drive onto a photocopy machine

138
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,479
a xerox machine

139
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,759
next to my desk and hit go stored

140
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,720
the paper copy with uh with the hard

141
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,280
drive

142
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,560
copy where i was supposed to store it

143
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,080
and i remember getting back to my desk

144
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,840
and saying you know

145
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,280
digital forensics is boring um

146
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,800
i can't do this like this is this is uh

147
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,320
there's no way that i could do this as a

148
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,080
daily job thank goodness

149
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,280
i'm doing cyber security instead

150
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,000
and the world kind of has funny ways in

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,039
which it works

152
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,000
and uh and now i do so what i didn't

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,440
know then is really what digital

154
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,120
forensics and incident response was all

155
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,400
about

156
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,919
so figure let's cover that um

157
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,639
dfir split up into digital forensics and

158
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,639
incident response

159
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,880
uh incident response really we're

160
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,240
focusing on

161
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,840
actually dealing with an active threat

162
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,199
there's a very high presentation there's

163
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,560
a lot of nuances

164
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,880
but i just wanted to kind of break this

165
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,840
down so

166
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,520
we're focusing on an active threat to

167
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,039
the organization

168
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,479
and stopping that containing it

169
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,000
boxing it in and eliminating it and then

170
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,080
on the digital forensics side we're more

171
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,520
going in and trying to find the

172
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,520
we're processing the digital evidence to

173
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,199
actually find the answers

174
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,560
uh that we're seeking in our

175
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,319
investigation

176
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,160
uh the incident response i kind of find

177
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,000
akin to

178
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,680
um like a paramedic who arrives on like

179
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,000
a crime scene

180
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,440
um they will often

181
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,039
just stabilize the patient and

182
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,720
will provide certain medical

183
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,560
interventions just to get things going

184
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,479
in the right direction for them

185
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,400
uh whereas a detective will come in and

186
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,680
kind of do you know

187
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,199
something like digital forensics where

188
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,440
they're going to look into

189
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,039
what this specific issue is they're

190
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,720
going to find out who was at fault what

191
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,800
weapon was used what tool was used was

192
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,560
it forced or not forced

193
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,199
so on and so forth so that's kind of an

194
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,039
easy way i tend to differentiate the two

195
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,680
forensics also it tends to be it's it's

196
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,560
forensics

197
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,680
was uh was its root it's a latin root

198
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,039
um back from roman era when we would

199
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:25,759
have kind of

200
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,880
public court and so it's it's a you know

201
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,520
in a forum in front of forum so

202
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,440
[Music]

203
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,919
a lot of times uh forensics will still

204
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:38,639
be tied

205
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,120
to uh legal process there's lots of

206
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,319
arguments about that

207
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,919
and this that's outside the scope of

208
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,919
this presentation

209
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,599
so let's talk about now that you kind of

210
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,680
know what it is a little bit or a little

211
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,199
bit more about it

212
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,639
maybe you're like hey this is

213
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,039
interesting i'm curious

214
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,440
i've seen this on tv and maybe i want to

215
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,800
do this myself

216
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,400
so let's talk about a couple common

217
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,919
career paths

218
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,560
uh that you can take into this uh the

219
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,800
two most common that i see

220
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,120
are and there are others but the two

221
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,280
most common are law enforcement

222
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
coming up with a legal background going

223
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,800
through a detective into a crime lab

224
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,639
something like that

225
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,400
or the other side is that incident

226
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,240
response mentality

227
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,639
of defending networks and investigating

228
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,080
intrusions

229
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,560
usually like military dod federal

230
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
networks things like that

231
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,440
those the two most common like

232
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,680
experiences

233
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,240
i see uh when i look at forensic

234
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,440
practitioners

235
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,839
um that you know i follow and things

236
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,599
so i did neither of those

237
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,320
i went a different route and so i kind

238
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,839
of wanted to talk about how

239
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,040
i did this route and how you might do

240
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,000
that route as well

241
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,200
so really if we're looking at at law

242
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,959
enforcement and military kind of having

243
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,080
this like fat

244
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
they they get a leg up with a lot of the

245
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,000
ex the hard earned experience that they

246
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,320
get

247
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,200
up front a lot of the the the things

248
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,720
they encounter that just

249
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,760
we don't deal with in everyday life

250
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,839
so we have to kind of compensate for

251
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,120
that and

252
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,760
a part of that is being in the right

253
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,240
place

254
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,399
at the right time with the right tools

255
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,080
and i found that this is kind of

256
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,959
a algorithm that is at the heart of

257
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,640
every

258
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
every major change that i've done in my

259
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,480
career

260
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,080
is i've been in the right place at the

261
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,800
right time with the right tools

262
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,440
but being the right place and the right

263
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,800
time are

264
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,600
largely luck-based so we really can't

265
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,720
influence those

266
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,839
as much as we want to uh so we really

267
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,399
need to focus in on the right tools

268
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,560
and in tools i don't necessarily mean

269
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,760
tools as in like

270
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,200
hardware or kit though will

271
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
that is a part of it we'll get into that

272
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,440
eventually i'm thinking more the soft

273
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,480
skills the

274
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,320
the attributes um things like that so

275
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,040
let's

276
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,120
let's take that and let's separate that

277
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,480
off and let's see what we can do

278
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,680
about actually influencing those right

279
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
tools

280
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,160
section so really

281
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,240
i've broken it into four pieces here we

282
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,000
have education experience

283
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,920
attributes and equipment um education

284
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,279
this is you know something hotly

285
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,200
contested keith even

286
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,440
um even talked about this in his in his

287
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,079
presentation working with the colleges

288
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,959
degrees while i don't have a degree and

289
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:33,600
degrees

290
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,519
aren't what i would consider absolutely

291
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,959
necessary um

292
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,120
there are a lot of doors that are opened

293
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,320
by having a degree

294
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,440
as opposed to not having one

295
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,360
instead i kind of go down the path of

296
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,920
certifications

297
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,640
i'm fortunate to have to have been able

298
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,680
to take

299
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,640
several uh well a majority of the sans

300
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
forensics

301
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,120
and incident response pro portfolio

302
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,000
classes and i have

303
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,040
a number of certifications from them um

304
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,160
there's endless debates about

305
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,760
certifications as well

306
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,040
and uh my viewpoint on this for the

307
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,640
purposes of this

308
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,839
discussion is you need something to

309
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,360
differentiate you

310
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,279
to say that in the mind of joe public

311
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,320
that you know what you're doing um and

312
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,920
that you can demonstrate that

313
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,760
and at the end of the day having a

314
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,279
certification

315
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,680
uh on your resume that says i am you

316
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,360
know a certified ethical hacker or a

317
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,399
cissp

318
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,360
or you know a certified forensic analyst

319
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,000
um

320
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,920
leads joe public to think that you know

321
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,079
more about that topic than the average

322
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,440
person

323
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,079
um so that's that's really kind of what

324
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,200
matters there

325
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,880
when we get to experience this is

326
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,040
everything that's not education this is

327
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,600
your

328
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,000
your i.t background uh this is you know

329
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,320
you're likely a cyber professional

330
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,200
who has worked their way up through the

331
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,079
ranks or

332
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,920
is in a cyber position that you

333
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,760
came from somewhere maybe you came from

334
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,079
the help desk maybe you came from

335
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,720
network or server background i came from

336
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,800
a sysadmin background myself

337
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,680
that shapes uh kind of the tools that

338
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,959
you have in your toolbox

339
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,160
and in regards to experience uh also

340
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,959
some things

341
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,040
might be like investigative experience

342
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,399
in a lot of ways you know you kind of

343
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,079
have the scientific method that you rely

344
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,240
on as a technician for a lot of things

345
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,279
but the actual investigative process to

346
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,560
go through and

347
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,839
and you know kind of

348
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,320
suss out an investigation in a nice

349
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,000
unbiased way without jumping to

350
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,440
conclusions

351
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,800
is not necessarily something that

352
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,560
everybody has

353
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,639
so that's something you might that might

354
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,240
also get you a leg up or something you

355
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,959
might look to

356
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,079
invest in also in here is is

357
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,320
something that i think kind of really

358
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,760
well ties in so

359
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,040
uh leslie carhart um on twitter is

360
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,240
someone who i i follow and she recently

361
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,680
put out a tweet at the beginning of this

362
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,160
month

363
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,959
a thread of tweets kind of talking about

364
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:07,360
her

365
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,360
thoughts on people starting in dfir

366
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,200
and i thought it was it really

367
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,959
summarized a lot of the points that i

368
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,480
wanted to hit on well

369
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,399
um i encourage you to go check out her

370
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,760
twitter

371
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,959
her profile and those tweets back from

372
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,160
october 8th

373
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,720
i didn't want to include them here but

374
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,480
they talk about a lot of these kinds of

375
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,240
things a lot of the diverse background

376
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,680
that is needed for these types of

377
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,600
activities

378
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,519
finally get into attributes and

379
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,800
attributes are

380
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,240
you as a person but also your

381
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,920
happenstance so

382
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,959
uh when when we're hiring um

383
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,519
at my current position at my current

384
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,880
place of employment

385
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,399
one of the things that we look for is

386
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,000
drive and motivation that's not

387
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,199
something that is

388
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,800
easy to grow or build in a person

389
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,199
um if they don't choose to do it

390
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,160
themselves

391
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,079
so we look for somebody who wants to do

392
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,240
the home labs who wants to do those ctfs

393
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,639
who wants to go self-study who wants to

394
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,720
you know grow and grow and grow we want

395
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,240
somebody with strong ethics because

396
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,600
everything we deal with is highly

397
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,480
sensitive

398
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,680
um or has some some sort of you know

399
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,639
issue to it

400
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,480
uh you know there's there's something

401
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,399
i've actually left off this slide which

402
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,760
is kind of grit

403
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,360
dfir professionals often deal with um

404
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,240
you know not the most upstanding people

405
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,279
and

406
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,560
uh we deal with a lot of material that

407
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,000
you know people don't want to deal with

408
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,360
so that flexibility i know that

409
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,839
i don't get to choose my cases if i did

410
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,199
there would be a lot less of them at

411
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,240
friday

412
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,440
friday afternoon at 4 30 and i wouldn't

413
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,279
be going on as many car trips and plane

414
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,880
trips on saturday morning

415
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,079
um to edges of the state

416
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,360
to to kind of you know do my deal

417
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,880
um that if i did that and i had

418
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,639
say kids and things like that you know

419
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,720
or a rigid home life or

420
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,800
a very strict schedule that would be

421
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,399
very difficult for me to do

422
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,120
and uh and so flexibility isn't just a

423
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,079
it's not just a be

424
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,560
flexible it's also making sure that you

425
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,440
know you as a

426
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,199
person and where you are in your life

427
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,760
can can be flexible to the

428
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,519
the often unpredictable schedule that is

429
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,320
dfire works

430
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,760
and then finally we get to that tools

431
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,440
the traditional tools

432
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,880
uh the hardware the software um so let's

433
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,360
let's jump into a couple of those uh

434
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,160
this here

435
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,839
is a list of all open source and free

436
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:38,959
software

437
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,079
um and tools and resources um

438
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,000
this is not the slick sheet slick sheets

439
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,160
separate um

440
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,000
but i use every single case i work on

441
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,240
will involve at least one of these tools

442
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,120
um

443
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,600
so i encourage that if you are

444
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,959
interested in getting into this and

445
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,480
you're like how do i get started where

446
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,680
do i go

447
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,639
how do i uh how do i get to the next

448
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,519
level

449
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,160
um i think that going and being familiar

450
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,680
with these tools downloading them using

451
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,199
them there's tutorials all over the

452
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,800
place

453
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,440
will get you in a position to better be

454
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,800
able to do

455
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,880
this type of work it'll be it'll make

456
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
you ready these are tools that are used

457
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
in the industry

458
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,199
and there's nothing wrong with them um

459
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,560
you don't need you know a big

460
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,040
expensive end case license or a big

461
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,120
expensive suite license

462
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,160
um to to do forensics so uh

463
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,320
get familiar with these uh as far as

464
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,199
scripting

465
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,639
i'm i'm on the python powershell camp

466
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,839
uh i there's so many things for that now

467
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,079
that it's such a pat those two are so

468
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,600
powerful languages

469
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,399
that uh i that's that's what i spend

470
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,680
most of my time doing i know there's

471
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,720
holy wars

472
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,000
over this type of stuff but

473
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,360
um and then we i often get asked what's

474
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,560
my go bag

475
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,600
all about um what

476
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,559
what do i take with me when i go you

477
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,880
know fly or drive or whatever

478
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,400
and so i took a picture of this and uh

479
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,240
kind of all the contents spilled out all

480
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,599
over the place

481
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,520
and well you know there's things missing

482
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,199
from this picture there's no laptop i

483
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,319
usually have a

484
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,000
usually a high-powered dell precision

485
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,760
workstation that i use

486
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,559
um that's a that's a laptop i also have

487
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,760
a desktop in my lab

488
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,240
there's there's not a lot of tech here

489
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,600
in this pile

490
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,840
and it's because when i'm out doing

491
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,760
things when i'm doing collections

492
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,320
uh to then bring back and process in in

493
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,480
my in my environment

494
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,200
the it's it's not necessarily all about

495
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,080
the tech

496
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,559
um a lot of times i'm collecting things

497
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,480
preserving it for later i'm taking it

498
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,600
and bringing it back

499
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,679
um you know i'm not gonna sit in an

500
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,120
office in rigby

501
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,080
for you know however many hours sitting

502
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,600
there trying to chew through something

503
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,240
when i could

504
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,000
just as easily pick it up and bring it

505
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,970
back

506
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,559
[Music]

507
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,400
so it's a lot of process oriented stuff

508
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,559
i got i have you know different office

509
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,000
supplies here

510
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,720
some of the most important part that i i

511
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,520
have in this

512
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,640
is extra log books and blank forms um

513
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,000
we log all of our cases case notes

514
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,520
uh in a one notebook per uh per case

515
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,480
format

516
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,039
and each one of those log books then

517
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,880
gets stored with a case folder with all

518
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,360
the paperwork in it

519
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,160
that's really really important to us

520
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,760
also we've got some evidence bags some

521
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,960
anti-static

522
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,360
i have an anti-static mat and some

523
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,480
people might think

524
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,320
why on earth would i have that am i

525
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,240
tearing apart phones in the field

526
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,280
um honestly there's times where just

527
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,400
someone you know i work in an

528
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,080
engineering organization itd's an

529
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,160
engineering organization

530
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,080
you walk in and someone's desk is just

531
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,679
absolutely coated with stacks and stacks

532
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:54,480
of paper

533
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,160
so it might be easier if i need to

534
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,360
photograph things which i'm

535
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,799
photographing all the time my phone's

536
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,080
not in this picture but

537
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
i'm photographing the scene all the time

538
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,440
um to lay out a mat or something that i

539
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:05,919
don't

540
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,840
compromise you know data that might be

541
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,360
on those papers and i'm disturbing the

542
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,000
scene as little

543
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,640
as possible

544
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,039
other things will be supplemented into

545
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,640
this kit as

546
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,360
as time goes on depending on the case

547
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,799
depending on what i need to do i might

548
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,880
take extra write blockers extra hard

549
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,720
drives i might do other stuff but

550
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,400
this is the this is the kit that usually

551
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,080
goes everywhere on every single case

552
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,520
so that we've kind of talked about the

553
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,440
tools and uh and that

554
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,200
kind of what the right tools are

555
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,520
and uh kind of talking about

556
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,360
how how we can cut you know just some

557
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,120
different ideas and things you might be

558
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,240
able to exploit or kind of work on

559
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,600
um then let's kind of talk about this

560
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,799
come back to this equation thing so

561
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,200
again we're trying to get a leg up on

562
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,799
well not a leg up but we're trying to

563
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,760
make up the gap

564
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,799
between um us and and and law

565
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:03,440
enforcement

566
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,000
military dod and so we're getting that

567
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,240
right place right time and right tools

568
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,640
well the the key to remember is that

569
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,120
these are not guaranteeing

570
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,919
success they are putting you in a

571
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,360
position to take advantage of

572
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,440
opportunities

573
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,919
and those opportunities an example of

574
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:22,640
that for me

575
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,000
was uh when i uh one of the cases i

576
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,880
worked on

577
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,000
um we found some suspicious stuff on

578
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,919
a workstation and we needed to figure

579
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,720
out what was going on with it

580
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,880
and so we went to management and

581
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,760
notified them

582
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,400
management gave us three directives uh

583
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:40,960
one

584
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,039
be quiet about it keep it keep it under

585
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,000
wraps

586
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,280
two this is your highest priority

587
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,400
and three uh keep investigating we're

588
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:50,799
not

589
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,240
really sure that we want to do anything

590
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,960
about it yet but keep investigating

591
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,000
and uh let us know what you find

592
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,320
so we kept digging over the course of a

593
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,840
couple days

594
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,320
my you know a couple people and i

595
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:04,960
started

596
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,720
riffling through things we kept hitting

597
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,200
brick walls answering one question

598
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,400
is this malicious and while it was

599
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,280
suspicious

600
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,159
and it was it was kind of strange we

601
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,640
couldn't

602
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,000
say it was actually malicious so

603
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,600
what i did is um one evening

604
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,520
we uh we kind of you know after another

605
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,200
defeated evening

606
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,799
i grabbed a copy of it i came home

607
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,400
spun it up in a virtual environment i

608
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
had a book that i had

609
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,480
on malware analysis that i picked up a

610
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,039
year ago i'm not a malware analyst

611
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,200
uh i know i've done some basic static

612
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,080
analysis but nothing super major

613
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,480
so instead i spent six and a half hours

614
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,080
walking through labs

615
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,640
and going through that book and pushing

616
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,320
through and trying to kind of teach

617
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,120
myself

618
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,000
to do some super super basic malware

619
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,280
analysis to just

620
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,039
answer the question is this malicious or

621
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,480
not

622
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,720
and we found the answer i found that it

623
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,320
had no business being on the network or

624
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,080
the systems that it was on

625
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,440
and uh i wrote up my findings and

626
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,679
i sent off that email at like 6 30 in

627
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,880
the morning

628
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,400
and when i went to bed

629
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,080
got a call about an hour later from my

630
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,159
manager saying hey

631
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,360
we have a phone call in an hour

632
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,440
where we're going to present we need you

633
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,120
to present your your findings

634
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,480
uh so make your way to the office and

635
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,919
i showed up and we did the conference

636
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,559
call

637
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,880
and we got that green light to get in

638
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,960
extra help and get extra resources which

639
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,159
is what we've been

640
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,120
the nut we've been trying to crack and

641
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,080
we were also

642
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,159
all right we also were given a war room

643
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,000
to continue to work out of

644
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,039
um this of course it gained priority and

645
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,320
uh and i promptly found the war room and

646
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,039
uh

647
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,200
laid along the wall and slept for a few

648
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,480
hours um

649
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,159
with management's permission of course

650
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,600
but uh

651
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,440
the point was i was presented an

652
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
opportunity to try and

653
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,520
answer a question to learn something to

654
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,840
to figure out the problem and

655
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,440
you know we couldn't escalate there was

656
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,360
that barrier that until we got enough

657
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,919
information we couldn't escalate

658
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,200
so um you know we break that barrier

659
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,320
and spend that effort to turn that

660
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,120
opportunity

661
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,240
into into a success where we can move

662
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,159
that ball forward

663
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,840
and that's really kind of what this is

664
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,600
about is

665
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,159
find putting yourself in the right place

666
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,159
at the right time with the right tools

667
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,559
to be able to get that opportunity and

668
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,559
be ready to actually exploit it and turn

669
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,000
it into something

670
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,360
that you can then grow from

671
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,000
and you can expand on just time and time

672
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,080
and time again

673
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,840
so with that um

674
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,720
thanks for for sitting through this and

675
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,320
uh

676
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,600
thanks eric and xin ming for for hosting

677
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,200
this and i'm

678
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,880
happy to answer any questions the last

679
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,279
couple minutes here hey josh yes thank

680
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,279
you we do have a couple of questions

681
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:13,760
here

682
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,320
in the chat so yeah thank you great

683
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,080
presentation i enjoyed the cat

684
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,400
in the background too so that was a good

685
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,919
audience with you right there

686
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,200
um first question in the channel

687
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,480
is you referred in the slides earlier

688
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,480
to one really important part how

689
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,840
important is attitude

690
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,520
so the attitude it it's really kind of

691
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,440
up to you to make it what you will if

692
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,200
you choose to just say

693
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,080
you know if you choose to have a

694
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,640
defeatist attitude where you're like uh

695
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,080
you know whatever then that's probably

696
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,080
what your outcome's going to be

697
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,000
you really kind of have to be you know

698
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,080
looking up and looking out

699
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,520
and you know you kind of i mean it some

700
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,360
of it's like you got to like your job

701
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,679
um i if you don't like this line of work

702
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,120
you know you're not well it's true with

703
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,240
everything if you don't really like

704
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,679
doing it then you're not gonna be your

705
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:08,880
best

706
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,760
and so having that positive attitude

707
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,440
having that positive outlook and really

708
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,000
reaching

709
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,240
for um whatever it is that you're

710
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,400
you know whatever you're facing as a

711
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,159
challenge

712
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,000
is is vitally important

713
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
that's really good advice in information

714
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,440
security it's not always

715
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,880
all roses right um another question

716
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,279
another question here is you mentioned

717
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,559
quite a bit about some

718
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,760
really good tools some different tooling

719
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,240
i guess for the novice what tools would

720
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,600
you start out with

721
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,200
if you are new to security tooling

722
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,080
um so so dfir specifically i mean i'm

723
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,559
i'm

724
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,679
primarily focused on the forensic side

725
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,679
i do i mean of course i do ir as well

726
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,360
i'm proficient in it but

727
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,159
um most of my time is spent in the

728
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,159
investigation phase

729
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,360
uh so for a lot of that it

730
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,480
like i do a lot of content review and so

731
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,240
throwing something into autopsy which is

732
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,400
a windows-based application and doing

733
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,799
doing content review is kind of a good

734
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,320
way to sort of get your feet wet

735
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,880
and realize just how much data how much

736
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,600
volume there is to data

737
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,120
um that's that's kind of how i sort of

738
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,480
uh got started i guess you know when

739
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,480
when we had stuff going on

740
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,159
and management was like we need this to

741
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,000
happen and i was like well

742
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,080
i got this tool i guess we can give it a

743
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,520
whirl um

744
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,039
that was you know before i really had

745
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,480
any formal training that's kind of how

746
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:40,799
we

747
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,679
how we went about it so it is sort of a

748
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,559
push button

749
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,000
more so than a lot of people would

750
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,919
approve of and i think

751
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,080
when you start out that's kind of okay

752
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,000
right until you can get some training

753
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,480
and get some experience or find a mentor

754
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,840
who can really

755
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,240
guide you into the depths of forensics

756
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,360
to where you're not

757
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,440
looking for a push button solution

758
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,200
you're really looking at understanding

759
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,039
all of the artifacts and and what they

760
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,799
truly mean at kind of the most

761
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,919
raw levels all right

762
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,000
excellent yeah very good very good with

763
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,520
the tooling i think we got

764
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,400
time for one last question and this is a

765
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,000
really good question

766
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,919
and it is do you find yourself

767
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,840
experiencing any burnout

768
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,960
in this field of cyber security uh

769
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,360
absolutely um yeah i deal with burnout a

770
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,480
lot unfortunately

771
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,080
i wanted to watch the presentation just

772
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,679
before mine here in track two

773
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,679
it sounded like a fantastic presentation

774
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,679
but uh you know prepping for this as

775
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:36,559
well as

776
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,320
um you know kind of doing some of the

777
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,480
the the back end work

778
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,159
um here i couldn't i couldn't pay as

779
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,919
much attention as i wanted to

780
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,320
uh yeah burnouts burn it's a very real

781
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:46,960
deal

782
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,279
um especially in this arena there's kind

783
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,320
of a

784
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,520
i don't want to call it a joke but

785
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,240
there's kind of this uh

786
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,120
stigma that um you once you get into

787
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,600
like

788
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,440
hardcore doing forensics like you're

789
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,520
gonna do it for like two or three years

790
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,360
and either you'll make it or you won't

791
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,720
um and it's it's not that you know

792
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,159
you'll fail it's just you'll probably

793
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,919
just decide it's not for you

794
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,159
um it can be very procedural it can be

795
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,000
very boring at times

796
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,640
um you know it's i when i had first

797
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,320
experienced it was just collection

798
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,159
and i did no analysis i just sat there

799
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,760
and stared at a hard drive copying for

800
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,919
four hours it was like wow

801
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,240
um now it's you know it's different

802
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,919
there's a lot more to it

803
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,880
and the the hours can also wear on you

804
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,080
the content can wear

805
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,840
on you um you know you just

806
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,080
you just kind of you have all the

807
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,200
pressures that you do with cyber

808
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,240
security

809
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,360
but you don't get any control about

810
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,279
deciding what it is you decide what you

811
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,880
want to work on for the day

812
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,120
as much it's it's your schedule is

813
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,080
dictated by

814
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,960
the actions of others largely yeah i

815
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,159
guess that's a good point so

816
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,559
just one related part to that question

817
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,240
do you find

818
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,279
that you then maybe

819
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,279
volunteer for some other projects kind

820
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,720
of for some a little

821
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,760
different thing to do yeah

822
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,840
it's it's kind of important to break it

823
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,039
up a little bit

824
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,760
um i still do even in my team where i'm

825
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,640
specialized

826
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,559
i still step out and do some security

827
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,279
consulting in general for projects or

828
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,120
work on some compliance things every now

829
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,720
and again just to kind of keep my

830
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,279
skills up in other areas it's it's

831
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,360
important to be well-rounded when you're

832
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,200
when you even though you specialize it's

833
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,480
important to be well-rounded

834
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,200
so um i think that's you know that's

835
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,240
it's important

836
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,640
so like b-sides i'm involved in b-sides

837
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,240
i'm involved in some other groups in

838
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,799
regard i'm president for infragard

839
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,760
for this year and it's important that

840
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,240
you find

841
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,720
other things to to help disperse and

842
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,520
help deal with some of that burnout
