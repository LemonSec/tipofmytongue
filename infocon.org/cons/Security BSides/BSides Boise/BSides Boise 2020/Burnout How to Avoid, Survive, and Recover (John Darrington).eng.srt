am excited to be here my name is john

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,640
darrington

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,960
i'm a software engineer i have been my

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,160
entire career and

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,559
have been down in the trenches and more

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,079
most recently up in the project

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,399
management and architecting land

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,760
um it's my goal today

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,760
that after this talk we're able to

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,520
recognize what burnout is and if we're

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,520
suffering from it or have suffered from

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,239
it

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,719
and that we are motivated afterwards to

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,520
avoid it

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,920
or to survive we're if we're kind of

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,680
caught in the middle here

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,160
burnout to me is an extremely important

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,600
topic it's the reason i

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,519
quit my last job and actually started my

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,920
own company third house software

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,520
and it it is even more prevalent now

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,479
that we're in the middle of this

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,400
pandemic the outside stressors with

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,720
regards to you know political climate

35
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,280
and things of that nature burnout is

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,520
becoming more and more prevalent

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,200
one of the biggest hurdles i have to

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,280
often overcome when talking about

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,400
burnout is

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,240
helping under helping people understand

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,720
that it's real in the first place

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,079
and it's real enough that the mayo

43
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,759
clinic has an entire section of their

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,400
site dedicated to job burnout and they

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,200
say

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,360
that job burnout is a special type of

47
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,119
work related stress

48
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,799
a state of physical or emotional

49
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,040
exhaustion that also involves a sense of

50
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,399
reduced accomplishment

51
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,880
and loss of personal identity now

52
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,040
there's a lot to unpack there in that

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,920
sentence

54
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,000
but the biggest takeaway that we need to

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,960
have is that burnout is not a disease

56
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,360
it's not something you catch like a cold

57
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,439
burnout is a state of being it's a state

58
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,759
of physical or emotional being

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,799
and that's hallmarked by exhaustion loss

60
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,239
of personal identity loss of

61
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,520
accomplishment

62
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,360
but that's what burnout is and there's a

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,560
lot of different symptoms

64
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,520
for burnout when we're talking about it

65
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,080
the first

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,879
is becoming cynical or critical work now

67
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,480
i think there is a

68
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,560
healthy level of cynicism and criticism

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,800
that it can exist in the workplace

70
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,879
and i think most anyone who's out of the

71
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,680
honeymoon stage of uh position is going

72
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,239
to experience that and that's okay

73
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,480
it's when cynicism and criticism and

74
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,000
these other symptoms we'll talk about

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,160
become all-encompassing where you're

76
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,040
cynical about

77
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,400
everything about the mission of the

78
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
company the company itself the people

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
inside the company your job

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,760
it's when that becomes all-encompassing

81
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,720
that it becomes a big issue

82
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,840
this one's becoming a little more

83
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,200
prevalent now that we're working from

84
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,360
home it can be hard to start

85
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,879
uh when you don't have uh a good

86
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,879
separation between the time you leave

87
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,239
for work you know you have a

88
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,760
your time to leave you have your commute

89
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
and then you're in work and it's this

90
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,319
whole little ritual

91
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,800
um that's changed now for a lot of

92
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,000
individuals that are now working

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,280
remotely when they haven't

94
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,040
before and that can be a symptom is

95
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,480
if it's hard to get started at work

96
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,360
hard to concentrate all right sorry have

97
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,879
you become irritable or impatient with

98
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,400
co-workers and again

99
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,280
this is all-encompassing this is not a

100
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,920
simple

101
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,879
bad day you know here and there or just

102
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,360
uh

103
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,959
you know not a terribly sunny

104
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,480
disposition to begin with

105
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,400
this is all encompassing where even the

106
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,599
little things can get you going

107
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,280
when we talk about lack of energy we're

108
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,200
not talking about

109
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,640
the coffee you need in the morning to

110
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,120
get going or that post-afternoon slump

111
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,000
you have after

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,239
you have a good dinner or a good lunch

113
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,239
we're talking about a consistent lack of

114
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,000
energy that no matter how much you sleep

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,480
how much you eat no matter what you do

116
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,400
you don't have the energy you need to

117
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
keep working

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,040
my last position i found myself

119
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
sleeping in my car for at least 40

120
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,319
minutes out of the day

121
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,920
in order to have the energy that i

122
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,680
needed to keep going it's a very big

123
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,519
very big symptom hard to concentrate

124
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,360
this is one of the hallmark symptoms of

125
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,280
job burnout do you lack satisfaction

126
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,959
from your achievements

127
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,279
can you have a hard time at the end of

128
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,000
the day

129
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,759
looking back on what you've accomplished

130
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,120
and saying you know what i did a good

131
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,759
job

132
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,240
or i did a job you know i i worked i did

133
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,320
this look at all the stuff i did or was

134
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,600
able to accomplish

135
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,960
if you can't do that and you

136
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,720
consistently can't do that that is a

137
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,520
symptom of job burnout

138
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,680
another symptom is bad coping mechanisms

139
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,280
such as drugs or alcohol or

140
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,320
food you can abuse food one of

141
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,600
the trends we'll see in burnout often is

142
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,199
weight gain in the in as we continue to

143
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,880
use food in other ways to help us feel

144
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,160
better

145
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,759
sleep habits change now this

146
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,520
might seem a little bit interesting

147
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,960
until you realize

148
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,440
that or tell you except first that job

149
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,440
burnout's a state of being stressed

150
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,280
it's a it's a specific kind of stress

151
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,280
but it's a state of stress

152
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,759
and stress our bodies are not designed

153
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,919
to stay in that state for long periods

154
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:14,479
of time

155
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,199
and it causes physical problems for that

156
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,520
it causes physical consequences such as

157
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,600
well it compounds whatever other stress

158
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,240
we're suffering in our lives um

159
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
fatigue again that tiredness we talked

160
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,360
about before

161
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,759
insomnia having a hard time sleeping or

162
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,960
staying asleep

163
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,639
sadness anger irritability again this is

164
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,639
irritability that just the smallest

165
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,520
thing can set you off and get you going

166
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,840
misuse of alcohol or substances heart

167
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,600
disease high blood pressure

168
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,160
type 2 diabetes now these are serious

169
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,800
issues

170
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,759
i i hope that it highlights how serious

171
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,919
staying in a state of burnout can be

172
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,600
how serious staying in a state of high

173
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,680
stress can be our bodies are not

174
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,600
designed to handle that

175
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,680
and because of that they start to break

176
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,039
down and we start to

177
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,319
suffer these things these have been

178
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,639
shown to happen in

179
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,560
states of high stress i hope that we've

180
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,240
covered the symptoms well enough if we

181
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,520
have more questions at the end please

182
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,880
feel free to ask

183
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,800
um there are more symptoms these are

184
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,479
just some of the big ones

185
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,280
um and remember that job burnout can be

186
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,880
caused by more than just job and we'll

187
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,880
talk about that more in just a minute

188
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,240
now that we know how serious the

189
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,080
consequences are however i think it's

190
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,720
time we talk about how we avoid

191
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,440
job burnout avoiding job burnout

192
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,360
especially now with the outside

193
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,600
stressors such as the pandemic and the

194
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,080
turbulent political atmosphere is not

195
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,960
easy

196
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,880
and success will stem from your

197
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,440
understanding of burnout's causes

198
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,199
we're going to talk about six causes

199
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,759
today and keep in mind that there are

200
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,639
more but what i hope as after this

201
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,080
presentation we'll either talk about

202
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,880
those

203
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,199
or it becomes more of a common sense

204
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,360
kind of a sixth sense that you'll be

205
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,919
able to

206
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,520
hone in understanding what situations do

207
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,639
and do not cause burnout so we'll talk

208
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,319
about causes first we'll talk about lack

209
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,520
of control

210
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,080
so for you work seven to nine hours a

211
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,720
day

212
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,120
uh and sometimes even more than that if

213
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,960
you are not in control for that amount

214
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,080
of time

215
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,120
um that is a large amount of stress

216
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,759
where

217
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,039
very very few people can can

218
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,800
function when they don't feel like

219
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,319
they're in control and if you're not in

220
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,240
control for that much of your day

221
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,160
for that like the in your entirety of

222
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,360
your work day

223
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,319
that could lead to job burnout it also

224
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,360
has to do

225
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,039
with the resources you need to do your

226
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,720
job if you don't have the ability to do

227
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,440
your job

228
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,039
and yet you're still being expected to

229
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,880
do your job that can cause

230
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,680
job burnout as well unclear job

231
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,199
expectations if you remember the

232
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,160
symptoms

233
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,440
we talked about the unable to get a

234
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,280
sense of personal satisfaction or a

235
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,639
sense of achievement from what you've

236
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,000
accomplished

237
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,319
you can't do that in a job where your

238
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,000
expectations are unclear

239
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
if you don't know what your job expects

240
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,560
of you

241
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,490
at any given moment or or

242
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,039
[Music]

243
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,080
what you can and can't do how can you

244
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,160
find that sense of personal satisfaction

245
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,080
and personal achievement you can't you

246
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,240
can't do that at all and so

247
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,639
having those clear job expectations is

248
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,160
all important when it comes to setting

249
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,440
up a stress-free

250
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,400
stress-free environment dysfunctional

251
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,000
workplace dynamics is a fancy

252
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,560
way of saying office politics now office

253
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,000
politics is something that's going to

254
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,759
exist in every job

255
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,440
if you don't think so you're probably

256
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,039
still in the

257
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,120
honeymoon phase in your current position

258
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,240
i guarantee you

259
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,919
every position you'll work will have

260
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,679
some form of office politics it doesn't

261
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,360
have to be bad

262
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,279
but when we get to office politics

263
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,120
they're dysfunctional that are

264
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,360
a constant problem or a constant source

265
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,959
of stress

266
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,000
such as micromanaging or bullying that's

267
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,480
when

268
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,080
office politics becomes a problem and

269
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,720
can become a very big source of stress

270
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,000
and a cause of burnout

271
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,720
now this next cause is one of the the

272
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,480
causes that i struggled with the most

273
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,800
and it's called extremes of activity

274
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,080
when we when we

275
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,240
refer to extremes of activity my

276
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,160
position i was one of the most senior

277
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,320
engineers on the team at the time

278
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,240
and we were an international e-commerce

279
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,480
company and so when we had problems

280
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,160
it was up to the team to obviously solve

281
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,399
those problems and being one of the most

282
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,920
senior members on that team

283
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,680
i was constantly and taking a

284
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,080
disproportionately large amount

285
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,800
of tickets to solve to to help out the

286
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,920
company

287
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,880
and because of that i always felt like i

288
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,839
was on call

289
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,600
i always felt like i had to be ready for

290
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,519
anything um

291
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,279
if i was going on any kind of vacation

292
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,640
even a short trip

293
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,160
um you know three or four hours away i

294
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,279
would have to make sure that i knew

295
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,480
where the internet was

296
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,440
made sure i had my laptop on me and this

297
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,320
constant extreme of energy of needing to

298
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,959
constantly be up and going and ready to

299
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:57,920
go

300
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,920
caused a lot of my personal burnout

301
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,399
social support and social isolation is a

302
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,560
big deal right now in the pandemic

303
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,240
as we practice social distancing

304
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,000
measures we're distancing ourselves from

305
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,920
the people that matter most in our lives

306
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,519
in a lot of cases or we're quarantining

307
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,760
away from them and if we don't have

308
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
methods to cope with that

309
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,279
or we haven't set up things like you

310
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,040
know playing games with them or finding

311
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,839
something to to work around it that

312
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,839
feeling of isolation and lack of social

313
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,600
support can easily grow

314
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
and swamp you and become a big issue

315
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,519
throughout

316
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,160
throughout this time and throughout your

317
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,839
experience with let's say remote working

318
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,839
the last one is work life and balance

319
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,680
now when i talk about work life balance

320
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,040
i don't mean

321
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,360
eight hours on eight hours off and if

322
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,200
you go over eight hours on your work

323
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,120
then you're horribly imbalanced and your

324
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,760
work's

325
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,920
demanding too much of you now what i

326
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,040
mean is if

327
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,519
work does not leave you the time and

328
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,079
energy

329
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,720
you want to spend with your family and

330
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,360
friends

331
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,040
then your work life imbalance is out of

332
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,760
whack again if work takes up too much of

333
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,120
your time and energy

334
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,279
that you don't have any left to spend

335
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,880
with family and friends

336
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,360
it's a very big source of stress and can

337
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,120
easily cause burnout

338
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,320
now if we find ourselves in a state of

339
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,240
burnout if we can't avoid these things

340
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,959
or we've

341
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,160
just haven't thought about them that

342
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,000
much and we find ourselves in a state of

343
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,800
burnout

344
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,440
we have to take a few steps the first

345
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,079
step

346
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,880
in surviving and recovering burnout is

347
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,640
accepting that we are in a state of

348
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,079
burnout

349
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,160
now accepting and that we're in a state

350
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,000
of burnout requires us to get rid of

351
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,079
some of the lies like i'm fine

352
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,200
i love my job i'm happy to take more on

353
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,440
um you don't understand no one else can

354
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,040
do this this was one of the

355
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,760
the biggest lies that i told myself as a

356
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,360
senior developer i was

357
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,040
i was a senior developer i was one that

358
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,959
knew the systems very well

359
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,880
no one else could possibly solve these

360
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,320
tickets other than me

361
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,240
and that lie constantly kept me in a

362
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,079
sense and in a state of stress

363
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,440
and doing more than i that i ought to

364
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,279
um people are depending on me

365
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,200
i want to be helpful i'll be fine once

366
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,399
this is done

367
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,040
now this two will pass and i will be

368
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
fine once this is done

369
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,800
um just seem to seem to we try to

370
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
convince ourselves that burnout is a

371
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,399
temporary state

372
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,720
and that it's just gonna go away if we

373
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,000
don't do anything

374
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,519
and that couldn't be farther from the

375
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,079
truth burnout is not a temporary state

376
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,839
and it's not gonna go away if we don't

377
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,440
do anything

378
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,839
things outside things may change and

379
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,440
that may help burn out

380
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,040
but it's not just going to go away if we

381
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,880
don't do anything

382
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,120
i need to get back to the top of my game

383
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
i'll take a vacation and then be okay

384
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,800
i think this one is what a lot of people

385
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,279
hold on to they have a vacation coming

386
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,639
up and so they're willing to suffer

387
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,000
through a lot more than they

388
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,399
they need to or should in order to go on

389
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,480
a vacation and unfortunately

390
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,360
a five to ten day vacation or even even

391
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,279
a longer vacation than that

392
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,440
is not going to remove the stressors in

393
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,279
your life that led you to a state of

394
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,959
burnout in the first place

395
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,440
it's going to give you a break but who

396
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,880
knows how well you're even going to be

397
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,639
able to enjoy that vacation if you're in

398
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,920
a state of burnout

399
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,680
so it's important to note that these

400
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,040
lies are things that we tell ourselves

401
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,600
that we have to overcome first in order

402
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,200
to get out of a state of burnout we have

403
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,560
to accept

404
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,320
that we are in a state of burnout and we

405
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,399
need to get out

406
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,519
so we'll get back through this so when

407
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,200
we talk about handling burnout

408
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,040
our first and biggest step is to

409
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,959
evaluate our options

410
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,160
if you can write down everything that

411
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,000
you feel is causing you stress and how

412
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
you feel about it i would write down in

413
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,040
my case

414
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
that i'm constantly on call and i feel

415
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,199
like i can't enjoy myself i lose time

416
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,800
with friends and family my work life and

417
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,320
balance is out of whack

418
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,600
those are things that i would have

419
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,880
written down and should have written

420
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,760
down

421
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
and then bring those to your supervisor

422
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,680
if you're in a functional workplace that

423
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,000
that

424
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,720
works now i obviously i understand that

425
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,959
in some cases this is not the right move

426
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,360
you might not be able to

427
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,600
talk to your supervisor because they

428
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
might be part of the bigger problem

429
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,079
in that case maybe look at talking to hr

430
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,519
or

431
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,519
going to your next option which is

432
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,240
finding social support outside

433
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,880
of outside of your actual workplace

434
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,079
so finding social support in the eyes of

435
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,680
friends and loved ones

436
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,560
you know talking to your spouse or

437
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,639
partner about what you're going through

438
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,279
finding support in programs that can

439
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,040
really really help you out

440
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,120
one thing that i see a lot of people not

441
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,320
take advantage of

442
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,440
is in a lot of cases employee insurance

443
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,399
programs

444
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,639
have free counseling or at least a

445
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,320
couple of sessions of free counseling

446
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,079
with regards to

447
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,720
workplace stress and workplace dynamics

448
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,279
i would

449
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,040
talk to whoever runs your insurance

450
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,920
usually hr to find out if your insurance

451
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
has something like that if you have a

452
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
few free counseling sessions that you

453
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,680
can take advantage of

454
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,760
to find a support group or find somebody

455
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,160
that's going to help you

456
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,399
another way to handle burnout is to try

457
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,279
relaxing activities now

458
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,120
when i say relaxing activities i'm

459
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,959
talking about activities that

460
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,000
change your state of mind or body

461
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,959
remember that that burnout is being in a

462
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,959
certain state of mind and body being in

463
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,399
that stress state

464
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,560
well try to find activities that take

465
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,480
you out of that stress state or take you

466
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,560
out of that state of mind

467
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,040
yoga and meditation are big ones tai chi

468
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,959
practicing

469
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,560
mindfulness which we'll talk about in a

470
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,040
minute are all extremely important ways

471
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,320
of handling

472
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,480
uh burnout these are called coping

473
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,360
mechanisms

474
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,759
coping mechanisms are just strategies

475
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,480
that we use to handle stress or trauma

476
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,320
and there are certain coping mechanisms

477
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,920
like we talked about

478
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,000
just now with the relaxing activities

479
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,519
seeking support changing

480
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,839
kind of your environment that help more

481
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,519
with burnout than others

482
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,600
there are negative coping mechanisms out

483
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,680
there such as the abuse of alcohol and

484
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,480
substances

485
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,680
the abuse of food we talked about that

486
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,440
my coping mechanism of sleeping in my

487
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,040
car was not helpful

488
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,880
in fact it harmed me it took me away

489
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,160
from work longer than i should and it

490
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,680
didn't actually help

491
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,120
but it was the only coping mechanism i

492
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,199
knew how to use at the moment and so

493
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,639
we have all these different coping

494
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,560
mechanisms that we kind of

495
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,360
cobble together we have to approach

496
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,320
coping with

497
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,199
job burnout more methodically and more

498
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,639
like a developer

499
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,560
more like a programmer more like you

500
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,560
know more like our profession in

501
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,440
approaching this problem as a problem to

502
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,320
solve

503
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,079
instead of something just to suffer

504
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,399
through

505
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,399
if we're talking about more burnout

506
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,759
we're talking about more coping

507
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,800
mechanisms

508
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,279
we're talking about exercise again we're

509
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:55,839
changing

510
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,120
our physical state and my mental state

511
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,880
and we're hopefully reversing some of

512
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,560
the effects that long-term stress can

513
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,759
have on our body

514
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,599
that's what we hope to accomplish when

515
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,919
we're attempting to go through exercise

516
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,119
is just changing our body and changing

517
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,880
changing the state that we're sitting in

518
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,640
sleep is probably one of the most

519
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,119
important things that you can do

520
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,319
to combat burnout if you can

521
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,760
divide sorry if you can find

522
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,079
your sleep time and guard it with your

523
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,039
life

524
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,120
set up you know set up alarms set up

525
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,559
make sure that where you're sleeping is

526
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,600
dark and quiet

527
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,799
make sure that you're not going to be

528
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,039
interrupted go to bed early if you need

529
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:37,760
to

530
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,000
uh you might you might miss out on some

531
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,840
things but it's better to be in a state

532
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,080
of

533
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,120
mental and and physical health than and

534
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,559
miss out on a few things than

535
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,360
necessarily lose sleep and cause that to

536
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,080
become

537
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,840
more of a problem the last

538
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,919
way i would talk about today of

539
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:56,880
combating

540
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,400
me of combating uh burnout is practicing

541
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,840
mindfulness

542
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,080
mindfulness is very simple it's just

543
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,880
well the the act itself isn't simple

544
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,360
but the definition is it's just focusing

545
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,240
on

546
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,799
yourself and being intensely aware of

547
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,720
what you're sensing and feeling at any

548
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,559
given time

549
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,720
if you're practicing mindfulness you're

550
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,320
able to look at situations

551
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,480
from an objective point of view and to

552
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,360
see them

553
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,600
like you're standing outside of yourself

554
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,120
there's an excellent book called search

555
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,000
inside yourself

556
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,600
it was written by one of google's most

557
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,039
early engineers

558
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,000
that talks a lot about mindfulness in a

559
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,240
in a software engineering world

560
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,679
and i highly recommend it as a source of

561
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,360
truth when it comes down to mindfulness

562
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,760
in the workplace

563
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,880
burnout is not permanent it's not a

564
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,559
permanent state it's not going to go

565
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,200
away

566
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,480
just by not doing anything but it can

567
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,120
be beaten you can fight back against

568
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,200
burnout we talked about some coping

569
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,320
mechanisms today

570
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,080
i think if you think about it you can

571
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,600
find what's stressing you

572
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,000
and find the opposite of your stressor

573
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,919
if i'm constantly on call well then the

574
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,679
opposite of constantly being on call is

575
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,600
not being constantly on call

576
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,880
so finding the option to you know to

577
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,960
take a rest week or to only be on weekly

578
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,240
or something along those lines would

579
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,039
have helped

580
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:20,400
immensely these are these are different

581
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,919
mechanisms that we can use to get out of

582
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:22,799
burnout

583
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,960
burnout is not a disease it's a state of

584
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,400
mind and being in a state of mind and

585
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,799
being that can be changed

586
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,400
um thank you so much for giving me the

587
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
option opportunity to present this to

588
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,760
you i hope that

589
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,320
by by today we're able to recognize if

590
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,080
you're suffering from burnout

591
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,039
and if so able to get yourself out of it

592
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:41,360
and

593
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,000
and find a way to to cope with that

594
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,480
health

595
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,280
in a healthy way in a healthy way so

596
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,880
let's go ahead and open it up to any

597
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,320
questions that we may have gotten and

598
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,280
throughout the uh

599
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,000
the presentation all right we've got one

600
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,799
question

601
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,919
came through uh he quit judah burned out

602
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,360
to start his own company

603
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,039
but doesn't starting your own company

604
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,880
potentially involve a lot of stress and

605
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,720
long hours

606
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,600
yes it absolutely does that's why the

607
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,799
nuclear method of

608
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,880
quitting your job might not be the right

609
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,480
way of handling burnout

610
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,400
for me i thought it was going to be the

611
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,480
midas touch it was going to be i quit my

612
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,360
job and suddenly everything's hunky-dory

613
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,440
um i can go do my own thing now you know

614
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,880
do my own contracting work and

615
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,320
everything's going to be fine and what i

616
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,280
found

617
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,760
is that the same stressors that i was

618
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,760
facing at my workplace

619
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,919
i found that inside my own company as

620
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,400
well and i've had to learn how to cope

621
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,960
with those

622
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,440
those things on my own whereas maybe

623
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,960
before i would have had more help

624
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,360
and in a different situation so you're

625
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,120
absolutely right starting my own company

626
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,360
led to a whole new set of stressors

627
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,720
and some of the ones i was already

628
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,799
suffering with and coping with

629
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,720
things in a nuclear method such as

630
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,159
quitting um

631
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,799
might not be the proper way to handle

632
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,120
things

633
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,919
i'll just throw in no i'll throw in a

634
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:00,880
question

635
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,480
did taking the nuclear method actually

636
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,520
send you off the rails

637
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,440
what do you mean send me off the house

638
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,280
stress you out

639
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,679
and and all that like did it give you

640
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,320
burnout

641
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,679
not doing something or

642
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,039
because there is there as well

643
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,159
yeah in in the beginning when i first

644
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,840
came to the conclusion of quitting it

645
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,280
like i said it seemed like the midas

646
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,720
touch and so

647
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,880
for the first little bit it kind of gave

648
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,840
me a boost

649
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,000
like like this kind of like leg up and

650
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,080
suddenly you know nothing seemed as bad

651
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,600
anymore and you know the company was

652
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,640
gonna be great and everything's gonna be

653
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,440
hunky-dory

654
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,679
kind of it put me in the honeymoon phase

655
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,880
is what it did

656
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,360
um but like i said it didn't take very

657
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,039
long to get back to the same kind of

658
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,000
stressors that i was facing at my job

659
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
at my own company and doing my own thing

660
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,159
so it

661
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,640
it helped a little bit but not in the

662
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,679
long run and i think that's what it

663
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,880
comes down to and i think that's what

664
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,720
coping mechanisms come down to

665
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,320
you might find a coping mechanism that

666
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,039
helps you uh temporarily such as

667
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,640
you know alcohol you know drinking

668
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,320
yourself to sleep every night but

669
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,000
in the long run it's going to do more

670
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,679
damage than it does good

671
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,840
and quitting my job could have done more

672
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,440
damage in the long run

673
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,360
than than trying to figure out how to

674
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,200
make it work

675
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,880
fair enough um question is uh do you

676
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,400
think men in particular struggle

677
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,480
more with asking for help or seeking

678
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,039
counseling

679
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,400
i personally think so yes i think

680
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,880
our culture focuses on a masculinity

681
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,840
that

682
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,280
promotes self-you know self-control and

683
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,559
self-containment

684
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,520
self-control is a wrong word

685
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,799
self-containment is probably a better

686
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,679
word for that

687
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,679
so i i do think that men have a much

688
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,280
harder time reaching out and saying hey

689
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,520
you know what i'm struggling with this

690
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,000
especially if it can be viewed as

691
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,440
anything that would make them seem

692
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,400
lesser

693
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,039
um software engineers i see and and this

694
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,720
is for both men and women

695
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,880
i see constantly struggle with a sense

696
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,559
of burnout because

697
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,320
they can't stop and say you know this is

698
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,919
too much for me because that makes them

699
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,600
look bad in the eyes of their peers if

700
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,960
you can't handle this

701
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,120
then who knows you know are are you

702
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,159
supposed to be here

703
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,440
you know a little bit of imposter

704
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,520
syndrome so absolutely i

705
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,159
i do think men struggle with it more but

706
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,039
i think we all

707
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,880
kind of struggle with with reaching out

708
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,400
and saying hey you know i'm struggling

709
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,360
with this

710
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,480
i think i i'd say that's

711
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,159
a male thing because yeah we just don't

712
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,720
want to openly admit it

713
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,679
uh question how do you distinguish

714
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,760
between burnout and anxiety or is that a

715
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,720
professional counselling question

716
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,320
i think that's an excellent professional

717
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
counseling question

718
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,120
the mayo clinic made a really good note

719
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,480
about burnout to

720
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,760
specify that the root causes of burnout

721
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,880
aren't all known and because of that

722
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,559
you might be suffering from clinical

723
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,799
anxiety or clinical depression

724
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,480
that really balloons into job burnout

725
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,640
so absolutely i think it's a question

726
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,120
for a health professional to

727
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,520
figure out if one of your root causes of

728
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,559
burnout

729
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,799
is you know clinical anxiety or clinical

730
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,279
depression

731
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,600
all right well that's the end of the

732
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,679
questions so

733
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,520
i'll double check that yep that's the

734
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,200
