1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,839
there you go

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,839
welcome everyone my name is shane staley

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,760
and i'm an opportunity strategic lead

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,599
with the national homeland security

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,639
training office here at iowa national

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,719
laboratory in iowa falls coming to you

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,560
in sunny idaho falls this morning

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,720
hope your sessions are going well today

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,080
we're going to be talking about the

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,279
organizational security

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,560
cyber security company health and

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,920
maturity progression model i know that's

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,880
a mouthful

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,000
but hopefully by the time we're done

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,599
today you'll know a little bit more than

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,279
you did before

17
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,480
this model is called cyber champ

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,760
why is why now by cyber champ

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,760
clear educational training and learning

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,800
pathways

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,200
uh do not exist to form a structured

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,719
cyber workforce

23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,200
to realize organizational security goals

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,879
and the threat landscape is ever

25
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,719
changing and so having an ever competent

26
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,000
cyber auditing workforce is difficult

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,960
cyberchamp actually helps us take the

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,359
vulnerabilities of our organization

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,600
and help to solve those and become more

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,640
competent

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,000
by tying it directly to the competency

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,280
health of individual roles within the

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,479
organization

34
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,320
and the cyber champ model provides an

35
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,840
organization the ability to build these

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,119
customized

37
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,799
and clear educational training learning

38
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,799
pathways which help us achieve our

39
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,560
organizational security goals

40
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,400
in this ever changing threat landscape

41
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,040
this is the model it's a customized

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,720
self-help solution

43
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,119
for industry academia and private sector

44
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,520
and basically what we do is we actually

45
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,360
go and train a team of individuals

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,720
within that organization to be able to

47
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,920
form this model

48
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,320
within that company for business um the

49
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,000
idea here is to be able to understand

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,280
the cybersecurity education gaps and

51
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,240
then target

52
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,479
operation readiness improvements around

53
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,759
the competencies

54
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,200
of the individuals within the

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,759
organization

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,079
um a lot of organizations sometimes

57
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,600
aren't sure where to start or how to

58
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,880
improve security

59
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,640
uh they might lack an organized security

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,320
workforce structure

61
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,920
sometimes it's very difficult to

62
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,119
understand security competency gaps

63
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,318
and oftentimes if you're in a cyber role

64
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,679
or security role

65
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,040
it's hard to justify training and so

66
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,160
it's really important to be able to

67
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,680
develop your individuals

68
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,920
in security and when you have that

69
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,680
conversation with management

70
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,959
sometimes it's already thought that my

71
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,720
security is an overhead unit anyway why

72
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,400
would i spend more money there

73
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,280
so the cyber champ model can be applied

74
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,440
to all roles in organization

75
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,200
to help us actually build that

76
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
competency and provide direct roi to the

77
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,518
business

78
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,080
from a value proposition standpoint we

79
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,280
actually help establish

80
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,680
organizational baselines where

81
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,959
individuals

82
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,000
become competent and stay competent and

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,560
then

84
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,319
the way that the model works is we

85
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,000
actually build a roadmap

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,200
for improving that security posture we

87
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,720
help the company through the

88
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,480
self-discovery process

89
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,200
of how to establish an organized

90
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,080
organization-wide cyber duty workforce

91
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,360
profile

92
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,720
and then in the end

93
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,959
security applicants are not qualified

94
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,680
local levels training providers industry

95
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,040
and government government

96
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,879
and the pipeline fulfillment really

97
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,400
needs to come from the current workforce

98
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,000
within an organization

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,720
that future workforce students veterans

100
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,239
career changers and so on

101
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,000
this is actually a picture of the model

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,519
once again i think i showed it earlier

103
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,400
but here is an actually

104
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,319
the question we want to talk about or

105
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,799
really consider what's new and novel

106
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,200
about this model and compared to other

107
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,159
models

108
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,239
and quite frankly i'll tell you not a

109
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,439
lot

110
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,799
however what is unique is that the

111
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,439
concepts that the model deploys are

112
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,200
generally not found under one roof to be

113
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,239
able to get to this

114
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,560
competency area so on the left you

115
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,480
actually have specific

116
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,120
measurements for the security state of

117
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,640
organization so you have security and

118
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,159
cyber security measurements

119
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,840
and then you create a workforce profile

120
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,360
so you have workforce development on

121
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,560
this right-hand side

122
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,160
then you go into specific copies of

123
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,720
individuals and then we combine that

124
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,199
with

125
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,919
instructional design techniques and and

126
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:24,800
training

127
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,240
uh such as blooms taxonomy and

128
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,800
progressive learning and those type of

129
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,600
items all in one model so that basically

130
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,520
you can help your organization

131
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,199
really understand where you are and

132
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,080
build to get better

133
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,000
this next slide really focuses on the

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,960
fact

135
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,000
that workforce competency health in this

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,960
lower

137
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,199
right hand corner that really goes to

138
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,520
the underside of the stair

139
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,320
steps here is directly linked to the

140
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,680
organizational security operational

141
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,639
readiness

142
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,400
which is the top set of those stair

143
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,759
steps and

144
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,520
as you go up these stair steps we

145
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,280
realize that each

146
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,720
level of competency health directly

147
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,080
impacts security operational readiness

148
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,280
now in most cases we would really hope

149
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,600
that

150
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,680
if we were doing this we would actually

151
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,039
improve right

152
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,360
however much like an individual if you

153
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,720
don't pay attention to your health

154
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,960
and actually do some things about it you

155
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,080
can decline

156
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,720
in health and that actually will impact

157
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,280
in

158
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
you know impact in this case security

159
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,120
operation readiness of the organization

160
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,039
and so it's important to invest in

161
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,960
competency the organization

162
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,720
so that the workforce council health can

163
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,600
actually always

164
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,120
directly positively impact your security

165
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,759
operation readiness

166
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,320
the model itself has it's a process

167
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,199
cycle

168
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,960
as anything else in security it's

169
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,840
continuous in nature

170
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,199
but it has five phases and phase one we

171
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,400
analyze initially

172
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,160
uh that organizational security maturity

173
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,000
status and then we

174
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,400
help the organization understand to

175
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,160
design a workforce structure

176
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,280
around a cyber ready workforce then we

177
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,400
actually

178
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,960
talk in terms of accomplishing profile

179
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,400
and we talk in terms of

180
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,319
where they're at within their roles and

181
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,080
within competencies

182
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,240
and we use the nist nice framework in

183
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,520
this nice cybersecurity workforce

184
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,120
framework

185
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,720
and um a another framework that i know

186
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,000
has created which is an industrial

187
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,520
cybersecurity framework so

188
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,240
this model really spans the entire gamut

189
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,280
of security

190
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,520
itot cyber physical it isn't just

191
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,400
limited

192
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,160
um to any one area within security

193
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,759
um and that's what's really important

194
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,680
about this competency profile

195
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,840
and then from that net from phase three

196
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,600
we actually go into phase four

197
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,080
where we work with this organization

198
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
utilizing a task survey analysis which

199
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,599
i'll show you here in a minute

200
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,000
where we develop and implement or the

201
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,599
actual organization develops

202
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,880
and implements learning paths and

203
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,199
training plans and think of a learning

204
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,199
path as that career perspective

205
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,639
so we're going to give you a big old

206
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,479
blob of training courses

207
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,560
but then you can sit knee to knee with

208
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,680
an individual

209
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,840
and pick out from that learning path

210
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,919
kind of a career perspective

211
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,440
what that one to two year tactical

212
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,960
training plan looks like

213
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,880
to be able to properly help your

214
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
individual become and remain competent

215
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,360
and also get the maximum roi return on

216
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,160
investment

217
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,960
for the organization and then once you

218
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,680
actually

219
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,360
develop these training plans it's up to

220
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,880
the organization to

221
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,960
commit and actually take the training

222
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,840
and or do the ojt that's prescribed

223
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,520
and at some interval of time you want to

224
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,919
come back around and evaluate

225
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,039
that success so we would be able to do

226
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,639
phase five maybe after a year maybe

227
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,240
after a year and a half whatever

228
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,639
the company thinks is it makes sense to

229
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,160
be able to see if now

230
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,680
after we've improved the competency

231
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,599
health of our organization

232
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,759
has there been some appreciable uh

233
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,720
security gain

234
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
specifically in this realm a cyber

235
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,080
security

236
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,080
gain in what we're doing

237
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,240
if anyone has ever actually created a

238
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
course using the adi

239
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,720
model i like to show this slide because

240
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,319
sometimes people get really caught up in

241
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,879
the colors and the lines and the rows

242
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,520
and and all the moving pieces but really

243
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,960
all we're doing is like the way you

244
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,400
would create a course

245
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,520
so the addi process is just basically

246
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,000
uh you know those five letters we

247
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,720
analyze

248
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,440
current state we designed that from that

249
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,199
current state we develop

250
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,839
uh you know lesson plans and learning we

251
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,440
implement that course

252
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,559
and then we come back around and

253
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,479
evaluate the effectiveness of that

254
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,200
course

255
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,039
that's really all we're doing for the

256
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,360
workforce development in an organization

257
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,680
surrounding organizational security

258
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,279
we're just taking

259
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,200
uh that model that you do for a single

260
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,880
course and really just helping an

261
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,600
organization

262
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,440
realize that within workforce

263
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,959
development from

264
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,040
analyze to evaluation

265
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,279
so when we talk about cyber security

266
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,640
operation readiness

267
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,880
um it's important to understand this is

268
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,360
a workforce development model

269
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,519
and so i'm not trying to we're not

270
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,120
trying with the model to upstage or

271
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,040
supplant any other current measurement

272
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,000
processes

273
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,760
there's plenty of them out there this is

274
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
also not what you would consider bits

275
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,200
and bytes assessment

276
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,560
what we are doing is we're actually

277
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,320
helping an organization understand

278
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
where they sit in some very important

279
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,360
realms

280
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,440
uh and you can see them across the top

281
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,640
there we'll talk about them a little bit

282
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,360
later but

283
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,480
where are they at in their security

284
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,040
program maturity um what type of policy

285
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,880
control rigor and process control rigor

286
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,080
do they observe

287
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,760
what practices are observed in the

288
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,000
organization uh from a security and

289
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,279
cybersecurity perspective

290
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,360
and then what policy and artifacts are

291
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,279
actually in place and so we give them

292
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,880
as you can see here this kind of current

293
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,800
progress look with the

294
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,959
green area and then specific areas of

295
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:51,839
improvement

296
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,080
that we can then attach directly to the

297
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,279
company and you'll see

298
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,440
competency needs of the organization and

299
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,040
we'll show you that a little bit later

300
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,279
but let's ask two quick questions here

301
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,959
on this part of the model

302
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,240
so what's the current state of the

303
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,680
organization towards operational

304
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,720
readiness

305
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,560
um if something happened are you ready

306
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,640
right that that cyber security

307
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,680
notion that um we don't know when it's

308
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,880
going to happen but it's not

309
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,000
a fact that uh and if it's probably when

310
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and then what areas of them what areas

311
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
of improvement are identified

312
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,279
based on that current state and we talk

313
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,399
about cyber security here in the

314
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,120
question

315
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,440
but really uh more and more security is

316
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,320
is

317
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,600
is coming towards um you know cyber

318
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,160
physical

319
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,920
itot the convergence for all of these

320
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,680
and so the model helps in all realms

321
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,519
there

322
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,200
on the second side of the model on the

323
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,640
right side of the model

324
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,160
we talk in terms of building that

325
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
workforce structure and we'll show you

326
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,920
how we do that but basically let's ask a

327
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,839
couple of questions on this side

328
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,440
and that is based on the areas of

329
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,120
improvement identified

330
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
how do organizational cyber security

331
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,600
companies competencies align

332
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,279
and then based on those competency gaps

333
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,720
what learning and training is needed

334
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,480
across the organization

335
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,720
to establish build and then continue to

336
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,560
improve upon the security program in

337
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,680
place

338
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,120
and so those are the questions that the

339
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,519
model really helps to to

340
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,320
solve for an organization that that and

341
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,640
and these tie directly into the pipeline

342
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,320
we talked about those gaps and we

343
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,079
identify that you know

344
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,800
we can't go out and hire 30 contractors

345
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,320
so i need to really develop my current

346
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,360
workforce

347
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,279
but if i understand my workforce

348
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,720
structure i can also implement

349
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,399
contractors where needed

350
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,079
or understand where to insert

351
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,680
apprenticeships and

352
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,279
those types of things so there's two

353
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,120
sides of this model

354
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,079
and we talked about them as sections

355
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:42,560
there

356
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,640
they span together they're connected

357
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,279
together by the rows called levels

358
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,240
so section one on the left is this

359
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,760
measurement area of operational

360
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,040
readiness

361
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,880
and on the right we have competency

362
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,160
health level

363
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,440
now if i actually compare these and i

364
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,360
say in my first level

365
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,360
if i was unprepared in operational

366
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
readiness that probably means i'm at a

367
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,200
very fundamental level

368
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,480
of actually understanding uh are

369
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,320
actually in competency health

370
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,200
and so as i go if as i increase in

371
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,639
competency health level

372
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,120
i should see hopefully an appreciable

373
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,839
gain

374
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,160
in my operation by linking it directly

375
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,079
to uh

376
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,480
improving the individuals in my

377
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,360
organization

378
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,320
which is sometimes lost uh i think

379
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,040
within

380
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,480
this uh fight i'll call it with

381
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,320
cyber security and security um as far as

382
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,839
the measurement analysis

383
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,399
um like i said as far as new and novel

384
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,440
we use the cyber

385
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,959
uh not a whole lot there right we use

386
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,880
the cybersecurity framework maturity

387
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,279
uh that came out in 2018 there's also a

388
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,720
maturity tool that goes with that for

389
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,760
the process and

390
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,120
policy rigor we use the uh

391
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,320
nist the cyber security

392
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,079
the the niceness cybersecurity workforce

393
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,079
framework and i'll tell you how we use

394
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,720
those

395
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,800
we use the tasks from there and we use

396
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,079
the cmmc model

397
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,920
for the practices in this current

398
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,440
mapping

399
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,600
right now as we speak we're actually

400
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,040
mapping

401
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,600
four other primary main models and so

402
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,040
it's important to understand that that

403
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,440
the

404
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,839
cyber champ model doesn't rise and fall

405
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:20,639
on just

406
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,920
the practices in cmmc

407
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,240
there are many uh practices that you can

408
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,839
map this to

409
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,839
we've started c2m2 you can do nist 853

410
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,160
newark sip um 6243 whatever standard

411
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,000
you feel like you want to map the

412
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,760
practices to to be able to measure this

413
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,600
for your organization

414
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,279
the model can implement that

415
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,160
um so let's go specifically through some

416
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,440
just a quick rundown

417
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,199
of of what we're actually doing we

418
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,000
measure this operational readiness area

419
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,279
so first of all we're going to take a

420
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,440
look at the the nest cybersecurity

421
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,800
framework for improving critical

422
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,639
infrastructure document and it has seven

423
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,399
steps in there and we're just going to

424
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,279
talk about

425
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,839
and in general terms we ask questions we

426
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,440
have a master template survey that we

427
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,800
use it's kind of a really

428
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,320
big spreadsheet with scoring in the

429
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,079
background and we just go through and

430
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,360
ask questions

431
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,000
and we go through each level of this

432
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,519
measurement in the same way and so first

433
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,639
we're going to measure this program

434
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,920
level

435
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,040
and then we'll take a look at your

436
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,160
policy in your policy rigor

437
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,680
uh what kind of change control is in

438
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,120
place how often do you actually

439
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,320
implement the policy

440
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,160
is it currently up to date and then we

441
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,480
take a look at the process control

442
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,040
um you know the change configuration

443
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,680
management

444
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,079
and specifically uh when we talk about

445
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,120
processes

446
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,399
it's really how you're implementing the

447
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,720
practice practices and so we

448
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,320
take a look at the practices in this

449
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,839
case the 171 practices for cmmc

450
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,320
and we we try and establish from basic

451
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,920
cyber hygiene to advanced

452
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,399
or progressive um how is the company

453
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,720
doing how is the organization doing in

454
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,639
and actually establishing these

455
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,000
practices

456
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,959
and then finally we take a look at uh 24

457
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,160
policies

458
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,880
um that really uh span maturity level

459
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,959
one through maturity level five

460
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,720
and we've mapped that to the practices

461
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,279
and we say okay as an organization

462
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,959
do you have an access control policy do

463
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,720
you have remote access control policy

464
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,519
and we talk in terms of where those sit

465
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,199
um so there's a lot of

466
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,639
opportunity here to understand where

467
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,720
they are and then in the end

468
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,800
we can really get this state at the

469
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,000
bottom that's called security maturity

470
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,160
so how does that look kind of as a as a

471
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,279
as a pass

472
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,639
we're really just saying okay you know

473
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,959
in measure one we were this far and so

474
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,959
we're kind of accomplished at that level

475
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,079
and then we can see the area of

476
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,600
improvement so that's that's why we're

477
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,800
doing this right we're trying to

478
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,600
understand

479
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,800
where do we need to improve and how can

480
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
we get better and once again it's very

481
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,079
important to understand here

482
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,560
this is not regulatory or compliance in

483
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,720
nature this is a self-help tool

484
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,120
for the organization uh to be able to

485
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,160
understand how to get better

486
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,320
and improve so we're going to go down

487
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,079
through each one of these areas

488
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,639
and measure each one and then we get

489
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,600
kind of with the

490
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,279
this is all qualitative data but we can

491
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,880
provide a quantitative score

492
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,639
and so each block in the model gets a

493
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,959
four percent if accomplished

494
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,800
and really kind of a zero percent if

495
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,639
there's areas for improvement

496
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,959
and we can add that up across the rows

497
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,079
that we're measuring

498
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,800
and get it get a a cumulative total in

499
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,000
this case of 52 percent

500
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,399
which is in that reactive range so based

501
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,680
on the information we've measured we can

502
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,839
say this organization is reactive

503
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,639
uh from a operational readiness

504
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,639
standpoint

505
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,199
now then we go into section two and

506
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,079
let's talk about

507
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,839
well now that we know that what do we

508
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,040
need to do to improve or get better

509
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,440
well let's see who's first of all

510
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,360
responsible for getting better

511
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,880
so what does the workforce look like and

512
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,800
who's supposed to be doing something

513
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,959
and then what's the company level the

514
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,800
individuals that are assigned

515
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,839
and can they do it and are they capable

516
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,360
and if not how can we help them be more

517
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,399
capable

518
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,320
and then what training and learning

519
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,519
paths are needed

520
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,280
if they need help now and in the future

521
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,799
so let's take a look at that

522
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,959
specifically and we're going to start

523
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,079
with

524
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,119
utilizing some diagrams that i've drawn

525
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,000
from

526
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,439
an old model that i pulled out of the

527
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,760
shelf uh the sans ics gcsp

528
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,160
job role comp c level recommendation

529
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,439
diagram

530
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,480
and uh although this isn't like theirs

531
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,000
i did use the information from theirs to

532
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,520
build this and they have

533
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,320
four functions and i call these actually

534
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,080
cyber council functions

535
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,480
i actually added a fifth function and

536
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
implement so the four original ones were

537
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,960
awareness support maintain a design

538
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,200
and i added a fifth one called implement

539
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,799
now the key here is that they're mapped

540
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,559
to job role groupings

541
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,400
and this is how we start to structure an

542
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,720
organization on who's responsible

543
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,000
for these cyber council functions um so

544
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,480
from

545
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,679
and how we get there so basically when

546
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,559
i take this mapping i can say that

547
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,200
pretty much

548
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,120
any job role in my organization needs

549
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,240
awareness

550
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,160
but as i go up on the right you can see

551
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,039
that the job role groupings become less

552
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,960
which you would think makes total sense

553
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,799
because now the

554
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,240
abilities and these uh actually become

555
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,360
more complex

556
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,520
and harder to achieve so that's the

557
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,039
first step is to create the cyber

558
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,320
company functions

559
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,840
and the job role groupings then we take

560
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,200
the organizational look at this

561
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,760
and the top row is job role groupings

562
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,000
and then the columns are the job roles

563
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,240
associated with each job role grouping

564
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,640
and we've just finished modeling this

565
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,320
with

566
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,919
a statewide energy provider

567
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,000
and it was very interesting because when

568
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,480
we got done they had all of their

569
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,280
roles in the organization that had

570
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,880
really any security or cybersecurity

571
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,320
aspect to it

572
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,799
and we were able to map them to this so

573
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,400
so that we could be able to understand

574
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,600
their job structure

575
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,240
well that's great uh and all but why do

576
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,880
we do it well let's go to the next step

577
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,720
and we now take the operational

578
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,400
readiness the cyber security operation

579
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:06,880
radium

580
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,600
risk maturity level and from the left

581
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,039
side of the model

582
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,720
and then we've mapped that to the five

583
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,880
cyber security company functions

584
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,720
and then we have a conversation or or

585
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
the organization has self-discovery

586
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,280
to say okay based on our job role

587
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,480
groupings

588
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,400
what security company function level do

589
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,520
they need

590
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,880
which is directly related to that

591
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,039
maturity level and operational readiness

592
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,840
and so these x's represent the level of

593
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,120
training needed

594
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,960
by anyone in those job role groupings

595
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,400
and so you can see here

596
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,000
that engineering communications all the

597
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,480
way through from awareness to design

598
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,559
and on and on all the way through here

599
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,880
this is a very important aspect because

600
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,799
the next step we're going to do is

601
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,160
actually take a look at

602
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,720
the areas of improvement and then who's

603
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,080
responsible for those areas of

604
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,400
improvement within the organization

605
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,480
so before we showed you one level and

606
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,679
now we actually have this

607
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,679
this whole matrix now where we've

608
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,960
measured

609
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,360
uh each area and we've come up with

610
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,799
improvement areas

611
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,080
where the organization may lack some

612
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
competencies

613
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,159
now the next thing we're going to do is

614
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,679
let's because we've

615
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,400
now overlaid who's responsible for the

616
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,919
competency

617
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,200
and how that links to operation

618
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,480
readiness i can now specifically

619
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,720
show or actually we've specifically

620
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,679
identified

621
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,080
which job row groupings are responsible

622
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,799
for those issues so if you look at the

623
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,320
the intersection

624
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,600
of maintain and policy i have

625
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,720
operations technology i t cyber security

626
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,520
engineering i t staff job role groups

627
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,360
responsible so somebody

628
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,640
in those job role groupings if we have

629
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,039
deficiencies here and notice since the

630
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,720
green check mark is to the left of my

631
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,440
circle

632
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,880
we know that this is in an area of

633
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,600
improvement and so in this specific

634
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,480
picture

635
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,720
any block that has names in there i've

636
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,400
actually overlaid the job role

637
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,960
i actually then can go and say okay

638
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,679
instead of

639
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,400
measuring across in rows let's take a

640
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,919
look at the competencies by

641
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,039
function and the column and so

642
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,080
i do the same type of measurement and i

643
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,039
come up with a compsc health level and

644
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,400
in this case

645
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,720
as you would expect as i mentioned

646
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,600
earlier

647
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,520
the security operational readiness of

648
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,120
the organization is directly linked to

649
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,880
the county health level

650
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,840
and in this case they're reactive in

651
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,360
operation readiness and then they are

652
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,320
intermediate

653
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,520
and their company health level with

654
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,120
specific areas of improvement identified

655
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,320
now that we've actually got the

656
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,159
organizational understanding at a high

657
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,200
level

658
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,320
let's now start to focus on individuals

659
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,840
and the way we do that is we actually

660
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,640
created a task analysis survey

661
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,760
and this task analysis survey consists

662
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,480
of

663
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,960
the one thousand five tasks from the

664
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,480
niceness cybersecurity workforce

665
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,039
framework and 45 tasks

666
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,880
from an inl model which is industrial

667
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,320
cybersecurity based

668
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,520
with 45 tasks in five roles

669
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,679
so what we do is we actually neck down

670
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,799
and i'm actually going to show you the

671
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,039
task analysis survey here in a minute

672
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,000
we actually necked down from the seven

673
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,039
categories of

674
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,559
of the niceness cybersecurity workforce

675
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,679
framework and

676
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,360
an industrial sub security category

677
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,600
added by inl's expertise

678
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,720
and research and actually quite frankly

679
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,080
if you're familiar with the gentleman by

680
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,760
the name of sean mcbride

681
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,039
who's done a lot of research in this

682
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,280
area i'm a joint appointment at iowa

683
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,960
state university and then

684
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,440
we've worked really hard on really

685
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,280
making this where an organization

686
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,480
organization can use this for their

687
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,400
benefit so we've mapped the industrial

688
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,080
cyber security site in here

689
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,600
which generally when you talk about the

690
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,440
niceness cybersecurity workforce

691
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,000
framework

692
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,559
it's an it model not really known for

693
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,320
industrial cybersecurity

694
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,600
however what we do is we go from the

695
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,320
categories the specialties

696
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,400
to the roles and that next down this

697
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,320
task list where an individual can take

698
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,640
a survey on what they actually perform

699
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,440
in their job every day

700
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,520
and so you might ask the question well

701
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,679
yeah but the niceness the

702
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,120
subsequent workforce framework has tasks

703
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,760
and knowledge and skills and of course

704
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,640
if you're familiar with the newest

705
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,120
version

706
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,640
they've left off abilities but the old

707
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,240
one has abilities

708
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,480
well that's true but it's really hard

709
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
for me to ascertain

710
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,200
knowledge skill and ability but i can

711
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,880
talk in direct terms

712
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,559
when i really ask you what you do every

713
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,720
day and so that's really why we chose

714
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,360
tasks

715
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,880
as this foundation for them so i go

716
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,360
through this

717
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,480
i do the task analysis survey and the

718
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,679
key here is

719
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,039
if i go to a business anywhere

720
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,240
in the industry academia government

721
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,720
uh you know and i ask what is the name

722
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,520
of your role

723
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,120
let's say cyber analyst is the name of

724
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,760
my role or the name of my job position

725
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,000
that's not gonna necessarily match to

726
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,880
the

727
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,799
uh niceness cybersecurity workforce

728
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,000
framework roles

729
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,360
nor is it going to match to maybe

730
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,559
something that i can actually attribute

731
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,600
to training

732
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,799
so the first thing we're going to do is

733
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,720
we're going to take whatever role they

734
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,240
have whatever job they have

735
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,039
and map it to a role or roles within the

736
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,720
niceness framework

737
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
and this allows us to target

738
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,960
specifically training because a lot of

739
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,000
organizations

740
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,919
have already mapped training the

741
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,440
niceness framework

742
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,200
so if i take a look at this pie chart on

743
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,720
the left

744
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,360
and i have in this case have selected 24

745
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,799
tasks

746
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,360
um i can actually say from that tasking

747
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,640
that about 60 of of what this individual

748
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:42,960
does

749
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,200
every day is really in two roles

750
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,440
a program manager role and a database

751
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,679
administrator role

752
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,679
noting that most of us don't really have

753
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,440
always a succinct role

754
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,960
and if you want to talk in terms of

755
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,240
creating a training plan that makes

756
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,440
sense

757
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,960
for helping the individual become more

758
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,360
competent but more importantly

759
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,919
in the case of business provides direct

760
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:06,400
impact

761
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,360
to the roi let's make sure that the

762
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,159
training

763
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,120
is pointing at roles that directly

764
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,480
impact the business because i'm saying

765
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,480
this is what i do every day

766
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,000
so there's two aspects there are ways to

767
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,760
look at this the left pie

768
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,880
chart is tasking overall

769
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,120
the right pie chart is actually tasks

770
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,720
within that area

771
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,760
so as you can see there were 24

772
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,960
for tasks that i selected 30 of those

773
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,720
were in database administrator and in

774
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,080
program manager

775
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,760
and 14 of the 24 as you can see in that

776
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,880
little purple area

777
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,640
were tasks within database

778
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,159
administration

779
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,120
and if i look down below i can actually

780
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,279
see in this program management area

781
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,960
that of the 24 that i chose that

782
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,559
a smaller portion was in that kind of

783
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,039
orangish area that's program manager

784
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,360
now this is important because i can

785
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,279
actually now target the specific

786
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,559
training

787
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,640
so we've got the roles we understand how

788
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,760
to target that

789
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,919
now let's talk about competency now

790
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,760
before i mention

791
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,000
in the background we've taken every task

792
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,919
and mapped it to the blooms

793
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,600
and if i didn't mention that i i just

794
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,960
mentioned it sorry

795
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,159
so all those tasks the 1050 tasks are

796
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,840
mapped to bloom's wheel

797
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,200
and if you're not familiar with bloom's

798
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,120
will basically this is a taxonomy of

799
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,320
progressive learning

800
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,799
uh with active words right and because

801
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:29,600
this nice

802
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
uh cybersecurity framework is kind of

803
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,960
has active words

804
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,799
if you take that and then you say

805
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,200
where's the competency match

806
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,120
so we have five cyber security company

807
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,559
functions

808
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,840
and this individual really their

809
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,600
targeted training should be at this

810
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,440
between maintain and design of those

811
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,840
five levels so i have a

812
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,480
role to focus on or roles and now i can

813
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,919
focus on a competency

814
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,600
that will also provide direct impact for

815
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,360
the individual and the business

816
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,919
so somewhere in that top tier is where

817
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,440
this training should be focused for this

818
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,480
individual

819
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,360
so you can see here that uh 56 percent

820
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,360
in design and 35 percent

821
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,679
and maintained so almost 90 percent of

822
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,440
this individual's role is in that upper

823
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,400
quadrant

824
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,480
of competency so that really helps us

825
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,559
align that now here's the

826
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,039
the fun part now that i know all this i

827
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,880
have a targeted role

828
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,360
i have competency but what training is

829
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,240
needed

830
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,360
okay let's take a look at that

831
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,159
so what we've done here at i know with

832
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,200
this model

833
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,840
is we've taken all trainings out there

834
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,200
um and we're still building this

835
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,480
database obviously

836
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,399
but imagine that someone from regional

837
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,080
or local perspective

838
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,399
uh even within the state of idaho says i

839
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,600
want to be able to get training in this

840
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,200
specific area but that's offered by

841
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,080
say bsu or issue assure you a buyer may

842
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,960
be one of the six

843
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,440
uh two-year colleges right all this is

844
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,799
sitting in this database

845
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,159
and then a person goes i need to be

846
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,480
trained at the design level

847
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,720
on this right side of this this screen

848
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,559
here we we determined already this

849
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,679
person's

850
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,399
targeted competency is designed well

851
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,760
i've got a number of courses and this

852
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,279
list is kind of cut off

853
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,200
let's say i've got 30 courses now that i

854
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
can choose from this is from isa this is

855
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,240
from sans

856
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,919
this might be from an academic

857
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,240
institution or another training provider

858
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,760
it could be for my nl right but now i

859
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,120
can specifically sit down with this

860
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,720
individual need a knee

861
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,799
and say over the next two years what

862
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,200
makes sense for your training path

863
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,600
to be able to get where you need to go

864
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,960
and so

865
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,799
once again this is a self-help model for

866
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,000
the organization to do this with

867
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,559
individuals

868
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,000
so some key aspects to this conversation

869
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,520
is

870
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,960
it's helping the individual it's helping

871
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,120
the business but you can also save off

872
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,000
this information

873
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,880
and i'm going to go through the task

874
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,960
analysis survey in a minute saved off in

875
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
a json file that you can pull back in

876
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,039
and have specific discussion

877
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,480
so in summary the model measures

878
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,919
current state we go through a competency

879
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:58,399
uh

880
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,240
you know these phases two through four

881
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,159
how do we help the organization

882
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,399
uh understand who's responsible how do

883
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,720
we target in on those competencies

884
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,320
and then at some interval we come back

885
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,480
around and we re-measure

886
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,760
that state ideally we've

887
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,840
this investment right we can now show

888
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,279
roi when we get in the conference human

889
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,679
boardroom and have this conversation

890
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,760
in our roles in security and cyber

891
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,799
security

892
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,159
we can now show appreciable gain

893
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,000
in security by the investment made in

894
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,279
competencies of our individuals

895
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,840
um and so results for for government

896
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,520
industry uh partners and

897
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,080
and uh you know specifically is we can

898
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,440
provide an organizational security level

899
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,360
metric you can talk to

900
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,919
and ideally you now have a workforce

901
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:44,960
profile

902
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,880
and think in terms of we do this across

903
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,880
20 organizations in aviation

904
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,880
or 20 organizations the energy sector we

905
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,240
can come up with industry and sector

906
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,120
profiles

907
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,960
or we could step into an organization or

908
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,200
in a business and help them already

909
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,480
with some information that's coming from

910
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,559
other organizations to make their job

911
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,440
easier

912
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,760
we provide the competency health metric

913
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
we can provide learning plans

914
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,720
that you discover by job role which

915
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,840
basically is you know

916
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,399
each individual and that competency

917
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:12,960
health

918
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,120
and how to increase the organization

919
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,520
security through those individuals

920
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,880
and then clearly there are self-help

921
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,240
continuum improvement mechanisms all

922
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,279
throughout the model and

923
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,480
they're kind of listed here but we've

924
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,720
talked a lot those about those already

925
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,080
from an academic and training partner

926
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,840
perspective what does the model provide

927
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,960
potentially

928
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,799
um let's talk in terms of academic

929
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,080
institutions

930
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,200
if you're a bsu or u of i or isu

931
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,440
um you know maybe uh you know in the

932
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,480
state of idaho we're already going to

933
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,520
meet with the workforce development

934
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,720
council here in the next coming weeks

935
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,200
and

936
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,399
and starting to build some of these

937
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,320
things how do we actually start to

938
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,120
target

939
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,760
uh you know training and provide

940
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,520
specific training to those

941
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,840
businesses and industries and then feed

942
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,720
that back

943
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,080
into our academic and training partners

944
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,720
and and part of this issue really is how

945
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,320
do we how do we develop a cyber ready

946
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,600
workforce

947
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,519
um right now if you have someone

948
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,200
graduate and this is not a hit on any

949
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,559
institution at all

950
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,000
but if someone graduates with a cyber

951
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,159
security degree they're probably still

952
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,360
two maybe one or two years from being

953
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,480
really helpful to that organization so

954
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,480
if we can actually build this competency

955
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,519
within the structure

956
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,480
of of of how we get there and we talk in

957
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,000
terms of the pipeline

958
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,360
imagine the model not just being for

959
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,120
organization but the model being for how

960
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,880
we actually build this

961
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,120
we can actually come back around and say

962
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,600
okay when someone graduates

963
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,960
uh from a two-year or from a four-year

964
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,640
they're cyber ready because we've

965
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
actually built that competency

966
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,000
into that and the industry's feeding

967
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,240
that back to academia and academia

968
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,480
is better informed and we can actually

969
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,600
you know from a training provider

970
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,159
academic

971
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,559
perspective we can build together and

972
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,480
make sure that when we train this

973
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,919
that we're building in soft skills and

974
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,600
hard skills and

975
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,200
uh you know testing which is also part

976
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,799
of the model that i haven't really gone

977
00:31:58,799 --> 00:31:59,600
into

978
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,440
but the key here is it's all about

979
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,720
competency

980
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,399
and helping the individual because if

981
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,640
the individual is competent

982
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,279
then wherever they work the organization

983
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,240
will succeed

984
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,159
and overall we're going to raise that

985
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,039
cyber security and security bar

986
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,519
so that's the model now what i'd like to

987
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,960
do is i'm going to stop sharing this

988
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,000
presentation

989
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,519
and i'd like to take a few minutes to go

990
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,360
into the task analysis survey

991
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,640
and i think that'll leave us plenty of

992
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,399
time for questions

993
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,360
so one second while i stop this and let

994
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:29,919
me share

995
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,840
out the survey here

996
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,120
so what you have on your screen is the

997
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,960
cyber champ task analysis

998
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,279
survey and what we're going to do is

999
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,640
we're actually going to

1000
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,799
um hold on i need to

1001
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,000
my next is not view i have to go next

1002
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,799
and move back over

1003
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,919
um yeah i think i moved that screen

1004
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:58,880
so what we're going to do is we're going

1005
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,960
to take a look at an individual's

1006
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,600
position

1007
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,039
so let's say that i'm a cyber analyst

1008
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,679
and maybe i type in my job description

1009
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,399
whatever that job description is

1010
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,760
now the key here is i can actually

1011
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,039
choose a sector and this sector can be

1012
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,480
you know whatever it is so let's say

1013
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,360
that my sector is

1014
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,240
i'll just say in this case that i'm in

1015
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,360
the energy sector and that i actually

1016
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,760
of the dhs critical functions maybe my

1017
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,640
main

1018
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,120
function is that i actually um

1019
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,399
distribute

1020
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,440
and let's say i transmit electricity so

1021
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,880
that's just some data capture we can do

1022
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,080
as we move forward to

1023
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,519
to help move this but that's not really

1024
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,880
the main point but some things are in

1025
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,480
the background

1026
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,799
so now i see the seven

1027
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,200
categories from the nicest subsequent

1028
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,559
workforce framework

1029
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,240
and the eighth category industrial

1030
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,000
cybersecurity which we've added

1031
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,760
uh with the inl's background and

1032
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,200
expertise says

1033
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,080
uh is that's really what we do here and

1034
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,159
one of the main things we do here

1035
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,919
so let's say from a cyber analyst

1036
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,760
perspective that i need to

1037
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,520
analyze and collect and operate

1038
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,599
and investigate and i have some

1039
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,760
industrial cyber security components and

1040
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,679
this model is still uh working through

1041
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,040
so industrial cybersecurity we're still

1042
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,399
kind of working that

1043
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,639
so then i go there um let's say maybe i

1044
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,919
also operate and maintain

1045
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,239
so i've i've selected my category now

1046
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,599
for specialty areas i actually go

1047
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,839
through here and say okay based on that

1048
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,480
my specialty areas well systems analysis

1049
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,399
definitely that's one of my areas

1050
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,040
uh let's say knowledge management and

1051
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,800
now let's talk about this analysis that

1052
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,679
i do

1053
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,199
let's just say for instance in this case

1054
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,679
that i do almost all of these

1055
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,679
and then i i speci i i specifically work

1056
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,119
in collection operations

1057
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,520
maybe cyber operations and then i have

1058
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,239
some cyber

1059
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,879
investigation uh and digital forensics

1060
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:55,280
uh

1061
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,440
work and then uh this industrial cyber

1062
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,640
security

1063
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,480
now i'm gonna go into uh specific roles

1064
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,359
so based on that information so far what

1065
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,599
role would i most align with well

1066
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,240
system security analyst threat morning

1067
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,880
analyst exploitation analyst

1068
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,280
mission assessment analysts i'll say all

1069
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,359
source collection

1070
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,800
and then uh maybe i do some cyber crime

1071
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,200
cyber defense forensics and i do some

1072
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
ics analysis

1073
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,800
uh and maybe every now and then i have

1074
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,280
to do some technician work

1075
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,320
but for now i'll take that off so

1076
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,000
what i've got here is i've got these

1077
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,920
rolls picked now what i've done is

1078
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,320
by by selecting so far all i've done is

1079
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,720
necked down to this task list

1080
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,640
so now what i'm going to do is it's

1081
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,800
going to take probably an hour or so

1082
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,160
i'm going to go through this and i'm

1083
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,079
just going to randomly pick now ideally

1084
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,440
you would be reading these and see you

1085
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,800
know what do i actually do in my daily

1086
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,000
job right

1087
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,440
so i'm taking these um

1088
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,280
specific tasks and i'm selecting them

1089
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,119
based on what i normally do

1090
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,720
as part of my role and let's say that um

1091
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,880
you know i'm actually really

1092
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,800
understanding

1093
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,119
uh you know i'm actually seeing what i

1094
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,480
do on my daily dish

1095
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,880
in my day

1096
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,000
so i'm going through this list and like

1097
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,520
i said i'm just randomly picking here

1098
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,440
and the other thing that i'm going to

1099
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,119
mention here in a second is we actually

1100
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,720
have an opportunity

1101
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,160
for you to actually really

1102
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,119
create custom tasks as well and i'll

1103
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,720
show you that in the next selection

1104
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,920
so like i said this is going to take a

1105
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,119
while for you to actually go through

1106
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,359
based on what you've chosen

1107
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,720
and this is going to be even more

1108
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,480
difficult depending on how long the

1109
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,079
individuals be in the organization

1110
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,800
and how many roles they're assigned when

1111
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,000
we did this

1112
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,599
when we validated this model here with

1113
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,760
this organization

1114
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,320
in idaho they had an engineer with nine

1115
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,680
roles

1116
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,040
and so this was a very interesting

1117
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,119
discovery for them so i hit next

1118
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,720
let's say that i need to actually talk

1119
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,520
in terms of

1120
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,400
a task that wasn't in it that's really

1121
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,000
important for me

1122
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,520
i can add that task and we can build

1123
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,359
this task database out and make it

1124
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,440
longer

1125
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,440
now i'm going to hit next and what i'm

1126
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,000
going to see here is

1127
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,040
based on all that information i chose

1128
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,960
this is a really tough one right because

1129
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,560
look at all the things this individual

1130
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,680
does

1131
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,040
and so this is another thing that's

1132
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,400
really important for an organization to

1133
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,680
understand when it comes to security and

1134
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,720
cyber security

1135
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,640
how much is your person doing and are

1136
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,800
they assigned too much

1137
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,839
and really can you ever train them in a

1138
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:36,960
millennia based on all the roles you

1139
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,720
assign them

1140
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,960
so the key here is to have a specific

1141
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,320
discussion

1142
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,359
now i chose 69 tasks

1143
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,520
and of those tasks i look at this pie

1144
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,560
chart

1145
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,359
and although it's broken out pretty good

1146
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,000
um

1147
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,920
this pie on the left is really confusing

1148
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,520
right this is where the pie on the right

1149
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,880
comes in

1150
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,079
so based on the 69 tasks i can see in

1151
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,680
this purple here

1152
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,400
that if i go down or if i chose a system

1153
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,920
security analyst

1154
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,599
that's probably a large portion what i

1155
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,040
need to focus on when i establish my

1156
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,720
training plan right

1157
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,079
and it kind of gets lost in the pie

1158
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,160
chart over here this pie chart on the

1159
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,320
left really becomes that discussion on

1160
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,240
wow does this person have too much on

1161
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,680
their plate

1162
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,760
the one on the right can become really

1163
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,359
okay let's talk in terms of where we

1164
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,040
need to narrow in on training

1165
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,240
right so where am i going to get the

1166
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,240
best bang for my buck on

1167
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,079
helping this individual become better

1168
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,079
it's in the system security analyst

1169
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,599
and then this little aqua color one

1170
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,599
right which even over here

1171
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,760
shows a little bit less right so the 69

1172
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,839
tasks 20 of them

1173
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,400
were in the x point exploitation

1174
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,400
analysis area

1175
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,320
and 10 we're in the system security

1176
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,000
analysis area so 30

1177
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,160
of the 69 tasks basically 50 of my role

1178
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,520
were in two of these

1179
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,280
in these two roles so two different

1180
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,480
really important ways to look at the

1181
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,040
information now then

1182
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,920
what competency should i focus on i now

1183
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,119
want to take a look at

1184
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,839
now that i know this information where

1185
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,200
should my target be

1186
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,160
well based on this individual sixty

1187
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,599
percent of their role

1188
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,960
is right in the middle you've got

1189
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,200
awareness support maintain implement

1190
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,000
design

1191
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,760
so this individual pretty much sixty

1192
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,440
percent ought to be targeted

1193
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,320
in that middle tier um

1194
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,040
now then what's the most important thing

1195
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,280
now that i know all this information

1196
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,800
how can i help this person become

1197
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,640
competent and remain competent

1198
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,480
well let's take a look at these training

1199
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,240
levels so i've got

1200
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,560
awareness i've got support

1201
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,839
i've got maintained i've got implement

1202
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,839
i've got design but we've already

1203
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,200
established that sixty percent of this

1204
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,000
person role

1205
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,800
is in this maintain area and for you

1206
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,720
know for brevity's sake uh not all the

1207
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,240
courses are listed here

1208
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,480
but basically sixty percent of this

1209
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,240
individual's tasking

1210
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,000
that this company has them doing every

1211
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,400
day is in this maintain area then i

1212
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,920
probably ought to choose courses from

1213
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,119
this area

1214
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,280
to specifically help them become better

1215
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,119
and provide direct

1216
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,240
roi impact to the business i can now sit

1217
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,079
down as a manager

1218
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,839
with this individual and select a

1219
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,280
training course that makes sense a

1220
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,640
tactical training plan

1221
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,760
one to two years out to say what courses

1222
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,880
do i need to take

1223
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,119
that can impact um you know this

1224
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,319
individual

1225
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,319
uh help them grow help the organization

1226
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,319
get better

1227
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,040
now then let's take a look at another

1228
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,400
aspect

1229
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,280
that's really important on this top

1230
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,240
level here

1231
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,440
um i can actually go into data and i can

1232
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,200
export this file out

1233
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,440
i'm going to do that and it exports out

1234
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,440
as a json file

1235
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,640
now after i export it out i can go

1236
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,400
into my downloads in this case

1237
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,680
i can pull it back in at any time within

1238
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,000
the year or year and a half whatever

1239
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,839
open it back up i've got all the data i

1240
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,520
saw before

1241
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,200
and now i can sit down with my boss and

1242
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,640
say you know

1243
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,680
uh shane i'm not really sure that we do

1244
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,599
operate maintain

1245
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,440
uh so in in in this particular role

1246
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,319
or maybe uh you know industrial

1247
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,200
established creatures you can have this

1248
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,960
conversation remove things

1249
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,200
and add things right then i can go here

1250
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,000
and say you know

1251
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,359
i think we need to take some things off

1252
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,839
here or maybe add some things

1253
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,160
and so this is very negotiable now then

1254
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,000
another cool thing

1255
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,800
imagine if you wanted to figure out in

1256
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,400
my company

1257
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,040
a cyber analyst ought to look like this

1258
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,079
so you can use this

1259
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,000
task analysis survey to build that

1260
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,079
golden child so to speak

1261
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,160
and you can say oh here's exact things i

1262
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,359
want to do here's exact training they

1263
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,000
need

1264
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,680
and so every single one of your cyber

1265
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,760
analysts can be compared to that

1266
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,720
task analysis person or you know the the

1267
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,800
the profile you you come up with

1268
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,480
from there so um

1269
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,000
that's about where this piece of my

1270
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
presentation ends

1271
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:17,839
and i will take questions

1272
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,800
or maybe you've been answering him in

1273
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,560
the chat and donovan's been uh answering

1274
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,560
away

1275
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,480
yeah stand by shane uh we'll we'll get

1276
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,000

quick introduction again

1280
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,720
i think that the first part of this got

1281
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,560
cut off so if you could just do that

1282
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,359
introduction

1283
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,240
thank you uh yeah sure no problem uh i'm

1284

1285
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,800
laboratory

1286
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,440
i'm the opportunity strategic lead in

1287
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,720
the national homeland security training

1288
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,520
office

1289
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,560
and we do a lot of workforce development

national nationally and internationally

1291
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,800
um obviously in the state of idaho

1292
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,839
and uh and this model um really has been

1293
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:04,319
gaining

1294
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,359
you know national international

1295
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,440
attention and uh we just finished

1296
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,079
validating the model with uh and so

1297
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:10,560
we're

1298
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,160
looking to get get out get it out in

1299
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,759
idaho and help where we can

1300
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
all right thanks for that shane um

1301
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,760
are you seeing any questions in there

1302
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,040
donovan

1303
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:41,839
if so please let us know

1304
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,680
yeah question uh so will this help a

1305
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,079
person or an organization to keep track

1306
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,720
of training and competency of the person

1307
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,760
and organization

1308
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,839
yes uh that's a great point we're

1309
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,040
actually working on that tracking

1310
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,720
mechanism as we speak we're actually

1311
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,359
working with

1312
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,800
a organization called nights

1313
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,280
as in the knights of the round table

1314
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,240
they actually have

1315
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,079
hard skills testing soft skills testing

1316
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,839
and the tracking mechanism really from k

1317
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,640
through career so that that tracking

1318
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,000
mechanism really would

1319
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,079
would not necessarily uh you know you

1320
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,000
linking into the company

1321
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,319
but ideally um this would allow you to

1322
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,279
be able to track those things

1323
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,680
well that sounds great uh how could

1324
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,760
someone find more information on the

1325
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,680
cyber nights

1326
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,399
cyberknights.us all one word

1327
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,839
all right very good looking for more

1328
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,839
questions

1329
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,480
all right we did have a question that

1330
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,160
didn't come through the normal channels

1331
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,520
but

1332
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,880
with cmmc how does the framework

1333
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,720
intertwine with cmmc

1334
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,720
and also nist procedures so basically

1335
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,640
uh cmmc has five levels of maturity

1336
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,480
and so that was kind of an easy one for

1337
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,560
one of the reasons i've chosen it

1338
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,359
also if you're following kind of any of

1339
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,560
the

1340
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,000
late and breaking government initiatives

1341
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,319
the idea is that eventually you won't be

1342
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,440
able to do

1343
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,560
business with federal government unless

1344
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,960
you're cmmc certified

1345
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,319
and so that's the other reason i chosen

1346
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,240
that model and so basically there's five

1347
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,480
maturity levels there are a number of

1348
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,760
practices associated

1349
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,599
each maturity level and so the way that

1350
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:56,800
it links to the model

1351
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,480
is we basically provide the measurement

1352
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,240
back to the organization

1353
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,720
and saying you observe these numbers of

1354
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,000
cyber practices

1355
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,599
then you're probably your cyber hygiene

1356
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,119
is at this level

1357
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,440
and that's kind of how that links and as

1358
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,480
i mentioned earlier we're actually

1359
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,440
working on

1360
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,880
on that same type of accesses database

1361
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,000
with c2m2

1362
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,640
hipaa and a couple of others so that

1363
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,319
these can be used across sectors and

1364
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,720
industries

1365
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,000
all right very good and related to that

1366
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,400
question i see um how does someone get

1367
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,160
started if they are a small business and

1368
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:32,880
want to do

1369
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,880
business with federal government into

1370
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,319
cmmc if they're at

1371
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,680
a base beginning level that's outside of

1372
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,440
my realm

1373
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,240
certainly we can certainly help you uh

1374
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,280
from the standpoint

1375
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,800
of utilizing the model

1376
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,440
we'd be happy to provide a presentation

1377
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,040
to your organization

1378
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,359
uh actually we can introduce you to cmmc

1379
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,119
and what those levels are

1380
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,280
you can see how you match up and then

1381
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,480
potentially generally if you're not

1382
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,280
familiar with the way that federal

1383
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,079
government works

1384
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,560
from a smaller business perspective

1385
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,319
there's a whole registration process

1386
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,760
that takes a while before you can get on

1387
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,680
that database right but

1388
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,000
and they're not there yet so sorry i'm

1389
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,800
not

1390
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,319
too too experienced in that realm but i

1391
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,079
do know that uh i have had some

1392
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,599
individuals and organizations that i've

1393
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:18,880
known that

1394
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,720
have uh have wanted to get on the

1395
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,040
federal government registry and it's a

1396
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,520
uh it's a laborious task but i think

1397
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,520
eventually cmmc will be a huge component

1398
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,680
of that

1399
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,640
yeah absolutely

1400
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,960
right i'm not seeing any other

1401
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,599
questions um

1402
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,960
actually there is one more

1403
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,680
so question of we also have another

1404
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,040
question on youtube

1405
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,759
yeah go ahead

1406
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,839
oh there is okay so will this be

1407
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:00,880
available anywhere

1408
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,119
such as online so someone to track their

1409
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,119
competency and to figure out what

1410
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,000
training to go

1411
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,640
get next that's a good question uh yeah

1412
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,760
great question and

1413
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,520
we're working towards that end um right

1414
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,880
now we're actually working

1415
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,760
uh the question in youtube is will this

1416
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,640
hold on hold on

1417
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,760
let me answer this one uh unless that's

1418
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,680
the same question i don't know

1419
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,800
i think it's the same one oh okay sir

1420
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,720
um so basically the idea is we're

1421
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,839
actually building an app

1422
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,359
we'd like to make this an app right but

1423
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,880
it's taken us some time and so

1424
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,720
we really feel like we need to um

1425
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,000
develop this a little bit more on our

1426
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,760
side um a little insider baseball we we

1427
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,680
actually are working some army uh sorry

1428
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,520
aviation cyber initiative health care

1429
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,040
and public health care sector and uh

1430
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:43,520
work

1431
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,760
we hope in the near future help validate

1432
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,359
the modern model get a little bit more

1433
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,880
succinct and then ideally we would like

1434
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,160
to have this you know imagine this being

1435
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,599
a handheld app where you can actually do

1436
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:52,240
that so

1437
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,599
it's gonna it's a while till we get down

1438
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,520
the road but to the questions

1439
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,440
the answering the question specifically

1440
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,359
yes we we want to make this

1441
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,400
more and more affordable a lot easier to

1442
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,599
use

1443
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,359
you know the facilitated portion with

1444
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,640
validating the model

1445
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,599
took us uh thank you very much covid you

1446
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,200
know nine months

1447
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,880
but actually this model if you actually

1448
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,880
took it um you know now that we've got

1449
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,000
the processes worked

1450
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,280
out and there's different things you

1451
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,200
could probably do this within uh two to

1452
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,559
three weeks with the right people in the

1453
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,240
room and you know doing the right steps

1454
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:22,720
and

1455
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,720
right now that would probably be a

1456
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,880
little bit of inl facilitation

1457
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,960
but eventually we'd like to make this

1458
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,240
really more of a self-help

1459
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,160
type thing with only maybe a one to two

1460
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,920
day training trainer type of thing and

1461
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,559
then you're off

1462
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,280
after the races

1463
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,040
all right very good and just checking to

1464
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,079
see if we have any other

1465
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,640
questions in the youtube live

1466
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,760
or any other

1467
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,118
channels that come in

1470
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:13,839
a little bit later here

1471
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,839
all right i don't see any others unless
