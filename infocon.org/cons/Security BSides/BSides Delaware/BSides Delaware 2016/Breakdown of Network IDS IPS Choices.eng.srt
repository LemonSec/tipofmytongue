<font color="#CCCCCC">yeahs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seems fine so good to talk today a</font>

little bit about<font color="#E5E5E5"> operation center is</font>

or two to kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> had some problems</font>

8
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:46,229
along the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fun lessons to share</font>

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:50,430
with you so a lot of choices of ids and

10
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:54,449
IPS type technologies and kind of causes

11
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,220
some issues so<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start off with</font>

12
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,470
fun details of why the sock is so

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,530
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> because even when you have</font>

14
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:06,000
security folks and you put out a tweet

15
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,549
like this people still click the link so

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,640
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about as sketchy as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I could make</font>

17
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:16,590
it including ending in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> shockwave</font>

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,940
extension I still had 47 people click

19
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:27,360
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not quite sure what to say it's</font>

20
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:29,910
a completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> made-up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing x uy y</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X 0 is</font>

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,280
something that you know pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much made</font>

22
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,080
up that the URL is completely made up

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,530
although kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of made me want to buy the</font>

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,630
domain just for fun but<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh yeah so</font>

25
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,120
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will click on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> links no matter</font>

26
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,160
what no matter how sketch you make them

27
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,400
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you're intentionally trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

28
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,160
make them sketchy still 47 people click

29
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,770
this link<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do not understand that but</font>

30
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,550
that is why the sock will always be

31
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,280
necessary until we can completely remove

32
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:01,610
the user's ability to cause an issue

33
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:06,030
realistically probably not anytime soon

34
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:10,158
so a little bit history kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of started</font>

35
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,780
here so slightly jaded on the ids side

36
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:17,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">sourcefire makes snort on the primary</font>

37
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:20,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">IDs is available so slight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jade towards</font>

38
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,590
that realm of things so do a lot of

39
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:24,620
stuff right now

40
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">I run another b-sides Charm City or</font>

41

Baltimore still trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

42
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:31,810
exactly what the charming part is but

43
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:34,340
you know that that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nor there</font>

45
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:41,000
down near bwi airport and we did a CTF

46
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:45,018
and made a funny logo how many people

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember what that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from so anyway so</font>

48
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:52,190
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fun exercises we did was</font>

49
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,920
building one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rare things to</font>

50
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,650
combine these two does anyone know what

51
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:04,220
the left is or what its best represent

52
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:06,140
ish anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> bueller yeah industrial</font>

53
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:10,579
control systems is actually a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

54
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:12,649
plcs connect together so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea was we</font>

55
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:15,670
were actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking an industrial</font>

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:18,069
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and trying to apply</font>

57
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:21,738
security to it and monitoring

58
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:23,359
surprisingly this is not very<font color="#CCCCCC"> often done</font>

59
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:27,650
by people who have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of security</font>

60
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,630
experience kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a weird situation</font>

61
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,670
when you're like wait no one does this

62
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:34,280
how does our critical infrastructure get

63
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,380
protected and there's a lot of praying

64
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,410
involved which scares the crap out of me

65
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:42,560
but that's kind of the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

66
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,970
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing quickly said the number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

67
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that have gotten interested in</font>

68
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,510
industrial control system monitoring is

69
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,359
increased dramatically but trying to put

70
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:54,470
snort on it a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> tougher little</font>

71
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:56,959
complex so now I'm actually doing a lot

72
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,430
of sock and snort training and free

73
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:03,530
stuff with an allocated because that's

74
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:05,419
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're all about so network security</font>

75
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,569
monitoring because I'm definitely

76
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:13,280
stealing Rob's awesome kids comics thank

77
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:14,268
you rob so as we're looking at stuff on

78
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,120
the network we're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify</font>

79
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:21,260
what's bad what's not and deal with it

80
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">so typically that involves do we need to</font>

81
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">send</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this over to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instant response to</font>

82
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:29,150
handle a problem or not pretty simple

83
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:31,310
yes or no but it never is it's always

84
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,840
questionable because we never have

85
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,180
enough information more the time to do

86
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,090
the full research to guarantee<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

87
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,130
totally isn't malware or this you can

88
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,080
generally figure out if it definitely is

89
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:45,580
malware because you know the bad things

90
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,289
that happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> callbacks but not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always so</font>

91
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,930
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most important component of</font>

92
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:56,479
the sock is its ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this and</font>

93
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:58,699
we so tuning this is actually one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

94
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,400
most common problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a security</font>

95
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:03,740
operation center is you get a ton of

96
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,289
tickets more than that team can ever

97
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,110
poke the<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle in any given day</font>

98
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:12,050
throughout a given day so you're forever

99
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,150
falling behind well that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work</font>

100
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,330
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to miss stuff it's a</font>

101
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,880
guarantee by design so tuning is

102
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,659
actually a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people consider</font>

103
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,370
turning off noisy rules no that's

104
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,889
removing visibility from the environment

105
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:30,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">that while it definitely reduces the</font>

106
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:32,180
workload<font color="#E5E5E5"> you also might miss stuff so</font>

107
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:35,360
the hard part is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> making that</font>

108
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:38,090
judgment call how to adjust the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools</font>

109
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're using for monitoring to</font>

110
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:43,340
remove the noise without losing

111
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:46,159
visibility of threats ideally threats

112
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:50,179
legitimate to your environment so adjust

113
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:54,050
but if you have no linux in your

114
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:56,030
environment is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux exploit going</font>

115
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:59,349
across the wire really<font color="#E5E5E5"> of huge</font>

116
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:02,570
importance well maybe but usually not

117
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:06,349
unless you're trying for more threat

118
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,789
Intel given the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> world of the</font>

119
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:09,229
security operations center where you're

00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:11,570
struggling<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tickets you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">have time to mess around with things</font>

123
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,880
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are not vulnerable to unless</font>

you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify specific</font>

126
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:23,960
whole discussion of the government side

127
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,580
of things where they do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

128
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,739
concerned about<font color="#CCCCCC"> nation-states because</font>

129
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:34,849
the average business that gets breached

130
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:38,210
not necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> by a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nation-state so one</font>

131
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:40,430
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fun things everyone likes a model</font>

132
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:44,719
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it levels and fun things like that</font>

133
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:47,810
so sock maturity is one of the things

134
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:48,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that try to put model to so reason being</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">current</font>

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,460
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that flail scenario kind of</font>

137
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,250
sounds bad but when we have more tickets

138
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,380
coming in then the amount we can process

139
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:04,190
on any given day and we're guaranteed to

140
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:06,440
miss stuff kind bad and kinda like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

141
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,870
accepting that we're flailing but that's

<font color="#E5E5E5">the reality today a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of security</font>

143
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,949

it how<font color="#E5E5E5"> often do people stand up things</font>

some other buzz being

game you will hear you know they hear

these things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they demand we must</font>

have this thing and it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

240
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,840
push back and say here's proof that we

00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:31,580
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do XY and z before we're here</font>

stating we can't do this and we can do

243
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:37,010
that is very dangerous at times with

244
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:39,530
certain executives and explaining the

hard the difference between one analyst

00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:57,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">of puts it in a very difficult scenario</font>

00:11:52,270 --> 00:12:02,660
to have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion so come to some</font>

lately this is why I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the sock</font>

260
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">so apparently there's a lot of</font>

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,709
misinformation<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there not surprising</font>

262
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:31,010
but there's a lot of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:33,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that particular breach and OPM obviously</font>

264
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:36,439
had a good bit of information which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">little more disturbing even but there</font>

00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">are some similarities and some</font>

267
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:46,210
recommendations that they made that are

268
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:50,660
ironically pretty globally appropriate

269
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:52,100
so recommendations this is the one that

270
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,459
scared the crap out of me the most

271
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:58,570

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> OPM had from reading the</font>

273
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:05,110
recommendation report that's kind of

274
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:07,459
disturbing for that size organization

275
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:10,010
again with the possible misinformation

276
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,560
on that but that was the interpretation

277
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:15,170
from the report granted 240 you

278
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:19,160
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> pages it's a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to</font>

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:26,180
so there's a lot of its kind of buzz

<font color="#CCCCCC">where D to me but actually having proper</font>

it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a you know thing that</font>

calling out to a server you own such as

00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:34,770
from a red team or thread emulation team

327

system was ancient

331
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:47,940
and they said they<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't do</font>

encryption on it encrypting your

before we condemn them too badly<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

that different how many organizations

have proper tuning of their tool set so

341
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,800
that they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting more tickets</font>

00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:18,870
than they can handle I'm still looking

00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,569
great segmentation where you know

00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:23,279
different workstations are in separate

00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,920
groups with firewalls in between them

346
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:29,880
and detection of threats in between them

347
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,310
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to factor in all remote and</font>

a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more common on high priority not</font>

351
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:48,479
from one of the fun details that I had

heard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if the accuracy of</font>

and doubt at this point based on things

354
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:56,310
were said was one of the breaches it was

355
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,079
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> days from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where the initial entry</font>

356
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:01,859
point to when they actually exfil data

357
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:04,079
so I've heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> all kinds of numbers a day</font>

358
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,059
five days depending on the complexity

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,750
environment the attacker how lucky they

360

are how much design they find all<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of things but the reality is right now</font>

363
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:21,209
their research was something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

364
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:23,520
hundred forty days the attackers don't

365
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:25,230
need that long if we can't get the

366
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,689
amount of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> it takes to determine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

367

something is an actual issue

368

dramatically reduced we still can't win

369
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:34,110
because if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can identify things a</font>

00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:36,240
hundred days later well that we're

00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:41,389
wasted anyway they've already gotten all

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,390
the data<font color="#CCCCCC"> they need yes</font>

373
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,880
certainly it was a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a half at</font>

374
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:52,149
one point may have been hired different

375
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,820
points but the reality is it needs to be

376
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:58,600
in days not months or years so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

377
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:01,929
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it still is not near</font>

what it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be application</font>

379
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:06,580
whitelisting becoming much more common

380
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:13,149
still has its issues but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it defeats a</font>

381
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:15,669
lot of the simpler attackers most of the

382
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:18,130
things that people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually being</font>

383
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:20,170
breached by today aren't necessarily

384
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:23,730
incredibly sophisticated except for the

385
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:25,809
fact they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> good research and planned</font>

386
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:28,679
customization of tools isn't typically

387
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:31,450
happening in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of scenarios for</font>

regular commercial breaches its

commodity tools its commodity equipment

390
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:44,229
so can't really condemn these

391
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:47,470
organizations to too much OPM maybe but

392
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:50,020
some other ones we really aren't that

393
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:53,170
much different we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just really lucky</font>

396
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,890
organizations are experiencing the

397
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:02,950
reality of finding breaches and I

398
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,660
question that<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years ago how many more</font>

399
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,460
were being breached and didn't know it

400
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:10,720
and never found out that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> got owned</font>

401
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,910
because they reimaged or replaced

402
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:18,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware before they ever were able to</font>

403
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:20,530
detect it do you think if the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> level</font>

404
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:23,350
of sophistication of some of these tax G

405
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:26,170
is your organization really prepared to

406
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:28,659
deal with these attacks if there were an

407
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:31,030
someone on keyboard and they were able

408
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:33,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get let's say a common exploit kit</font>

409
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:35,379
and then use<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit to move around</font>

410
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:38,920
your network would you be able to detect

411
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:41,260
it within<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple days most</font>

412
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:46,270
organizations I've talked to lately the

413
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:49,740
answers now so again kind of a dark<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn</font>

414
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:54,010
but that's kind of the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are so</font>

00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:55,590

418
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:06,970

popular that I've run into snort

420
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:15,880
obviously now seems the most popular

421
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:17,889
open source for you too if you know how

422
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,570
to implement it that can be kind of

423
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:22,570
tough although it's gotten easier over

424
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:24,460
the years corporate support is through

that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good amount of history lot of</font>

they have a 40 gig a second box so at

00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,990
you're talking huge networks it can

433
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:51,550
handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if you have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money to</font>

434
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:55,680
support it or<font color="#CCCCCC"> resources there's a next</font>

435
00:20:51,550 --> 00:21:00,669
we have sir kata so cercado was actually

436
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:04,750
snort project forked back in 2010 by the

437
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:06,460
primary group seems to be ysf also

438
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,250
signature-based took a slightly

439
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:14,980
different approach on things I'll get

440
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:17,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later so kind of diverging</font>

441
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,180
paths a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have questioned</font>

442
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:23,340
and said they're pretty much<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

443
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:26,230
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and ninety percent they are but</font>

444
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:28,360
you know really when it comes down the

445
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:33,520
engineering of these things they're kind

446
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:36,909
of complex so when configuring snort a

447
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of people look at the roughly 30,000</font>

448
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:41,950
rules or so that are publicly available

449
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:44,620
and that's what they see as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

450
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:47,440
configuration and that's a lot of stuff

451
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:49,330
to configure completely understand and

452
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,980
there's categories and things to make

453
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:54,220
that easier but it's still kind of

454
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:57,490
painful a lot of work depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how</font>

455
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,800
much time you expect to spend it can be

456
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:02,140
a significant undertaking what most

457
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,879
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at is the actual</font>

458
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,830
configuration of store which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

459
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,870
two thousand lines of configuration that

460
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,949
directly affects how it interprets those

461
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,408
rules

462
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:15,950
this is an incredible amount of data and

463
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:19,099
the documentation does an excellent job

464
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:21,950
of explaining what a component are what

465
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:23,330
the options are in components but it's

466
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,519
kind of hard when you don't really have

467
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:27,710
diagrams of like what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on and how</font>

468
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:34,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">it works and how it affects the whole</font>

469
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:38,200
deal so kind of complex so just for

470
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:40,580

actually interpreting traffic kind of

complicated as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and trying to</font>

apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tool that actually grabs</font>

this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> knit filter kind of an</font>

493
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:54,049
interesting tool to play with pulling

00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,489
out where roles they're triggering so

495
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:57,590
that was kind of fun playing around

496
00:23:55,489 --> 00:24:01,580
troubleshooting iptables maybe tables

498
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:07,580
snort inside this is actually the

00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:10,039
components<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are going on and the</font>

issues take place if the interface is

516
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:55,490
busy she's never inspected by snort the

if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're interested or come talk to me</font>

521
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:09,620
after preprocessors this is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

522
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:13,310
bread and butter of how snort does its

523
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:15,860
initial analysis and protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> breakdown</font>

524
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:20,169
where it will actually normalize a lot

525
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:22,699
of things so that the rules can be more

526
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:26,680
have better coverage with a single rule

527
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:28,400
so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example the HTTP processor</font>

528
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:33,170
differentiates between if you have

529
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,910
apache or if you have I is it will apply

530
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:38,830
the same rule but with slightly

531
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:41,780
different analysis based on the actual

532
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:43,250
web server you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running this comes</font>

533
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,120
back to why it's important to configure

534
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:49,280
stuff because that's definable by you

535
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:51,560
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> most people don't define it kind of</font>

536
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,720
a makes it complex for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to do its job</font>

537
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:58,370
there's also preprocessor rules that

538
00:25:53,720 --> 00:26:00,470
identify protocol issues so this can

539
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:04,610
sometimes be helpful a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times this</font>

540
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:07,670
is primary source of noise because I

541
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:09,350
think there's even<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ICMP detected in</font>

542
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:11,300
other words a ping detected rule

543
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:15,340
somewhere in there so if you turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on</font>

544
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:18,379
you get a few you get a few alerts on

545
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:21,320
some environments millions a day<font color="#E5E5E5"> or an</font>

546
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:23,600
hour so then we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to where</font>

547
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:27,610
it processes rules this is probably the

548
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:30,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">most simple portion of it but not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

549
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:32,360
there's a thing called fast pattern

550
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:34,550
matcher that makes the rules more

551
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,990
efficient in how they're analyzed based

552
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:39,889
on the exact traffic

553
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:42,020
each packet or stream only<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets the</font>

554
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,520
rules that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are applicable to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it it gets</font>

555
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,590
kind of complex from there so we leave

556
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that one alone but it only applies the</font>

557
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:50,928
rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are applicable based on</font>

558
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:52,760
couple things it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a little bit</font>

559
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:54,470
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just oh it looks at traffic</font>

560
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,660
and identifies patterns not quite

561
00:26:54,470 --> 00:27:00,440
there's a little more to it that's why

562
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:04,870
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little config row IDs which</font>

another<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome tool I'm a big fan of</font>

564
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:10,699

explicit things explicit signatures bro

567
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:20,990
is more designed to analyze traffic and

568
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:23,389
give you an idea of what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

569
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:26,900

of the other projects over 20 years old

00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,690
at this point which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of funny</font>

572
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,720
considering how much network security

573
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:34,820
monitoring was happening at that point

574
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:40,040

576
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,649
ability to analyze odd traffic that was

577
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:47,780
not standard such as industrial control

578
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:49,580
systems that don't like to follow any

582
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,850
they do sometimes not so it outputs by

00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:01,550
default a whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> types</font>

584
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:07,159
of logs this is what I consider the

<font color="#E5E5E5">go-to ones there is a 60 or 70 different</font>

587
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:15,500
on what it sees some of the data can

588
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:17,660
actually be converted into flow data

589
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,570
directly so kind of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

598
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,160

within bro this is a understanding how

624
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:55,060
how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> interpret the data kind of an</font>

important bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll share out the slides</font>

626
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,990
later that actually has the link to the

00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:02,440
breakdown of all the different log types

628
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:07,060
because there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of history wise</font>

629
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:09,940
for bro said<font color="#CCCCCC"> risley started 95 about</font>

00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:15,520
took off and grew dramatically<font color="#E5E5E5"> and has</font>

632
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:18,220
become hugely beneficial especially in

633
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,470
industrial control systems where a lot

634
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,870
of standard tools don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do as</font>

635
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:25,060
much because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocols are pretty</font>

636
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:27,760
specific sometimes you're asking

637
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:30,460
questions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really you don't want to</font>

638
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,900
write a signature for if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

639
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:35,290
why does it happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> when does it happen</font>

640
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:38,140
that kind of thing so kind of becomes

641
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:39,639
important but it also is huge for just

642
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:42,340
general understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what's going on</font>

643
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,890
your network and ability to ask a

00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:56,230
it's a under<font color="#CCCCCC"> bro's terminology a script</font>

647
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:59,830
to look for that specific traffic

648
00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:01,870
behavior and identify it and then

649
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:03,490
associate it with a particular packet

650
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:05,739
which can be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful</font>

651
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:09,460
you look back if you have full packet

652
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:11,400
capture not always available but if you

653
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:15,010
have that the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look back and</font>

654
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:17,140
say oh here's the source destination and

00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:20,980
get all the information to figure out

00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,809
from happening is that a false positive

well I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really look if I can't tell</font>

don't recommend<font color="#CCCCCC"> it realistically though</font>

00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:44,860
competitors there's a few others other

686
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:48,880
than these two I have found kind of a

687
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:51,100
difference in their focuses this is

688
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,830
actually what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got some argument on in</font>

the past after<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did the first iteration</font>

692
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:09,550
things I know are bad seems reasonable

693
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:11,230
emerging threats has those and but they

694
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:14,290
focus a little more on the threat Intel

695
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:15,850
side so things they see IP addresses

696
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,879
user agents things that aren't

697

necessarily

698
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:22,820
they might be bad that threaten tell

side of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> Proofpoint emerging</font>

00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:32,240
that so slight variation and there's

703
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:35,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a bit of preference with this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">source fire as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you amazingly might guess</font>

works a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better with snort</font>

706
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:42,500
that does miss our kata and vice versa

707

especially when it comes to ip-based

710
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:52,670
rules now based on the engineering alone

<font color="#E5E5E5">I have not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done the actual timing</font>

testing of this but emerging threat

713
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:02,810
suricata actually analyzes IP address

714
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:04,490
based roles the IP address portion is

715
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:08,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">analyzed almost first within a role</font>

716
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:10,969
whereas snort says well I know how to

00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:16,250
to make a firewall role and basically if

719
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:19,310
you have an IP address based rule that's

720
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:23,960
a firewall rule not an<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> role again</font>

721
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:27,980
some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> non definite indicators it's</font>

722
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:30,710
a point of contention<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have not proven</font>

723
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:35,449
either because it's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work to do</font>

724
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:39,139
that test to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cerca de developer who</font>

digital bond has some nice stuff rice

729
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:55,210
yes FBI throws out some stuff especially

730
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:58,520
through the ice a community so specific

731
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:01,550
sector information so if there's a

732
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,600
threat against energy or financial or

733
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,040
whatever they tend to share that

734
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,950
information through these organizations

735
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:08,930
there's a few other<font color="#E5E5E5"> paid sharing groups</font>

736
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,939
or opt-in sharing groups especially

737
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:12,500
government stuff there's a whole bunch

738
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">of threat groups that share data that</font>

739
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,820
way for signatures some of them are good

740
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:19,100
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them are bad or i should say</font>

741
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,720
well written and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> well written and</font>

742
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,610
then there's the threat intelligence

743
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,520
groups that you can buy the feed to and

744
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:29,480
see what fire or what<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP addresses do</font>

745
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,349
you think are bad today so deployment is

746
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,410
always a

747
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:35,690
a complex issue with this a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

748
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:38,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">people struggle with actually like how</font>

749
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:42,470
do i set up these tools so one of the

750
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,589
more popular versions is the security

751
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:48,229
onion distribution very nice package

752
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:51,380
comes with pretty much all these tools

753
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:56,149
already set up in about six or seven

754
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:58,519
gooeys for it if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I so it's</font>

755
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,890
great for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lab environment but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

756
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:05,538
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of stuff you're not going to use</font>

757
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:06,769
so please turn it off or them I found

758
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:11,089
the more efficient way would be to

759
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:13,970
actually take the cert security onion

760
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:17,599
package and deploy that method there's a

761
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:20,839
package deployment grouping that you can

762
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:23,210
use for security onion other options

763
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:27,440
rock and<font color="#E5E5E5"> SM is kind of a neat little</font>

764
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:31,220
other tool similar idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> to distribution</font>

765
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:35,869
except there's one tool for visibility

766
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:38,209
and then they have in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> same box</font>

767
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:40,549
everything as well and they actually

768
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:42,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">added a full pack capture tool which</font>

769
00:36:40,549 --> 00:36:46,640
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> neat but takes a crap ton of</font>

770
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:48,140
resources to run Rock n sm box more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

771
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:52,339
security onion because you're doing full

772
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:57,469
pack capture auto snort is one of my

773
00:36:52,339 --> 00:37:02,210
buddies projects da he actually put

774
00:36:57,469 --> 00:37:06,319
together<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tool that is a bash script it</font>

775
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:09,049
will install and configure snort and a

776
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:11,329
GUI and even does some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the painful</font>

777
00:37:09,049 --> 00:37:13,788
things with like<font color="#E5E5E5"> selinux with some of</font>

778
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:18,410
those gooeys that don't play nicely with

779
00:37:13,789 --> 00:37:20,779
selinux very painful so if you ever

780
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:23,569
looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1500 lines of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bash</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I call that</font>

781
00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:26,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">a program</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless etle he says not</font>

782
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:27,619
anyway other fun discussions kind of a

783
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:30,410
neat way because you can apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

784
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:33,140
corporate security policy to a image

785
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:36,109
that you create and then add snort and a

786
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:39,259
configured GUI on top without having the

787
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:41,598
struggle of like trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement XYZ</font>

788
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:43,960
requirements on to an art existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> iso</font>

789
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:47,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">or package</font>

790
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:51,559
so kind of the other one the other

791
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:55,220
painful<font color="#E5E5E5"> things is training within the</font>

792
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:57,920
sock world how do you take a say high

793
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:00,379
school student with no experience make

794
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:06,529
them a stock analyst who is beneficial

795
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:09,259
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> prepared so not very solid way right</font>

796
00:38:06,529 --> 00:38:13,220
now a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is like networking</font>

797
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:16,750
background and get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> degree and maybe</font>

798
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:21,288
couple sans courses that are pretty new

799
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:24,619
I know it's kind of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive option</font>

800
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:26,240
but realistically<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor trainings as</font>

801
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:28,839
well here here's how to push the buttons

802
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:32,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">in this tool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learn how like</font>

803
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:35,269
was the question lady asked me when I

804
00:38:32,299 --> 00:38:39,259
did a variation of this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Augusta lady</font>

805
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:42,519
asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> well how do I teach someone how to</font>

806
00:38:39,259 --> 00:38:45,730
identify the bad things on a network

807
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:48,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">crap that sucks that's a hard problem</font>

808
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:52,700
what do we do today well we kind of hire

809
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:56,680
people that might have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea and throw</font>

810
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:59,210
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the river and watch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them drown</font>

811
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:01,750
kind of people pull them up when they

812
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:04,369
have time and over time<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the pain of</font>

813
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:06,680
how I screwed this up and this was

814
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:09,049
malware and I thought it wasn't or vice

815
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:12,049
versa false positives false negatives

816
00:39:09,049 --> 00:39:14,569
you start to improve realistically we

817
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:16,430
need a better method or at least a way

818
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:17,960
to simulate that you're not doing that

819
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:20,210
with like live malware on the network

820
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,670
because when you say light malware in

821
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:25,490
the network is not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem that's kind</font>

822
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:27,829
of bad or vice versa you're creating

823
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:30,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">more work for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> organization</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has a</font>

824
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:32,359
struggle with<font color="#E5E5E5"> time management and not</font>

825
00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:34,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">having enough time to do its job</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

826
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:36,890
a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really complicated problem</font>

827
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:40,609
there isn't really a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> solutions</font>

828
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:43,250
out there on the good side there's more

829
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:45,710
companies popping up that are trying to

830
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:47,900
work on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> sans is trying to work on</font>

831
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:51,619
this they made a new class specifically

832
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:55,490
to target continuous monitoring about a

833
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:57,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">year ago so still out of beta but not</font>

834
00:39:55,490 --> 00:40:00,848
quite as mature as I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

835
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:03,140
hey we're all dreamers right it's

836
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:04,970
developing a course for this is kind of

837
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard there's a lot of problems and a lot</font>

838
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:09,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">of understanding a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

839
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:12,080
need to know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take a BC and get</font>

840
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:14,119
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> together and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

841
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:16,069
complicated because you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn</font>

842
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:18,140
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools and understand how to put</font>

843
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:20,330
them together what's the prereqs for

844
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:24,140
that class<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then how do you start</font>

845
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:29,450
right like that's not easy so kind of a

846
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:33,170
hard problem so some steps forward kind

847
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:35,359
of that tuning thing of like hey what's

848
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:38,000
our biggest thing that's alerting us

849
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:40,730
right let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> large start to look at that</font>

850
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,339
and start to identify how can we not

851
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:47,060
lose visibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> and actual threats and</font>

852
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:49,580
start to filter that out so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font>

853
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:51,349
have Linux do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need the</font>

854
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:53,529
thousands of Linux rules and alerts that

855
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:56,720
we're getting every day maybe not

856
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:58,310
similar with database architectures or

857
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,939
other things you can start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn off</font>

858
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:04,910
things or filter down so that SQL

859
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:07,240
injection for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have matched</font>

860
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:11,660
the correct database type with correct

861
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:14,209
database server again details thing lots

862
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:16,910
of complex and depth time researching

863
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:19,760
your network and asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions hence</font>

864
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:22,368
why for I typically recommend a

865
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,440
signature based IDs and something like

866
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:26,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">bro to learn about your network the two</font>

867
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,910
combined actually work<font color="#CCCCCC"> really well and</font>

868
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,830
are powerful furthermore you can pump

869
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:34,580
snort<font color="#E5E5E5"> into bro to actually get like</font>

870
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:38,980
connection IDs for alerts that's really

871
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:43,670
nifty and helpful password vaults and

872
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:46,099
thats everywhere instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focusing on</font>

873
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:49,130
closing tickets and trying to close the

00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:53,240
most number<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can in a day reducing</font>

875
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:55,820
the volume of tickets if I can take

876
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,919
close a hundred tickets or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can take</font>

877
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:02,359
out a<font color="#E5E5E5"> category of tickets from happening</font>

878
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:04,580
again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will win much faster by actually</font>

879
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:07,609
removing the category and reducing noise

880
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:10,670
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future then that needs to be the</font>

881
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:11,549
way we start to adjust tuning and for

882
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,110
some organizations

883
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,900
tuning<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to start happening not just</font>

884
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:17,640
turning off<font color="#E5E5E5"> roles or not just ignoring</font>

885
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:22,490
stored alerts I actually had an

886
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:25,500
organization that was getting it was

887
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:31,140
2,000 emails a day of about 50 alerts of

888
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:33,080
pop for two<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys and we didn't get the</font>

889
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:35,310
option<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually adjust the tools</font>

890
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:38,759
filtering out the things that we didn't

891
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:41,520
care about was probably the only way we

892
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,900
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever hope to catch up zolina it</font>

893
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,910
was only<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight hundred machines so</font>

894
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,980
there's no way that number of attacks

895
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:49,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">was going on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or bad things it was all</font>

896
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:52,290
false positives pretty much mostly from

897
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:56,040
the same things there were certain top

898
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:58,170
rules if you look up there's performance

00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,860
performance components to all these

901
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:03,900
tools or you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at what's</font>

902
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:06,480
taking up most resources that's

903
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,860
generally what's the highest number of

904
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,960
alerts you can also pull that in your

905
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:12,960
sim and start to look some of the

906
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,510
statistical data and remove your<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font>

907
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,610
alerting rules not remove them but

908
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:20,580
actually solve the problem that's

909
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">causing them as well because again</font>

912
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:30,140
network is misconfigured and you tell

913
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:32,580
the network admin hey go fix your crap

914
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,839
you need to turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> off this thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

915
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:36,029

916
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,790
what it does and it's causing noise or

917
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:45,090
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to configure it correctly</font>

918
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:49,140
again complicated problems as a sock

919
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:52,050
improves have a pen test focus on

920
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:55,680
testing the sock emulate a new threat

921
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:58,230
and figure out how long<font color="#CCCCCC"> it takes to deal</font>

922
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:01,770
with that know how good or bad you are

923
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:03,540
that way you can gauge improvement it

924
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:05,910
may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be perfect but if you can</font>

925
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:07,830
simulate a threat once a month and have

926
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:11,580
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> senior guy say okay we're to</font>

927
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:15,029
customize whatever and on the nifty

928
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:19,740
things about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cobalt strike yeah Raphael</font>

929
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:22,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mudge's plug anyway he built in a way so</font>

930
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,640
that the implant that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

931
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:25,110
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> customize to look like a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">specific piece</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of malware</font>

933
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:30,660
so if i want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send out something to</font>

934
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,340
make the call back look like a

00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:36,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular piece of malware that I know</font>

936
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:39,510
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> sock has detected that is a hugely</font>

937
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:42,870
beneficial way to test how do they

938
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:44,910
respond we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> pentesting the sock</font>

939
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:46,670
today for the most part<font color="#CCCCCC"> almost no pen</font>

940
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:49,200
testers I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have ever done that</font>

941
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:52,020
they've never tested with the intention

942
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,930
of getting caught that is a reality that

943
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:56,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out how we doing if we</font>

944
00:44:54,930 --> 00:45:00,629
know we can detect something how long is

945
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:03,480
before sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remediation this is a</font>

946
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:09,840
really tough issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentesting the sock</font>

947
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:13,410
is not common but it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be so lots</font>

948
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:15,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">of information lots of stuff I'm trying</font>

949
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:17,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work on this myself with some lovely</font>

950
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:20,490
classes starting a training business

951
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:21,779
called forgotten security and when you

952
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:26,160
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I already have the handle for last</font>

953
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:28,170
few years anyway yeah i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing a</font>

954
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:32,399
beta in the next couple months locally

955
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:35,700
and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> maryland hackerspace fun times</font>

956
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:39,600
are there any questions a lot of

957
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:43,759
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> but hopefully not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too many</font>

958
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,759
confused stares yeah

959
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:56,860
so again it depends on the maturity of

960
00:45:52,690 --> 00:46:00,730
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> team right I've got known definite</font>

00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:03,580
indicators that are I can fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I can</font>

00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:06,130

963
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:07,840
guaranteed win or<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can submit a false</font>

964
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,180
positive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have them actually adjust</font>

965
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:13,930
the role<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix that or make the</font>

966
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:16,450
adjustment myself that's solvable when I

967
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:19,480
have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be bad it's</font>

968
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:21,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">really beneficial for mature sock for a</font>

969
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:24,960
sock that's struggling to deal with

970
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:28,569
known threats they're not ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it</font>

971
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,360
it's a progression and while we need to

972
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:33,330
protect organization as best we can

973
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:36,550
focusing on things that aren't

<font color="#E5E5E5">cost-effective in time is not the best</font>

975
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:43,750
use of our time again not a popular view

976
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:46,660
but the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance of stopping today's</font>

977
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:48,870
commodity attacks is to focus on the

978
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:51,520
commodity identification<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have as</font>

979
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:53,980
the tools get better so all shocked as

980
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,470
we solve the easy wins that aren't so

981
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:59,470
easy right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we can start to look</font>

982
00:46:56,470 --> 00:47:02,379
towards that<font color="#E5E5E5"> more complex threat or just</font>

983
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:04,660
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> different new variants if I</font>

00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:12,850
is the joke right now with a PT all

<font color="#E5E5E5">right well what's apt well if they can</font>

988
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:18,000
use commodity tools and win they're not
