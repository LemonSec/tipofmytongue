okie dokie<font color="#E5E5E5"> class is in session thank you</font>

2
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,860
everyone for coming and spending your

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,750
time especially the last talk of the day

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:27,060
here and hopefully we'll wander down one

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,630
of the many paths and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sharon experience</font>

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,989
together of what my mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do against</font>

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:39,809
everything around us but uh in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vein</font>

8
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:45,629
of that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a crappy opener</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:47,909
show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay ish whatever now Eddie yeah</font>

10
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,909
everything else so my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Russ</font>

11
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:53,640
hahndorf I've been around in this plane

12
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:56,339
of existence for quite some time my

contact information<font color="#E5E5E5"> is Russell at hand</font>

14
00:00:56,339 --> 00:01:01,430
or calm or org and my twitter handle is

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,540
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look behind you I volunteer</font>

00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">extensively in the wireless village so</font>

17
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,450
if you see me<font color="#CCCCCC"> around at conferences</font>

18
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,420
that's typically where you would have

19
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,860
found me where I run and design some of

20

<font color="#E5E5E5">the software defined radio challenges</font>

00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:19,229
those life experiences I try to move

them over<font color="#E5E5E5"> and two other practical</font>

28
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,810
little bit wonky for me so I've recently

29
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,428
finished defending my PhD as a so if

that little kind of attention deficit

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,320
squirrel moment where there will be

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">these random projects or random ideas</font>

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,908
that just show up out of nowhere that

37
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,499
drove<font color="#CCCCCC"> me away from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I was exactly</font>

00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:04,109
turned into one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so over the last</font>

43
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:15,060
that's done you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got about an acre</font>

that was awful I'm never done with the

47
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:27,630
wireless village just can't quit zero

48
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,730
this talk is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about one of those tangents</font>

49
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,730
which was building an atomic clock at

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,160
home as poorly and quickly as possible

51
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,890
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then there's another project which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">gauge the level of nakedness that I'm</font>

regarding Soho<font color="#CCCCCC"> SIGINT personal tangent</font>

63
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,700
thanks to drag horn I think he's uh put

64
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">around in that project with his new</font>

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,350
revamped version of kismet because it

66
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,480
now does everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> Soho Sagan was</font>

67
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:20,760
starting to do so tip of the hat to him

68
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,380
for doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but anything else that</font>

69
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,190
kept me from<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to write my</font>

70
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:28,320
dissertation was fantastic and I do have

71
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,030
a daughter she was a distraction in that

72
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,400
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well but that's that's a</font>

responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just can't leave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> her on</font>

74
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,700
her own I can just pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a soldering</font>

75
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,880
iron and go to town on something else

76
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,130
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my own self detriment towards</font>

77
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,470
finishing that well finally I'm done so

78
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,920
I have a void of time to fill future

79
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,970
projects<font color="#CCCCCC"> our experiments with geophone</font>

80
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,149
some things along those lines<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

81
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,910
whatever security haunts us by day you

82
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,100
got to have something by night that

83
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:58,620
helps you rebalance yourself well in

84
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,019
this particular project<font color="#E5E5E5"> I managed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

likes to explore these wild random

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,750
ventures every once in a while together

88
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:12,899
we've made a musical Tesla coils<font color="#CCCCCC"> nixie</font>

89
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,870
you name it clocks caller ID displays

all that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of random stuff plasma</font>

92
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,720
mission is to see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> long I could leave</font>

93
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,669
a project on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kitchen table</font>

94
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,360
unfinished to see how quickly my wife

<font color="#E5E5E5">gets pissed off but he joins me in these</font>

96
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,720
ventures and building

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,190
and atomic clock at home was one of the

98
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:44,040
ones that interested them so rubidium

99
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:47,640
oscillators 101 this slide pretty much

100
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:50,940
describes exactly at a high level the

101
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,430
mechanics of how they work so in the you

102
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:57,270
have this thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is beautifully</font>

103
00:04:53,430 --> 00:05:00,000
named the physics package and inside

104
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:03,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">that physics package you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a chamber</font>

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,800
that has one isotope of rubidium that's

106
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:09,720
been gasified and then you have a

107
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,890
rubidium lamp<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's another isotope and</font>

108
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,830
of that same isotope of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lamp is a</font>

109
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:21,210
light detector and when you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

110
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:24,270
physics package excited and the rubidium

111
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:27,120
starts generating to the tempo of a very

112
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,039
specific temperature it oscillates<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

113
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,900
it oscillates very very controlled in a

114
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,030
very very predictable predictable manner

115
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,450
whereas to the point where if you use it

116
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,190
as a time source the<font color="#CCCCCC"> error in seconds is</font>

117
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,740
measured in hundreds of thousands of

118
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,630
years it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cesium clock which</font>

119
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,390
costs a whole lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build and</font>

120
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:48,900
requires a lot more equipment and add

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,560
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> not accurate as accurate and this</font>

124
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,869
sorry is far more accurate than a

<font color="#CCCCCC">something for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my kids</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have to handle</font>

129
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:13,580
good enough for government work so the

00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:19,169
the easiest<font color="#E5E5E5"> fastest way to do this is to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">purchase this device is called a fe 568</font>

145
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,430
calibrated for a 10 megahertz sine wave

146
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:56,159
and nothing else some may have any

147
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,020
combination of those fine features of

148
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,750
being able to set the frequency<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:05,099
going to oscillate at on its way out or

150
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:06,780
be a PPS generator or anything want

151
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,270
along those lines and in addition to

152
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,000
that it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have different interfaces on</font>

153
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,340
it as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so in the leftmost image you</font>

154
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,920
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a db9 connector on</font>

156
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,900
SMA connectors off the back so depending

157
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,210
if you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out and purchase</font>

158
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,719
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these pay very very close</font>

159
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:31,049
attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what it looks like and what</font>

160
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,960
the specified description is about it

161
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:37,290
and you can buy them off of ebay without

162
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,180
any problem and what you are ideally

163
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,430
looking for off of the ones on ebay are

164
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,890
ones that give you a pulse per second

165
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:47,040
out one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> also gives you a 10</font>

166
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:49,469
megahertz signal out sine wave and then

167
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">even more ideally one that has serial</font>

168
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:55,710
input output on it that way you can do

169
00:07:52,530 --> 00:08:00,000
my new calibration<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the rubidium</font>

oscillator itself this picture on the

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,510
right that has everything outlined look

to purchase that particular oscillator

176
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:24,210
so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that physics package and</font>

177
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,270
what does this mystery device look like

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,950
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inside well once you open it up</font>

179
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,200
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some discrete electronics but</font>

180
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,789
you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's two pieces well</font>

181
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,429
there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of yellow at the top</font>

182
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:40,468
which is soft foam that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would use for insulation that</font>

187
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,620
is the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you absolutely have to</font>

188
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,170
make sure keeps warm and all that sort

189
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:55,530
of stuff but if it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> too hot it can</font>

190
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:58,079
create error in one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other sub</font>

191
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:00,030

193
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:05,220
ones if they don't have the PPS output

194
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,500
or anything along those lines when you

195
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,560
do open them up you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's</font>

connector on the motherboard sometimes

198
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,180
you can just do that yourself and save

199
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,790
yourself the headache or you could open

200
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:23,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">it up and follow the trace is very very</font>

201
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,709
they're wonderfully labeled but you can

202
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,800
follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traces to directly connect to</font>

205
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:39,360
now the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's I got a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

206
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,910
ahead of myself but i'll go ahead and

207
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,370
explain it real quick these things

208
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:47,040
actually and i'll go back to this slide

209
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,290
to explain that part where these come

210
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,459
from typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> are recycled cell phone</font>

211
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:55,740
tower transmission sites they get sent

212
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,210
over to China dismantled and then they

213
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,020
somehow show up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> eBay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then ship</font>

214
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,910
back into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US somehow that southpark</font>

215
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,260
episode of jewelry moving around the

216
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,730
world kind of comes back in my head

217
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:10,400
brigade but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time regarding</font>

218
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:12,720
electronics these are typically used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

219
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,270
provide the signal and clock sourcing

for TDMA and cdma-based hours they're

221
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:21,660
also in<font color="#CCCCCC"> GSM as well but that is what</font>

222
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:24,000
their actual commercial uses for<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

223
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">are military uses for these as well you</font>

224
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">can kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of guess what might require</font>

precision guidance controls directions

226
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:35,220
that can be disposable so you don't want

227
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,160
to lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that costs a couple</font>

it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and done sort of thing a</font>

231
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:47,040
that that's another use out of these

232
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:49,770
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> well the but what's more</font>

233
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,150
interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me is like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going it's not</font>

234
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,890
so much the electronics piece it's like

235
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,600
learning how these suckers work and

236

previous overall diagram I showed you

240
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:07,079
what is inside on the top there you have

241
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the photo detector in the middle you got</font>

242

243
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,300
all right there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> beat</font>

244
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,519
vidiyum inside of there that's nice and

245
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:20,829
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when it heats up its going to</font>

246
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:23,920
gasify and and the bottom is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lamp so</font>

247
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:34,359
that's that's what it looks like on the

inside yes they typically use cesium

249

this and GPS in a minute because ntp

252
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:52,420
made the decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me so my initial</font>

253
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:54,609
build objective was to sarcastically be

254
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,670
able to answer the question from my wife

255
00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:00,579
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what time it is or at least</font>

256
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:03,010
that's one of the most sub motivating

257
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:04,719
goals was but more importantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

258
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,829
just kind of like to have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

259
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,260
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the house and once I</font>

260
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:11,920
understood how to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it work build</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">do some very simple time experiments and</font>

263
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:18,130
demonstrations with my kid like you can

00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,240
a long weekend and then come back and

267
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,888
you show the time is different between

268
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,240
the two because the effect of gravity<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

the rubidium oscillator which is a very

measurable thing to be able to

271
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:36,010
demonstrate and then for anyone who's

272
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:38,199
ever seen the madness at my house I also

273
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,990
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this fit inside the rack</font>

274
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:44,769
and then have rest of my other

while to get through customs and the

00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason why I took a while was because of</font>

the rubidium piece of it but it

280

eventually made it through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was</font>

radio operators like to use these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

284
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,980
will like quotations to use these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

primarily because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the the use of the</font>

286
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,300
times the 10 megahertz freak sine wave

287
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:22,209
frequency that comes out of it 4

288
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,740
gigahertz communication so anything

289
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:24,510
that's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 gigahertz and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high oh</font>

290
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,310
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> one point</font>

291
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:30,140
giga hertz and<font color="#E5E5E5"> higher you really need to</font>

292
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:33,030
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good TCO tcxo in order to drive</font>

293
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:35,610
that to be the oscillator to drive that

294
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:38,610
radio these are really good cheap

295
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:40,590
solutions for that well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

296
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,620
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous slides you have two</font>

297
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:45,530
voltage inputs one is a 5 volt and the

298
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,030
other ones like a 17 to 19 volt input

299
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:51,390
well the folks who mailed this over were

300
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:53,550
kind enough to also send a free power 5

301
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:56,670
volt regulator with it that you just

302
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:59,459
solder yourself which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

303
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,949
chip that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and then they also</font>

304
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:05,820
gave like this little stuffed bear thing

305
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:08,730
anyways i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if it fell in the</font>

306
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:11,160
box by accident and the the packing

307
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,230
month or not this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how mine showed up</font>

308
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,800
and it was fantastic it had everything

309
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:20,370
that I needed it had a chopped db9

310
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,990
connector on it which<font color="#E5E5E5"> was great had nice</font>

311
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,370
foam padding on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> side which told me</font>

312
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,800
it was handled with tender loving care

313
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:28,770
when it was removed and they were kind

314
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,890
enough to throw in like a really

315
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:33,689
inexpensive 5 volt regulator and these

316
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:36,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like a few cents but it's the</font>

317
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:40,050
thought that counts well I mentioned

318
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know my friend went on this</font>

319
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,459
adventure as well and he bought one from

320
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:48,390
the exact same supplier his did not show

321
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:52,050
up as an such good condition if you can

322
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:55,650
see in the lower<font color="#CCCCCC"> right hand image it</font>

323
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:58,260
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they there's grommets and</font>

324
00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:01,439
rivets that they used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> onto a</font>

325
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:07,380
heatsink plate and they just like cut

326
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:09,870
him off angrily and he he contacted the

327
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:12,689
ebay seller and then they sent him

328
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:15,210
another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> for free nice on them we got</font>

329
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:20,580
this one working<font color="#E5E5E5"> again so we got two for</font>

330
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:22,200
one so essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just wanted to see</font>

331
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,630
what would happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you know let's just</font>

332
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">go ahead and solder it up plug it in</font>

333
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,920
turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on fingers crossed let's see if</font>

334
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,569
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> works and the the things you got to</font>

335
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,310
watch out for is that you got your two

336
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,360
different voltages so you got to apply

337
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the right ones to the right pens</font>

338
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,160
otherwise you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a sad</font>

339
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:41,670
a moment there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pen that is high</font>

340
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,579
that goes too low when the physics

341
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:47,219
package is able to receive a sense that

342
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:49,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">the 10 megahertz frequency is stable</font>

343
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:54,570
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is doing is is constantly</font>

344
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:56,160
watching itself that sine wave and if

345
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,959
it's more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 10 megahertz it's</font>

346
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,579
starting to cool itself off and if it's

347
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:03,180
less than 10 megahertz is starting to

348
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:05,880
warm itself back up so once it's exactly

349
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,410
at 10 megahertz it tries it's best to

350
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,270
keep the temperature under control and

351
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:11,250
it goes hey I'm locked onto a good

352
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:13,589
signal source life is peachy and then

353
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,649
once luck is achieved the pulse per

354
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:20,820
second pen starts firing out a pulse

355
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:22,350
once every second so I was estatic to

356
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,600
see that I didn't release the purple

357
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:27,390
smoke there were no<font color="#E5E5E5"> funny smells I got a</font>

358
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,330
fantastic perfect 10 megahertz a signal

359
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:33,180
out of it the pen the lock pin went low

360
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:36,270
and it totally worked as advertised out

361
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:39,839
of the box this was going to be easy or

362
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:45,480
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought but that was the good news</font>

363
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:48,330
and what I did notice out of it was a

364
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">few other things this sucker gets hot</font>

365
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:55,170
the temperature on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that meat thermometer</font>

366
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:57,329
says it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> below 110 degrees I took</font>

367
00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:00,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">that picture when it didn't receive lock</font>

368
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:05,189
yet so it gets a lot hotter I measured

369
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:06,899
it at 180 degrees when it got locked

370
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:12,179
when it locked onto the 10 megahertz

371
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:16,260
frequency and regarding that I was kind

372
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:18,839
of curious of can I prove even further

373
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,640
that the temperature heating cooling

374
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:23,069
mechanism is working correctly by

375
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,050
forcing it to go in and out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of loch by</font>

376
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:27,178
you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> dropping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heat sink on</font>

377
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,590
it and then secondarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that knowing</font>

378
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,179
that there's some discrete electronics

379
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,639
on the inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are really really</font>

380
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:36,390
sensitive to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of heat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

381
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,340
this oven can generate inside of it is

382
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,380
there something I can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> to control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

383
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,178
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing is mounted typically</font>

384
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,130
on a giant sheet of metal and that's its

385
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,890
way to convict<font color="#CCCCCC"> the heat off the exit</font>

386
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,730
seat so I just went<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the parts</font>

387
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">been found</font>

388
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">low profile when you heat sink with a</font>

389
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,590
fan plopped it on it within like a few

390
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:57,809
seconds it went out of lock and then I

391
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">just found it moved it to a good spot</font>

392
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:01,110
where then went back into lock but now

393
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,840
the average<font color="#E5E5E5"> temperature</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the whole</font>

394
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,459
package externally to the touch is about

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:11,040
a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> degrees I can live with this</font>

396
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:13,530
now burn my house down so the next part

00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,720
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the experiment was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright I i now</font>

398
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:19,710
have a working physics package I like

399
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:22,290
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next thought was</font>

400

<font color="#CCCCCC">alright well I've got this pen that's</font>

401
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:27,178
one pulse per second I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be</font>

402
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,660
able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know throw some bubble goo</font>

403
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:33,570
bubble gum & goo & gum and hope and

404
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:35,340
dreams directly to the GPIO pin of a

405
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,620
Raspberry Pi and start counting<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

406
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:42,120
receiving<font color="#E5E5E5"> that pulse per second and life</font>

407
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:46,830
will be great<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was definitely</font>

408
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:48,500
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case so the before you connect</font>

409
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,520
anything up you<font color="#E5E5E5"> always got to measure</font>

410
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:54,030
what you're seeing and what you're

411
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,559
receiving so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I measured what my pulse</font>

412
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:58,139
per second look like out of this thing

413
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:01,020
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the characteristics were is that the</font>

414
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,990
pulse was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> micro second in length so</font>

415
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:06,720
that's really really really really quick

416
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:09,690
it typically peaked out at about<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

417
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:14,910
volts for its pulse per second which is

418
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:16,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">fairly high and then the I took a look</font>

419
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:19,230
at the specs of what the raspberry pi

420
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:24,000
can did today can detect on his GPIO

421
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:27,600
pins and typically it wants a signal to

422
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,630
last it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like a imagine a bell</font>

423
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,428
ringing if it goes tink it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

424
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,260
hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but if it goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gong and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

425
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:35,520
rings out a whole lot longer there's a

426
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,049
higher chance or a higher probability

427
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,450
that the pie is going to pick that

428
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:41,070
signal up when its internal clock goes

429
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,470
through and goes and what's the status

430
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,178
of me who that tickles<font color="#E5E5E5"> and registered a</font>

431
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:47,820
tickle and so the pen must have received

432
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:50,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">a pulse the other last part was the</font>

433
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:54,559
raspberry pi will only take on<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data</font>

434
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:57,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">pens a max voltage of three volts so I</font>

435
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,918
was frustrated this was not going to be

436
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:00,600
as easy as like take this thing and plug

437
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:01,389
it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and life was going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

438
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,019
great so

439
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:09,779
I amended my build objective list to not

440
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:12,940
cook my raspberry pi so that was

441
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:14,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">injected directly as a new thing but I</font>

442
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:17,829
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to compare it against</font>

443
00:20:14,469 --> 00:20:19,539
so I had another GPS that did work

444
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:24,459
directly off the GPIO pins of the

445
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:28,149
Raspberry Pi it had a 3 volt max and it

446
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:30,879
also did a PPS output so I did a quick

447
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:33,369
comparison between what my rubidium

448
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:35,589
clock was generating and what a GPS

449
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:37,779
generates so the GPS is the image on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

450
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:40,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">right you'll recognize the one from the</font>

451
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:43,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">rubidium oscillator on the left and if</font>

452
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:45,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't read the values at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom</font>

453
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:48,839
each interval here is one microsecond

454
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:55,149
each interval here is a hundred

455
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:57,369
milliseconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> so significantly longer but</font>

456
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:58,958
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was exactly at three volts DC it</font>

457
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:02,769
proved my theory of like it needed to be

458
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:04,989
about 100 milliseconds in length and but

459
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:07,509
also at the same time I also looking at

460
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:09,729
it I was like well it my<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous one</font>

461
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:15,669
was a nice little as square wave as you

462
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:17,409
can get for a pulse this thing isn't so

463
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:20,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">that tells me that the Raspberry Pi</font>

464
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:23,529
isn't picky enough about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for its</font>

465
00:21:20,139 --> 00:21:26,199
signal n for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPIO pins</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so it</font>

466
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:27,429
doesn't have to be perfect fine I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

467
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,509
live with this this is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

468
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:34,419
that part at least hopefully easier so

469
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:36,279
leave it to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> blonde to turn a DC signal</font>

470
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:43,239
back into an AC signal for a pulse per

471
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:46,779
second and what what was happening was

472
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:50,559
the pulse would hit the diode and the

473
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:53,169
diode would resonate up and down up and

474
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,119
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then slowly get quieter but the</font>

475
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:58,599
good news was is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I saw that the</font>

476
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:01,539
diode was<font color="#E5E5E5"> resonates trib increasing the</font>

477
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:04,359
length of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that resonation so I was like</font>

478
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:07,658
okay I was able to draw out that that

479
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:09,428
pulse to an acceptable<font color="#E5E5E5"> window but damn</font>

480
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,870
it I now have an AC signal this isn't

481
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:15,580
cool

482
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:19,959
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was a the other thing that I</font>

483
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:23,110
noticed eventually after I fixed that

484
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:26,590
part of the problem was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Raspberry Pi</font>

485
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:28,570
was now able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> detect the PPS but it</font>

486
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:30,580
was picking it up on these time

487
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:34,480
intervals like way way way too quickly

488
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:41,949
so I'm intervals were in milliseconds of

489
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:44,980
each other so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would the DDD DDD DDD</font>

490
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:46,990
DDD over and over and over so anyone who

491
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:51,640
works with radio what do you think I was

492
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:55,120
getting mmm what happens if you have

493
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:58,590
power tripping down a line and it hits

494
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,389
the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that line remember then that</font>

495
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:03,490
you have to put a terminator yep in

496
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:08,020
order to keep reflections from coming

497
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:10,210
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it up elections up the pole</font>

498
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,610
second though huzzah I didn't cook the

499
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:17,950
pie it was picking the signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> itals</font>

500
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:21,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">pickin it up too much so this is the</font>

501
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:28,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">other hint as to the solution that I</font>

502
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:30,400
ended up doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out really of off</font>

503
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,260
of the pie and<font color="#CCCCCC"> not offer the rubidium</font>

504
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,570
oscillator itself their ground

505
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,400
references go through not directly to

506
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:42,610
the ground pins all the time through the

507
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:45,190
GPIO bus so in short<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I connected</font>

508
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">all this up I actually had to throw the</font>

509
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,670
ground reference directly back to the

510
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,220
power supply<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was powering the</font>

511
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:53,170
entire kit as opposed to being lazy

512
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,850
about and saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh ground is ground</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

513
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:57,429
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pull it off of the pie or</font>

514
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:59,139
pull it off of the oscillator nope not

515
00:23:57,429 --> 00:24:01,870
in this case I had to actually just pull

516
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:05,830
it directly off of the power supply

517
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:08,290
itself so now I have that nice pulse

518
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:11,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">within the right voltage and it's</font>

519
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:15,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">extended into the window where things</font>

520
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:18,010
were hunky-dory peachy keen instead of

521
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing like that massive reflection I it</font>

522
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:22,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">would pick the signal up twice so I</font>

523
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,460
still had a bit of a reflection issue I

524
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:28,419
got lazy and just threw<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

525
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:31,090
REM pod on to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so once I did</font>

526
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,650
that I was able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sew the reflection</font>

527
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:35,050
would go down it will come back and then

528
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:38,590
hit back down to the PI that second<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

529
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:41,050
was a weaker one and the i<font color="#CCCCCC"> used the</font>

530
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:43,300
zener diode to just throw anything below

531
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:45,850
that voltage level directly to ground

532
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:48,100
life is peachy so all of a sudden now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

533
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:50,110
am now getting pulse per second and the

534
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,419
raspberry<font color="#CCCCCC"> PI's picking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it up I let it</font>

535
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:55,360
run for weeks on end I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get any</font>

536
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:58,060
blue or purple smoke the GPIO bus on the

537
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,070
pi didn't fry I didn't have to move<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

538
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">another pin for like whacking it over</font>

539
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:04,360
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> over again because if you want to</font>

540
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about in some regards don't do</font>

541
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,879
this but if you were to turn to the

542
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">person next to you and just thump them</font>

543
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,800
once every second it gets a little

544
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:14,980
irritating and the way the GPIO bus on

545
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:18,990
the pies are engineered in some way is

546
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:22,540
that strong thump it they'll actually I

547
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:25,690
parallel it to like<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting bruised the</font>

548
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:27,340
electronics wear out from it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was</font>

549
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:30,160
still within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tolerances of it and</font>

550
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,720
everything was fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I had an</font>

551
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,170
intermission at this particular point in

552
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,620
time I lost about three weeks of focus

553
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:39,820
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this project due to work travel kids</font>

554
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:45,100
thinking thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about actually writing</font>

555
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:46,840
on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> PhD which I didn't but the I'll</font>

556
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:51,459
still kind of like in the back of my

557
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:53,230
head I got it to extend a close to 100

558
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,490
milliseconds but not exactly there and

559
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:57,100
I'll still worried that that was going

560
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:59,290
to be a problem so I threw a tweet out

561
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:04,020
nasta for some and some friends

562
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:06,340
responded there's a guy named Tim who

563
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,290
has been a player in our wireless

564
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:11,830
village he's the guy who's rocked the

565
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:15,310
dog shock collar challenge anyone who

566
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:17,320
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play that fair game and then</font>

567
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:19,090
there are some other folks that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

568
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,179
worked in the space that responded back

00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:24,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">to me like Rob from New on and drag horn</font>

00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:31,060
like one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them was to use a 555 timer</font>

573
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:34,000
in order to try to get the PPS from the

574
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:35,860
oscillator to trigger the 555 for it to

575
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,900
then in turn flip the light switch on

576
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:41,250
for a time interval and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

577
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:44,890
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried a variety of these things and</font>

578
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:48,700
they worked but when I started having to

579
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:52,240
rely<font color="#E5E5E5"> on other components in order to do</font>

580
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:55,360
that time delay the ultimate measure for

581
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,770
this was well I might be ringing a

582
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,500
buzzer or having something else reading

583
00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:01,720
the buzzer for me but what is ntp think

584
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:05,470
the actual application ntp think of

585
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:08,980
these sources so i slung it together I

586
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:12,630
got ntp to receive the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PPS and compare</font>

587
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:17,980
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> against what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GPS was giving it so</font>

588
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:20,560
without the the oscillator the raspberry

589
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:23,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">PI's internal clock jitter was worse</font>

590
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:31,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">than the GPS is but the gps is jitter</font>

591
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:31,020
was at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 15 micro seconds with the</font>

592
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,930
rubidium oscillator the pulse per second

593
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:41,410
was point 0 1 micro seconds for jitter

594
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:43,780
so that tell if ntp goes yes this thing

595
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,820
is stable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and awesome then that meant</font>

596
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,580
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i now had the functions of an</font>

597
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:51,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">atomic clock using a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Raspberry Pi in</font>

598
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:53,110
this external oscillator so the other

599
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:57,460
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was interesting was later in</font>

600
00:27:53,110 --> 00:28:02,560
life getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the boot up process to</font>

601
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:05,410
behave correctly and it turns out that

602
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,980
GPS isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> also always the most reliable</font>

603
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">source for getting a pulse per second</font>

604
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:15,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">because weather phenomena can delay it</font>

605
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:18,010
your GPS receiver has a firmware in it

606
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,449
that tries to account for that error so

607
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:22,450
that's like a band-aid to a broader

608
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,650
problem that i experienced solely

609
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:27,520
because of being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to compare it</font>

610
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:30,670
against this other source well<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

611
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:35,230
thing was hearing from Kirino<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how he</font>

612
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:38,140
was doing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> his he had very similar</font>

613
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:41,410
success and stabilizing the pulse per

614
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:44,170
second getting his piety and put it we

615
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:46,630
we worked in isolation but slightly pink

616
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:48,670
each other solely because we wanted to

617
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:50,590
see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other solutions were</font>

618
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:51,220
possible and all that sort of stuff so

619
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,570
we

620
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,850
compare notes and it turns out that we

621
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:58,330
were very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very close to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the exact same</font>

622
00:28:54,850 --> 00:29:00,219
solution from a circuit standpoint but

623
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:05,168
software wise we were exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

624
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:11,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we both had ntp pick up on things</font>

625
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:15,370
wonderfully so we're for me personally

626
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:20,950
like I I don't I'm aid a kernel hack in

627
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:23,439
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fudge some of the razz pies</font>

628
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:26,049
detection of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the PPS i don't really like</font>

629
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,650
doing that ideally<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd like to use some</font>

630
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:31,929
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a circuit to reliably trigger</font>

631
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:34,900
that for me the ones listed there are

632
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:36,280
ones that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've built and tested minus</font>

633
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,700
the i still haven't done the

634
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:43,870
multivibrator yet where's render man

635
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:47,730
when you need them but the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

636
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:47,729
component of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is is I have an external</font>

637
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:56,710
as to like do I have 10 megahertz signal

638
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:58,600
or not ideally I want to use the NB 506

639
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,460
internally already on the same bored

640
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,889
that i'm building for this and then the

641
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:07,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">last stage is to just cram it all in a</font>

642
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:09,549
1u rack case and ultimately like<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

643
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,990
little bit before this presentation I

644
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:13,168
was like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what let's make</font>

645
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:16,539
another Internet of Things thing and

646
00:30:13,169 --> 00:30:20,200
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly hack together something</font>

647
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:24,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">that gives me like a status</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it uses</font>

648
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:27,669

649
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh it's 1231 all right pulse per second</font>

650
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:33,039
directly after 12 31 and then every once

651
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:36,039
in a while at queries gpsd again in

652
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:40,240
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see does my 1231 still match</font>

653
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:44,260
yours and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was solely relying on</font>

654
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:47,559
gps d being the time source for it the

655
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:50,080
ntp would get angry and start saying

656
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:52,658
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> GPS is not precise enough for me to</font>

657
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,720
use it as a stratum 0 or stratum 1 time

658
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:58,510
source it wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use GPS as stratum 2</font>

659
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,909
or stratum 1 but stratum 2 preferably

660
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:03,490
because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of jitter that it was</font>

picking up an association with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">just quickly</font>

663
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:08,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">threw together something that would</font>

664
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:13,890
visibly render the status of the

it's the the no no no it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a it may</font>

668
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:32,510
have had mostly due to maybe noise from

669
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:35,309
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable because it was a serial device</font>

670
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:38,730
as opposed to USB and passing data that

671
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:41,100
way but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was something specifically</font>

672
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,870
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it just didn't like that I</font>

673
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:46,199
could replicate on another device as

674
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:54,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">well may have dropped at one too many</font>

00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:56,760
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes sir rubidium oscillator on</font>

676
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:59,178

677
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:02,640
eighty dollars to two hundred dollars

678
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:04,049
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly because some people</font>

679
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,230
don't realize what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have and what</font>

680
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:08,940
they're selling so you may get lucky

681
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:10,860
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's the $80 end of the</font>

682
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,390

683
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:14,129
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got and it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

684
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:16,309
interesting they'll sell them for about

685
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:19,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">200 bucks when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you buy them brand-new</font>

686
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:23,460
they can be a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> under a thousand</font>

687
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:26,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">bucks I've seen the manufacturer sells</font>

688
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:28,919
them I've seen them with the variety of

689
00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:30,690
features that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have under the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exact</font>

690
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:31,950

691
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:34,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">bucks and goes up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to about a thousand</font>

692

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are and the cell phone towers that</font>

are allowing multiple customers to share

the same frequency because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> tdma or</font>

697
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:53,460
anyways so it's fairly important for

698
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:55,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">those sort of functions and this is just</font>

a fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> little reuse of something else</font>

700
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:00,330
that's out there now the other while

701
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:01,880
researching this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should also</font>

702
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:04,590
note that there are some other videos

00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:07,140
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> other people that played with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">described some of the write-ups is like</font>

706
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:13,200
these people bought this thing in the

707
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,760
mail and they just wanted the lazy plug

708
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,830
it in turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on and everything works</font>

709
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,020
and then they wrote a skating renting

00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,280
actually trying to understand what it

00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:27,620
was or how it worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so so that's</font>

714
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,850
that information is on the end of the

715
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:32,000
spectrum<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the people that don't like</font>

716
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:33,800
it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then on the end of the spectrum</font>

717
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,710
are like some of the ham radio operators

718
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:40,010
that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken this to use in contests</font>

719
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:42,550
for gigahertz radio links and it's good

720
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:45,230
enough for that where they're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

721
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:46,550
have multiple transmitters operating

722
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,870
right next to each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other without them</font>

723
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:51,889
stepping on each other with this cheap

724
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:53,300
little $80 oscillator I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

725
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:57,170
people use them in their work benches

726
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:59,030
for radio experiments and there's this

727
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:02,300
one guy who's actually made this like

728
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:05,120
really crazy steampunk style atomic

729
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:09,168
clock that screams at you what the time

730
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:11,179
is that looks it really looks steampunk

731
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:13,699
ish but his works just fine and its

732
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:18,500
really really neat looking but he

733
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:20,719
enjoyed playing with this device my

734
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,489
personal opinion of reviewing some of

735
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,918
this stuff is that people just weren't

736
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:27,859
really sinking their teeth<font color="#E5E5E5"> in understand</font>

737
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:31,100
what they got they got a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit lazy</font>

738
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:34,899
with some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them or write ups or even</font>

739
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:37,460
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own research</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on it it isn't the</font>

740
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:39,560
that's out there but it works well

741
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,149
enough to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do this other stuff</font>

742
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,590
if you can figure out a band-aid to

743
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:48,980
apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it if you need to and like I</font>

745
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:53,449
getting them off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ebay so your mileage</font>

746
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:55,489
may vary from it but don't give up or be

747
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:56,600
frustrated with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sellers will try</font>

748
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:58,339
to work with you in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

751
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:09,470
experiment that's Alton oh so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now that i</font>

752
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:11,660
got thing at home and i'm starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

753
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:13,899
time sink in my house my my ultimate

754
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:16,910
goal is to no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer have the mismatched</font>

755
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,380
time settings on devices or the

756
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:21,470
microwave of the oven and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my cell phone</font>

757
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:28,970
have like wildly different times set on

758
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:30,919
them but you know the law a regular oven

759
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:32,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a clock on as well but you know</font>

760
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,040
that

761
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:38,590
devices since they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't take an</font>

762
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:44,300
external time source I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

763
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:47,740
additional warrant a near future so at

764
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:50,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">this point I can show you through a</font>

765
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,950
interesting rendering of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page of</font>

766
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:54,830
what the current status of the system is

00:35:51,950 --> 00:36:17,960
otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll take questions if anyone</font>

768
00:35:54,830 --> 00:36:28,880
has them at the moment yes sir you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

769
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:33,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time off yeah yes yeah I did see</font>

770
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that on so now you can actually you're</font>

771
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:41,839
careful you know what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for</font>

772
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:45,710
you yeah and it's just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

773
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:47,750
lucky on that yeah this is as close<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

774
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:49,430
easy sort of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can get so</font>

775
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:53,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> threw some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions on the</font>

776
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:55,160
time nuts mailing list and even back

777
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:58,220
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> those people and digging on the</font>

778
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,720
history of it you still had widely like

779
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:05,959
some people really really liked it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

780
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:21,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">other people really really hated it yeah</font>

781
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:23,420
yeah if he wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of 1 i'll be</font>

782
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:30,589
having these were

783
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:32,089
he forms the third and so one of the

784
00:37:30,589 --> 00:37:35,690
things that will help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you even though</font>

785
00:37:32,089 --> 00:37:39,200
you can't measure it yes take your pack

786
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:47,599
your box and put it in an environment

787
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:50,270
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> it stays breezy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes absolutely ya</font>

788
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,319
know the temperature since the way the

789
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,480
device you're absolutely right because

790
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:55,430
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way the device functions is based</font>

791
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,349
upon an oven that controls the

792
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:59,569
vibrations of the rubidium inside of it

793
00:37:57,349 --> 00:38:07,339
no temperature stability is absolutely

794
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:10,599
key all inside of his lab the glass wall

795
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:14,299
yeah a bunch of custom air conditioner

796
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:16,010
oh yeah not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a I've an</font>

797
00:38:14,299 --> 00:38:20,930
air-conditioned server room that's on

798
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:22,730
its own spot I've got that I've got that

799
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:26,000
covered as well I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> that covered as</font>

800
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:29,089
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's one individual in this room</font>

801
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">that has seen the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> walking us of the hand</font>

802
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:36,078
or household of insanity but actually

803
00:38:33,859 --> 00:38:40,119
that might turn into another talk of the

804
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,119
rabbit hole sort of situation yes sir

805
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:54,760
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices are are forgivable so</font>

806
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:57,180
that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like there they are nowhere</font>

807
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,500
near as accurate as like a cesium clock

808
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:02,350
but they are still accurate enough to

809
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:05,680
within a second of error within a couple

810
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:07,060
hundred thousand years so if you go with

811
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a cesium clock you're going to be</font>

812
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:13,240
adding some zeros to the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

813
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:15,910
hundred thousand years such a lot of

814
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:19,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">zeros so regarding the temperature</font>

815
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:22,600
sensitivity of it the the operational

816
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:24,010
range for it is for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> oven if I</font>

817
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:28,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember correctly it's somewhere</font>

818
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:30,640
between 185 to 190 degrees is where it

819
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:33,640
ideally wants to be within so that five

820
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:38,230
degree temperature drift is more like

821
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:40,000
way overly forgiving<font color="#E5E5E5"> for an environment</font>

822
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:43,030
that is typically housing one of these

823
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices so inside inside a cabinet for a</font>

824
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:47,020
cell phone tower they do have air flow

825
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:49,029
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some refrigeration that's occurring</font>

826
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,890
inside of it which controls it but it's

827
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:53,950
also on that giant skid so based upon

828
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:56,589
the thermal dynamics of the way that

829
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:58,480
they engineered that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cabinet they know</font>

830
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:00,310
by default they're just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

831
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,490
shedding X amount of heat off into the

832
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:06,340
chassis so that it just runs and sits in

833
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:07,930
the Sun because of all the thermal

834
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:10,060
protection between the electronics

835
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,080
inside and the external cabinet I don't

836
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,630
know if you've ever had the opportunity

837
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:17,319
open up and see inside a cell phone

838
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:18,610
tower cabinet thick doors they look

839
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,990
really big on the outside but there's

840
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:22,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a lot of electronics on the inside</font>

841
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:26,950
and it's you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nina standard for</font>

842
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:30,129
ratings of boxes for devices that can be

843
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:31,779
put outside I'm oversimplifying that but

844
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:36,250
they are of a standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can</font>

845
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:40,830
withstand like a lot of moisture a lot

846
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:40,830
of temperature a lot of dust and grit

847
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,120
yeah

848
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,910
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that those cabinets are built</font>

849
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:59,279
is that it's occupying a very small spot

850
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:02,250
inside a broader space that's already

851
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,780
air-conditioned and or doing a bigger

852
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:08,100
amount of passive heating and cooling

853
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:10,940
already so that's another discussion

854
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:13,500
that I'll have with you if you'd like oh

855
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:15,270
yeah you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a part of the</font>

856
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,840
engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their actual installation</font>

more controlled on the inside than you

865
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,700
would imagine

866
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:56,730

the towers themselves is being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

itself the handoff from one customer to

00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:19,330
time pulse is between one to the next

875
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:21,520
when it does the handoff it only cares

about the pulse per second off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

878
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:27,280
that one tower itself in order to be

879
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:30,879
able to squeeze more customers into

880
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,410
narrower time slots but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hand</font>

off to<font color="#E5E5E5"> another one you're going to have</font>

885
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:46,960
towers typically pull their time off of

886
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:49,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the t1 or t3 or ds3 lines from the</font>

888
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:55,330
inside those towers fail on that they

889
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:57,880
also have GPS but because neither of

890
00:42:55,330 --> 00:43:00,759
those mechanisms are good enough for

891
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,380

<font color="#E5E5E5">something that can give precision error</font>

you'll find my ramblings or just email

materials and here's my schematics<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

912
00:44:17,869 --> 00:44:23,539
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gerber to send to ash Park</font>

913
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:26,598
for them to print you a board to solder

914
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:33,019
some components on all that sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

915
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:37,910
that's a fun enjoy yes sir how did that

916
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:39,499
come to that conclusion ntp just

917
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:43,239
triggering on that over and over and

918
00:44:39,499 --> 00:44:46,069
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> and over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again was the symptom and</font>

919
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:48,859
essentially when I jammed the

920
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:52,069
oscilloscope on the exact same pen you

921
00:44:48,859 --> 00:44:55,999
would actually see the signal a boop

922
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:59,390
boop boop boop boop boop boop so that

923
00:44:55,999 --> 00:45:00,709
was in the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> period of one pulse</font>

924
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:02,920
having gone out and then there's

925
00:45:00,709 --> 00:45:05,209
multiple pulses still for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one pulse</font>

926
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,650
going out and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that's not</font>

927
00:45:05,209 --> 00:45:11,660
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's only</font>

928
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:13,670
supposed to be one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those so that was</font>

929
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:17,538
the diagnostic process that i was

930
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:20,809
getting reflection so the reason why is

931
00:45:17,539 --> 00:45:22,279
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm cheap and that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font>

932
00:45:20,809 --> 00:45:24,170
point of this you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just used</font>

933
00:45:22,279 --> 00:45:28,099
the original db9 connection and just

934
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:30,829
sloppily soldered on some extensions and

935
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:33,949
then just straight wires and to

936
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:36,579
breadboard so there's like signal noise

937
00:45:33,949 --> 00:45:38,749
and loss out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the breadboard itself</font>

938
00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:43,099
when I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the point where I was</font>

939
00:45:38,749 --> 00:45:45,799
burning PCBs for this a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of that</font>

940
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:47,210
noise just straight up goes away because

941
00:45:45,799 --> 00:45:49,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're no longer dealing with like</font>

942
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:55,130
alligator clips coming off of a lead

943
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:57,319
that has maybe like four strands<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

944
00:45:55,130 --> 00:46:01,130
the 24 individual the copper just kind

945
00:45:57,319 --> 00:46:02,989
of braided out waukee like my hair is so

946
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:06,529
like that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a good conduct</font>

947
00:46:02,989 --> 00:46:08,299
conductor point so by building the PCB I

948
00:46:06,529 --> 00:46:12,470
got a whole lot of the background

949
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:14,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">nonsense well but it's it's a really</font>

950
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:15,558
stupid simple circuit so far right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

951
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:17,660
I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out I've got like</font>

952
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:19,849
five of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm now trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

953
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:22,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the last point I'm going I want to</font>

954
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:24,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">get all of these onto one board as</font>

955
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:26,930
opposed to having like five different

956
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:28,788
mount points inside the one you case I

957
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:31,660
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it to be one thing and then</font>

958
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:33,559
nicer cabling and all that sort of stuff

959
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:36,710
currently right now the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

960
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:38,390
detecting the the 10 megahertz signal if

961
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:41,680
I pull if I throw the oscilloscope

962
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:44,868
directly on the pen it says 10 megahertz

963
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:49,160
exactly if I measure it off the lead

964
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:53,150
that comes off to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> microcontroller</font>

965
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:55,549
that is doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the comparison there is</font>

966
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:57,829
noise introduced there because that lead

967
00:46:55,549 --> 00:46:59,479
and that run<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the wire is also right</font>

968
00:46:57,829 --> 00:47:01,099
next to the pulse per second wire which

969
00:46:59,479 --> 00:47:04,038
is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> right next to some of the</font>

970
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:06,380
voltage wires so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting additional</font>

971
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:08,239
noise right next to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my ideal</font>

972
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:10,789
solution with this board is that it

973
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:13,069
slides directly into the db9<font color="#CCCCCC"> point port</font>

974
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:16,519
but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the traces that comes off</font>

975
00:47:13,069 --> 00:47:20,079
goes to an SMA connector or some sort of

976
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:22,788
radio specific cable that can then go to

977
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,109
anything external on the box if it's

978
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:25,309
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be on the board with an SMA</font>

979
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:28,729
connector or anything along those lines

980
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:30,559
I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> finished that part yet am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

981
00:47:28,729 --> 00:47:34,129
had mostly because hey actually it

982
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:37,609
probably could is I free time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

983
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:40,519
that's the there is someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who has made</font>

984
00:47:37,609 --> 00:47:42,650
a bit of a daughter board that slides

985
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:45,788
into it where you give it the 19 volts

986
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:49,130
DC n and it's got break out for serial

987
00:47:45,789 --> 00:47:53,749
an LED to display the high the lock

988
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:56,280
