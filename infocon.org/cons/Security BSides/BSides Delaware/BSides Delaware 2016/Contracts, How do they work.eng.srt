no

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,390
I write a lot of contracts even though

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">my day job is doing security I get the</font>

48
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:33,010
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I'm a lawyer I am NOT a</font>

49
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:34,840
juggalo as i said the stroke was funny

50
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:39,220
at some point<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we've hit that</font>

51
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:42,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">point so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our contracts their formal</font>

52
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:46,359
promises they clarify terms that we're

53
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:48,129
agreeing to they define satisfaction of

54
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,480
promises and I know that sounds strange

55
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:55,239
but I promise to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this thing well how</font>

56
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,700
do we know when we're done right<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

57
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:01,120
contract I will sell you my car for five

58
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,760
thousand dollars well how do I know that

59
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,709
we're done you have my car I have five

60
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,989
thousand dollars were there other

61
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:10,180
promises entailed in this in this

62
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:13,480
conversation did I promise something

63
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,360
else did that go away<font color="#E5E5E5"> during our</font>

64
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,250
negotiations because if you've ever sold

65
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,069
especially if you sell consulting

66
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,989
services you know how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

67
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:24,670
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you send them</font>

68
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:27,310
that you send<font color="#E5E5E5"> them a proposal and they</font>

69
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:30,608
go I really like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proposal except for</font>

70
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:33,250
one thing it's too expensive can we can

71
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:34,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can we do something different and the</font>

72
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,859
next thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you've cut a bunch</font>

73
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,130
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they still think they're</font>

74
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:41,139
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you originally proposed and</font>

75
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:43,780
that doesn't work so the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

76
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:45,970
contract is to lock it down and

77
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,040
formalize it and say yeah at one point

78
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,079
we talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that at one point we</font>

79
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,298
talked about a five course dinner you're

80
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:54,160
getting half<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a Big Mac because we're</font>

81
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">paint you're paying one-tenth of what we</font>

82
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,889
originally what we originally talked

83
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:02,530
about so the purpose of a contract is to

84
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:05,950
is to base is to lay all that out in

85
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:07,840
such a way that it's formal so that way

86
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:11,709
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end no one's going but I think</font>

87
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:15,459
you owe me this it's how you assign

88
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:18,180
risks of unknowns who here has ever

89
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:20,950
knocked over a system<font color="#E5E5E5"> during a pen test</font>

90
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,630
I'm the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> person who puts up their</font>

91
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:27,969
hand and amidst that like oh yeah did

92
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:29,770
you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> bns that shop yeah who's</font>

93
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:32,230
responsible like who's responsible that

94
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,849
actually causes business damage

95
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,920
in your country you've got some like

96
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:41,350
while will attend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not break</font>

97
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:42,880
everything we touch if we do we're not

98
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,500
responsible for it like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

99
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,350
responsible but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to help you</font>

100
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:51,010
fix it maybe but if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause you</font>

101
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:54,040
business losses it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not on us let you</font>

102
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:56,920
be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your contract it's the intent to</font>

103
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:02,250
be bound it's a promise<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

104
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:05,710
enforceable so kinds of contracts

105
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:08,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's unilateral which is a promise</font>

106
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:11,349
for performance the first person who

107
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,340
gives me<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten bucks will get this role of</font>

108
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:17,110
this roll of tape it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one promise</font>

109
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:22,659
and performance so the first person

110
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:26,770
asked me ten bucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets the tape then</font>

111
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:30,670
there's bilateral which is a promise for

112
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:32,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">a promise if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spiff rogue just says hey</font>

113
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:35,500
I've got ten bucks i'll give it to you

114
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">for that tape well he's now he's not</font>

115
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,140
offering ten bucks he's offering a

116
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,969
promise to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give me ten bucks and for</font>

117
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,039
some people that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as ten bucks</font>

118
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,900
for other people it's dramatically

119
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,450
different it's substantially less

120
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,370
valuable<font color="#E5E5E5"> but and then there's</font>

121
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,590
quasi-contract there are things that

122
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,980
aren't contracts that still kind of bind

123
00:05:53,590 --> 00:06:00,159
people we have promissory estoppel which

124
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:04,720
is a fancy way of saying I relied<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

125
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,380
your promise<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then there's</font>

126
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:13,000
detrimental reliance which is I relied

127
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:16,150
stupidly on something you said like I

128
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,380
relied on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your validation that this</font>

129
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:24,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">company was handling pci data correctly</font>

130
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:26,230
and therefore I is a bank and suing even

131
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:31,210
though i have no contract with a certain

132
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:33,550
qsa<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm suing them anyway so basic</font>

133
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:36,010
requirements a contract<font color="#E5E5E5"> are questions of</font>

134
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:39,390
a contract is was there<font color="#CCCCCC"> a promise did</font>

135
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:44,200
someone actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> promise to do a thing</font>

136
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:45,820
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what was promised and then was</font>

137
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:50,020
their consideration

138
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:52,630
consideration is value I promise you a

139
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:57,460
thing for a thing both of those promises

140
00:06:52,630 --> 00:07:00,850
may have some value but there has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

141
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,830
something in value and something of at

142
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,080
least minimal value oftentimes contract

143
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:07,780
textbooks will talk about one single

144
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,419
peppercorn or a penny or a dollar

145
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:15,250
doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have significant value</font>

146
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:16,930
just has to have some value<font color="#CCCCCC"> promised</font>

147
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,200
itself is consideration<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a bilateral</font>

148
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:22,630
contract it's a promise<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something</font>

149
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,760
or not do something is<font color="#E5E5E5"> consideration</font>

150
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,719
however what is in consideration is

151
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,280
promising to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you already oh</font>

152
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,580
now when I said I'll give someone this

153
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,960
roll of tape<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't they give me</font>

154
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,900
ten bucks like don't give them the tape

155
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I say well and for another contract</font>

156
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,530
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're next or two bucks will give</font>

157
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,800
you the tape no I already<font color="#E5E5E5"> owed you the</font>

158
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:49,840
tape so that isn't consideration for

159
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,610
that second contract and then the

160
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,359
questions are was the performance

161
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:59,980
actually done we promised something did

162
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get back so breach of contract is</font>

163
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:07,410
when you didn't get what you expected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

164
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:09,880
get I failed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to perform as agreed and</font>

165
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:12,460
there's two kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaches there's</font>

166
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:15,580
material which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

167
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:18,820
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done is so core to the agreement</font>

168
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:22,240
like I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay you for a</font>

169
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,830
penetration test well the penetration

170
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,500
test is probably material to the

171
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,930
contract and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> payment is probably</font>

172
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,780
material to the contract something like

173
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:34,599
it will get delivered on a certain day

174
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:37,150
may or may not be material right a late

175
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:40,450
pentest report may be as good as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a not</font>

176
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:43,718
late pen test report but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

177
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:45,640
paid its material and the importance of

178
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,860
material breach versus in material

179
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,410
breach is what it allows you to do if

180
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:53,320
it's a material<font color="#E5E5E5"> breach the other side</font>

181
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:57,459
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> innocent side gets to say nope I'm</font>

182
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,200
out I don't care if the contract said I

183
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,650
am withdrawing

184
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to do other things now a non</font>

185
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:08,189
material breach say for example I

186
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:11,410
promise in my contract that I will

187
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,940
provide a pen castrum from give you a

188
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:15,390
report and the report will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

189
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,410
confidently written and instead I

190
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,569
subcontract that out to someone who's

191
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,630
like half littering so it's a pen test

192
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:25,510
there's a report and it's just badly

193
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,950
written you might if you want to make

194
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:30,610
that into your like your customer facing

195
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:32,950
letter you may say I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rewrite</font>

196
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,750
this it cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> me an extra five hundred</font>

197
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:38,650
dollars or a thousand dollars to rewrite

198
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:41,290
your your bad performance so while it's

199
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:45,550
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> material breach I can likely get</font>

200
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:47,589
some compensation for that screw up so

201
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:51,430
damages when there is a breach of

202
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:53,020
contract there's expectation if you had

203
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:58,839
done what you said you were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

204
00:09:53,020 --> 00:10:01,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was going to expect this and I can I</font>

205
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,220
can be made whole by saying say for

206
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,280
example i was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to resell this</font>

207
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,140
product on so i buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from you for five</font>

208
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,329
thousand dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a buyer who's</font>

209
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,510
going to pay seven you don't deliver it

210
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:16,240
to me so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deliver it on to my</font>

211
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:17,680
buyer<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expecting two thousand</font>

212
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,380
dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> prize two thousand dollars</font>

213
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,630
profit<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can sue you for the two</font>

214
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,430
thousand dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was expecting that 2</font>

215
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,530
grand<font color="#E5E5E5"> had everything gone as planned I</font>

216
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:31,150
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 grand richer that's</font>

217
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:33,250
expectation sometimes we might not know

218
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:35,920
what that value is so we put it in the

219
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,870
contract and say liquidated damages if

220
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,689
this goes wrong you owe me a thousand

221
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,820
bucks because I we can't calculate what

222
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:46,290
I'm out really so just it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

223
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:48,910
write it now as a thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> bucks and</font>

224
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:52,329
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> another concept of breach of</font>

225
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:53,949
contract is mitigation if I know that

226
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:56,350
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to uphold your end of</font>

227
00:10:53,950 --> 00:11:00,040
the bargain or you don't uphold your end

228
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:03,370
of the bargain I have a duty to attempt

229
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:06,180
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimize my damages usually this is</font>

230
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:08,980
often done in employment contracts I

231
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:14,888
hire you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a thing</font>

232
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:17,560
we don't start because reasons and you

233
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:19,449
go well I was contracted to go do this

234
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,459
work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks but nothing</font>

235
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:24,790
happened and I didn't find<font color="#E5E5E5"> any other</font>

236
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:27,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">work so I pretty much spent two weeks on</font>

237
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:31,269
reddit eating eating nothing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cheetos</font>

238
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:32,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">no you to minimize your losses you</font>

239
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:34,449
should have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like go out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

240
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:36,459
find other work you should have

241
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:40,269
mitigated your damages as opposed to the

242
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:42,130
job that didn't materialize and then

243
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:45,910
there's anticipate<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ori breach which</font>

244
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:49,260
allows me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say you have made no</font>

245
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:52,630
attempts to perform under this and

246
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:54,699
because of your ineffective are

247
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,610
non-existent attempts to perform under

248
00:11:54,699 --> 00:12:01,000
this I think you're not going you cannot

249
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:03,339
finish you cannot actually perform it's

250
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,519
like usually this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> often brought in as</font>

251
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:08,260
things like contracting you said you're

252
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to paint my house and it was going</font>

253
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:13,180
to be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of October it's</font>

254
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,189
halfway through October and you haven't

255
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">shown</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up you haven't even asked me what</font>

256
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:21,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">color paint to use you can't possibly</font>

257
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,920
complete it in time unpacking out

258
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:28,989
because you I am anticipating that

259
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:30,819
you're going to breach I'm out and then

260
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:35,050
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is two other concepts called</font>

261
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:37,000
waiver and latches which is in the

262
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:40,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">performance of the contract there are</font>

263
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,639
certain ways that one<font color="#E5E5E5"> side does not make</font>

264
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:45,310
does not fulfill all the needs and the

265
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:49,839
other side doesn't care enough to call

266
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:52,060
it out we call that waiver where say for

267
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,980
example you promise something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done</font>

268
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,949
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a certain date it shows up two days</font>

269
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,480
later if I don't if I don't call<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

270
00:12:56,949 --> 00:13:01,660
out if I don't say<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I was two days</font>

271
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,399
late that's that's a problem if we keep

272
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:07,480
on doing it where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's always two days</font>

273
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:09,850
late eventually i'm not able to say oh

274
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,459
yeah six weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago that was two days</font>

275
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,889
late i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> paying because we've waived</font>

276
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:19,109
it I've been called it out I haven't

277
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:21,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">said anything so</font>

278
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,290
before I start<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about actual</font>

279
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:25,990
kinds of contracts I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out</font>

280
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,939
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting clever with contracts is</font>

281
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:30,069
not always a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea a lot of people</font>

282
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:33,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask me to write really just nasty</font>

283
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:35,649
contracts with ugly penalty clauses and

284
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:39,910
the like and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I try to school them not to</font>

285
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:43,569
because unfair one-sided contracts don't

286
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,920
help anybody for this reason and i'm

287
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:47,319
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give an example like hiding</font>

288
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,149
terms under other headers if you read a

289
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:51,939
contract it usually has a header for

291
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:55,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk like non-disclosure you may not</font>

292
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,269
disclose anything you learn under this

293
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:01,810
because it's important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us thank you</font>

294
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:04,180
if you hide another clause in that

295
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:06,628
header like non-disclosure and

296
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,319
assignment of intellectual property

297
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:10,120
because you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to breeze through</font>

298
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:11,589
and go oh yeah non-disclosure

299
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,240
non-disclosures non-disclosure don't

300
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:18,100
care but if you hide something else

301
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:20,800
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a dick and it means that if</font>

302
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,930
you're willing if you're willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

303
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,839
that in the contract first thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

ya over brought assigning of unrelated

316
00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:00,430
rights I've seen this in a bunch of

317
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:04,000
contracts like all intellectual property

a pain in the ass to work with and the

326
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:25,629
takeaway<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have is this is the first</font>

327
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:28,509
time you get to see how the working

328
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:31,810
relationships going to work if they're

329
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:34,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a pain in the ass now</font>

330
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:38,079
four weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this they're going to be</font>

331
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:40,870
horrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sometimes you take a look</font>

332
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their contract and you go this tells</font>

333
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:45,640
me bad things about you you're going to

334
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:49,689
be a pain you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to screw</font>

335
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:51,730
me and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking of a few friends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

336
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,380
are dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this where someone sold</font>

337
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:56,740
them some you know someone brought them

338
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:59,529
in to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some work and everything was</font>

339
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:01,240
cool they did the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and then it was</font>

340
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:03,880
like yes we'd like to be paid we'd like

341
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,490
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be paid our expenses for this and the</font>

342
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:11,470
person who brought the men's like uh

343
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:13,570
yeah about that things and some people

344
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,750
require the threat of a lawsuit to pay

345
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:20,410
up some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't pay even after the</font>

346
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:23,310
suits been settled you know the Donald

347
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:26,290
Trump argument like yes screw you know I

348
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:28,680
may provide you may provide the<font color="#CCCCCC"> services</font>

349
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:31,930
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying you until you make me and</font>

350
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,609
the problem is is that if you know going

351
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,469
in when you see the contract as being

352
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:38,190
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-sided means they're planning on</font>

353
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:41,350
screwing you and it makes sense to say

354
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:43,780
maybe I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> hold off maybe I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

355
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,580
renegotiate the contract or if you are

356
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,860
you know thankfully in our industry

357
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,780
where there might be another contract

358
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,430
just waiting to happy you go nope not

359
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:55,209
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> business with you maybe you should</font>

360
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:58,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find someone more desperate so</font>

361
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:59,530
getting clever the contracts continue

362
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,880
these are ways of being clever with

363
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:05,500
contracts<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are actually helpful and</font>

364
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:10,720
I call this<font color="#E5E5E5"> acceptable cleverness the</font>

365
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:14,050
brown Eminem<font color="#E5E5E5"> clause those of you who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

366
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:19,600
under the age of 35 there was once a

367
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:22,149
band called van Halen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what makes</font>

368
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:26,079
them important is that they were one of

369
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:29,440
the first big arena rock shows prior<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

370
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,500
them even Big Show's might be all their

371
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,290
equipment might fit in two or three

372
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:39,100
18-wheel trucks<font color="#CCCCCC"> Van Halen's show was</font>

373
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:42,060
like 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> 18 wheel trucks and they</font>

374
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:44,760
required certain engineering

375
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:47,399
capabilities for the building as they

376
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,620
and it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold this much weight we</font>

377
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:54,270
need this much power we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> this much</font>

378
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:55,379
crew and constant promoters sleazy

379
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,450
creatures that they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're just</font>

380
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">signed whatever contract and there's a</font>

381
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:03,300
case where that Hale and stage show

382
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,060
actually damaged the property because it

383
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,710
wasn't built to hold the weight so David

384
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,860
Lee Roth the lead singer comes up the

385
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:12,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea of in this contract and the</font>

386
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,939
contract rider is like 85 pages because

387
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,649
it's also all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> specs like here's</font>

388
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,810
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power has to be here's how the</font>

389
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,460
lights have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set up here's this</font>

390
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:23,580
this this and this and they put a clause

391
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:27,750
in that said there will be a bowl of

392
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:32,490
M&MS in the dressing room there will be

393
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:34,410
no brown M&MS in that bowl and many

394
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:37,190
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> when first seeing this go oh god</font>

395
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:40,260
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rock-star</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretentiousness</font>

396
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:43,380
instead it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very quick way of</font>

397
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,870
determining whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you actually</font>

398
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:49,430
read the requirements and are producing

399
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:52,679
something that I can work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with right</font>

400
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:54,810
David Lee Roth can't run you know he

401
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:58,050
can't have its own crew go and check

402
00:18:54,810 --> 00:19:00,720
power you can't check the engineering of

403
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:03,530
engineering specs on the building but

404
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,620
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to go no brown M&MS</font>

405
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:10,560
they read the contract I'm a fan of the

406
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:15,270
tech version of that the RFC 1149

407
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:16,980
requirements for any network gear some

408
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:20,400
of you laugh some of you should look it

409
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,200
up its IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> over avian carrier and there</font>

410
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,350
is nothing like putting that in a

411
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,670
requirement to see what happens because

412
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,189
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a sales guy was like oh of</font>

413
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:34,100
course it's RFC 1149 compliant there's a

414
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:36,390
sales engineer going he's it at you I

415
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:39,209
the guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is we're trying to sell this</font>

416
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,940
to is clearly an asshole he's smiling

417
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:45,060
and I don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I don't know why and</font>

418
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:47,640
you watch the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sales engine going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

419
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:52,169
get back to you on that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

420
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:55,470
that parade I was a tape a robot tape

421
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:57,260
library and it's like is it RFC 1149 and

422
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:00,880
the sales guy was like

423
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:04,370
course it is and part of the job no I

424
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,810
would just get back because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's asking</font>

425
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,639
us we had some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other requirements we</font>

426
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:10,940
wanted as well they would ago of course

427
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:16,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's firewire compatible it's cozy sup</font>

428
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:18,440
firewire so make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

429
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:22,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">everybody's actually read like if you</font>

430
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:25,340
have specific weird requirements like

431
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:29,800
you have a union requirement for for

432
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,800
your prevailing wage or you've got

433
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,770
nationality requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't have</font>

434
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,000
any non-americans on the contract<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

435
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:36,550
something like that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make</font>

436
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,370
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they've read that weirdo</font>

437
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:43,159
requirement now instead of going three

438
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:47,629
weeks then were like oh did you mean

439
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:51,010
that yeah yeah you did so quickly do

440
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,010
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that should make them laugh</font>

441
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,830
that's common it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> common to see</font>

442
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,550
recycled contract languages especially

443
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:51,250
in this industry I've read my favorite

444
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:53,889
is one that i got from someone in the

445
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:59,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">community was like i'm trying to sell</font>

446
00:21:53,890 --> 00:22:03,550
services to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> midsize company in in the</font>

447
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:06,428
space and i read the contract like are

448
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:09,010
these guys hooked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with yahoo because</font>

449
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:10,240
all sometimes the contract specifies

450
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,740
saying the company other times it

451
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,190
specifies y'all I'm like are they yahoo

452
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:17,230
subsidiary and like we're like I don't

453
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">know why why you know yahoo has a</font>

454
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:21,640
subsidiary in<font color="#CCCCCC"> allentown I don't know and</font>

455
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,530
then we finally asked the opposing

456
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,320
counsel and it's like oh yeah we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

457
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:28,389
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> the boilerplate from Yahoo's terms</font>

458
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,110
of service like have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you heard of find</font>

459
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:33,940
and replace I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just recommend that</font>

460
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:36,010
i found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like he build he built his</font>

461
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,660
clients in like twenty eight thousand

462
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:42,970
dollars to write that contract like I'm

463
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:46,500
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong business so other things</font>

464
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:51,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do with contracts is hedging risk</font>

465
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:53,559
indemnification in the case of say for

466
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,630
example you're doing your operating is

467
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:58,750
like a qsa or<font color="#E5E5E5"> your operating is an</font>

468
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:01,660
auditor and you audit a system you audit

469
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:07,929
accompany you audit you audit and

470
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:10,510
application they may ask you to say if

471
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:12,340
you certify it as good or you you

472
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,679
identify the flaws and we fix all those

473
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:18,129
flaws and it still gets breached and it

474
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:22,059
causes us damage we want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover</font>

475
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:24,400
our costs that's indemnification this

476
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:27,970
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> dangerous especially if you're a</font>

477
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,860
small shop hold harmless is this is a

478
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,960
slightly less painful version of this

479
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:35,559
which just says you won't sue me for

480
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:37,419
this oftentimes I put I try to put this

481
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:38,168
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen test contracts that I right where</font>

482
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:40,389
it's

483
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:45,909
you will hold us harmless for our

484
00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:48,189
activities in scope if we if we if we

485
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:51,730
knock over a<font color="#E5E5E5"> system that you told us to</font>

486
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:55,690
test and instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us getting shell we</font>

487
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:57,519
just dropped it you can't sue us for it

488
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,570
will do every attempt<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know</font>

489
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,759
usually when I've language it says

490
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:04,809
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we we will do everything</font>

491
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:08,919
we can to not break it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do you</font>

492
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:11,139
can't go after us for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it liquidated</font>

493
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,749
damages I don't know what my losses

494
00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:17,408
maybe but let's set them now if this

495
00:24:13,749 --> 00:24:20,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you pay me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X instead of how us</font>

496
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:24,489
having to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have later discussions about</font>

497
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:27,879
it a limitation on damages<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if I</font>

498
00:24:24,489 --> 00:24:30,100
break everything let's limit it at five

499
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:31,600
hundred dollars or ten thousand dollars

500
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,889
or whatever you're willing to whatever

501
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,199
the two sides are willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to agree to</font>

502
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:37,689
but it's a hedging of the risk I don't

503
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,119
know what the damages may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be let's set</font>

504
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:42,009
them we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just fix them with</font>

505
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:47,738
liquidated damages we can cap them with

506
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:51,519
a limitation clause and this snags so

507
00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:57,669
many shops somewhere in that contract

508
00:24:51,519 --> 00:25:03,330
you agree to<font color="#CCCCCC"> follow missed 853 or 171</font>

509
00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:06,850
are you you attest to being<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISO</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 27001</font>

510
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:08,619
and it's always hidden there the amount

511
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:12,428
of ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've read that have crazy</font>

512
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:16,570
requirements like you're both FedRAMP

513
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:20,109
and PCI requirements for a shop that

514
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:22,658
writes software that doesn't touch

515
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:24,369
payment card are federally mandated data

516
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:27,669
but they'll put that requirement in

517
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:29,649
there it's a way of me if I'm right in

518
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:32,139
contract hedging that you may lose my

519
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:36,158
data you'll fit these that meet these

520
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:39,129
requirements usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> will also pen in an</font>

521
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,590
audit clause that allows me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check to</font>

522
00:25:39,129 --> 00:25:44,109
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you're doing that this is more</font>

523
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:49,709
common in a something<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a service</font>

524
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:49,710
market but it's something there

525
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:55,440
other clauses you'll see in contracts or

526
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:58,830
how do we handle an eventual dispute we

527
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,720
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a choice of law any dispute</font>

528
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:04,320
under this happens under the laws of

529
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,540
Delaware or some other state you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

530
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,610
pick one that you you think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how</font>

531
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:11,750
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go out that way there's no</font>

532
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:14,820
surprises you can do a choice of venue

533
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:18,620
to prevent say for example i<font color="#CCCCCC"> am a</font>

534
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:23,100
pennsylvania corporation you ate of a

535
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:26,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">colorado company hires me I say choices</font>

536
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:29,550
venue is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pennsylvania so that way I</font>

537
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:34,650
don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to Colorado if this</font>

538
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:37,230
goes sour arbitration and mediation

539
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:40,830
clauses oftentimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll see these in</font>

540
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:44,600
there to essentially require some step

541
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:46,770
before actual actual court litigation

542
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,230
oftentimes though these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> one sided</font>

543
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:51,270
one side will require arbitration but

544
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:55,830
not bind themselves to arbitration if

545
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:57,780
they choose to<font color="#E5E5E5"> initiate it other things</font>

546
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:59,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">like control of information and these</font>

547
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,830
are his concepts you'll see there the

non-disclosure agreement all<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

lot when you're talking like large

marketing I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be seeing more of</font>

00:27:54,690 --> 00:28:02,770
this where you grant rights about your

example and I've seen this in the field

570
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:10,150
where like a network manufacturer says

571
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,370
we've just sold you a million<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars of</font>

that how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever done</font>

really good open source in open source

578
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:30,400
intelligent using marketing white papers

579
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:33,520
I know I have there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing like</font>

580
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:36,550
showing someone the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network map of their</font>

581
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,550
their SCADA environment by showing a

582
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:41,710
vendor presentation on it no like that's

583
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:43,300
that's the only secret information like

584
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:45,280
no google gave me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because the</font>

00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:54,750
vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> of presentation so it's a way of</font>

588
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,920
controlling information you're giving

589
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,720
assignment of intellectual property if

590
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:06,070
you develop any intellectual property

591
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:07,990
under this contract whose is it so you

592
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,909
have like<font color="#CCCCCC"> work-for-hire</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where any</font>

593
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:13,210
intellectual property you create while

594
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:19,480
you're working for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us is ours we paid</font>

595
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:23,470
you it's ours so how to interpret

596
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:27,130
contracts there's ambiguity I don't know

597
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:28,990
what that term means and you look for

598
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:30,610
defined terms in me in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the</font>

599
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:33,610
related contracts if you have multiple

600
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:35,439
contracts if you've defined the term you

601
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:38,979
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the customary definition in the</font>

602
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:43,450
trade or business I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen some shops</font>

603
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:45,820
that will try to bend this as in a

604
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:49,030
certain large information security

605
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:51,159
vendor that believes that a koala scan

606
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:53,830
plus manual verification is a

607
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:57,220
penetration test that is in their

608
00:29:53,830 --> 00:30:00,280
language if you actually want someone to

609
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:05,430
get shell on your system or to pivot

610
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:07,629
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the advanced penetration test so</font>

611
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:10,300
but that's in their contracts and

612
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:15,330
they're like 60 page contracts so the

613
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:17,740
only people reading them are lawyers who

614
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:23,040
might not get the night might not

615
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:25,270
immediately sneer at that so yep so if

616
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,399
we don't have to find terms in the

617
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:29,620
contract if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not clear on the</font>

618
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,510
customary definition the court will

619
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,219
often just say whatever's commercially

620
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:37,960
reasonable interpretation of what that

621
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:40,660
term is so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they background on</font>

622
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,400
contracts half hour contracts for a

623
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:46,050
course it's usually a whole year in law

624
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:49,530
school<font color="#E5E5E5"> so contracts that affect us</font>

625
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:51,820
employment we all like being employed

626
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:53,800
usually employment contracts while the

627
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,899
non-disclosure clause a nondisclosure

628

agreement I will not reveal what I have

you have obtained during your employment

a non-compete after working<font color="#CCCCCC"> from here</font>

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,879
you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not attempt to hire people for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">competitors for a certain amount of time</font>

641
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:40,180
and the relative enforceability of this

642
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:42,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">depends what comes what what state</font>

643
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:47,260
you're in for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> California has</font>

644
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:49,260
fairly it restricts non-competes in ways

645
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:51,370
that we don't on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> East Coast</font>

646
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,960
non-competes<font color="#E5E5E5"> had p from the east coast</font>

647
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:56,649
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have as much teeth in</font>

648
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">California so that's why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go for the</font>

00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:01,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">choice of law choice of venue question</font>

650
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:03,630
in the original contract ago should I

651
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:06,310
worry about this non-compete

652
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:09,310
work-for-hire intervention and sign mins

653
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:12,850
I've seen some ugly ones of these where

654
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:17,110
an invention you come up with six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font>

655
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:20,379
after you've left is ours unless you can

656
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:24,189
show that you never thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

657
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:26,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">like how do you show that like I am not</font>

658
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:28,179
so I so anal retentive that I take

659
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,500
shower notes

660
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:33,590
you know what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that you have</font>

661
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:35,059
that realization as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you know you</font>

662
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:38,330
know as your as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're washing yourself</font>

663
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:41,389
like wait a minute that might work but

664
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:45,309
how would I prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my employer that I</font>

665
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:45,309
didn't come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that on their time</font>

666
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:51,969
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're starting when</font>

667
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:55,908
you're when you're negotiating a

668
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:57,890
negotiating a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> new job there'll be a</font>

669
00:32:55,909 --> 00:33:01,429
declarations page these are my

670
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:09,159
inventions I walk in with them i'm

671
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:12,440
walking out with them at will employment

672
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:16,220
means they can fire you for any reason

673
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:19,610
or no reason even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is an</font>

employment contract with them the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual</font>

675
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:25,490
can we end it yeah either side can end

676
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:29,600
it at any time if it says at will most

677
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:31,940
contracts usually are so second kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

678
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">employment contract i'll go through is</font>

679
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:38,330
the termination or exit agreement you've

680
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:41,299
decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave it may be a mutual</font>

681
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:43,129
decision it may be unilateral maybe your

682
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:48,408
employer is really tired of looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

683
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:51,590
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as such well they will ask you</font>

684
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:54,770
to leave and usually especially in this

685
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:58,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">field they'll ask you like look we would</font>

686
00:33:54,770 --> 00:34:02,960
like you to sign another contract that

687
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:04,190
by doing so you give up any rights you

688
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,980
had to an employment discrimination

689
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:09,619
lawsuit any<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions we still owe you</font>

690
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:11,330
money any question about anything else

00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:14,869
we owe you an exchange will give you

00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:17,989
severance we will extend your health

693
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:20,839
insurance will give you a thing the last

694
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:22,908
job<font color="#CCCCCC"> i left oddly enough one of the</font>

695
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:24,710
promises they gave was two monitors I

696
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:27,830
mean they're nice like 22 inch<font color="#E5E5E5"> nails</font>

697
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:30,649
like hey that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool and that was a part</font>

698
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:34,549
of my exit agreement but this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> final</font>

699
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:36,618
attempt<font color="#E5E5E5"> to renegotiate things however</font>

700
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:38,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">they can add things into the exit</font>

701

agreement that weren't in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

702
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,480
employment contract

703
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:45,389
so even though you may have walked in

704
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,730
with your invention assignment the exit

705
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:50,010
agreement may rescind that because it's

706
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:52,500
essentially a renegotiation to be

707
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:55,139
careful<font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes they'll have</font>

708
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:59,270
non-disparagement you can't talk

709
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:59,270
about us we can't talk about you

710
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:06,359
assistance this is a fairly common 1 i'm

711
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:08,130
seeing this getting actually used for if

712
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:10,950
you haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> fully documented your code</font>

713
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:16,550
or you have some chunk of information

714
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:19,169
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a client situation or environment</font>

715
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:21,630
there will often be an assistance clause

716
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:26,940
that says they can essentially rehire

717
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:32,010
you as a contractor you agree to this to

718
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:34,140
get them over that hump I've seen it

719
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:36,569
often threatened mark because you know

720
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:39,058
you're getting the hey how does this

721
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:42,450
work screw you I left<font color="#E5E5E5"> three months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

722
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:45,569
but you remember there's a trick to it

723
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:48,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell me what it is and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know they</font>

724
00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:51,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">can threaten with we just rehire you is</font>

725
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,059
we can force you to come back and do the

726
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:58,790
thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes you'll just divulge</font>

727
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:58,790
ical yeah it's up down up down a be a be

728
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:05,098
so business contracts so you've gone

729
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:06,780
from being an employee to maybe you're

730
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:10,920
negotiating on behalf of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your company</font>

731
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:12,630
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you running a company non-disclosure</font>

732
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,299
agreements usually the first of what I

733
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:17,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">think of is is the flirting part of the</font>

734
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:20,790
relationship all you're doing is saying

735
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:22,740
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to divulge some information we</font>

736
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:24,660
have no business relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass this</font>

737
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:27,558
it is merely<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I want to be able to</font>

738
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:32,160
talk freely about what I'm trying to do

739
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:34,890
so non-disclosure second one and this is

740
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,759
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a in a contracting or consulting</font>

741
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:41,490
role the master service agreement this

742
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:47,069
establishes all the rules by which we're

743
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:49,290
going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> business right it doesn't</font>

744
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:50,940
say what we're going to do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

745
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,680
things like

746
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:56,920
how are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get paid if you</font>

747
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">choose if we do something are you going</font>

748
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:05,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get paid on invoice is it going to be</font>

749
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:08,590
net 30 net 90 based on a retainer how so

750
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:12,130
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all the rules about every</font>

751
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:14,410
subsequent contract goes through the MSA

752
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:16,750
so it's essentially how are we going to

753
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:18,430
do business<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the first if you want</font>

754
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:21,100
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of this is like a networking</font>

755
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:22,750
thing it's the handshake this

756
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:26,860
establishes all the rules by which

757
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:28,420
future business will happen but it

758
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:31,360
doesn't describe what we're doing it

759
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:35,980
just says if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do a thing this is the</font>

760
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:38,320
this is the master<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in terms of</font>

761
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:40,900
payment assigning risks the actual

762
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:45,040
performance is in another contract the

763
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:47,830
statement of work those of you are

764
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,590
consultants if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not learned this</font>

765
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:52,720
yet this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first thing you read</font>

766
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:56,650
when you're told oh yeah you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font>

767
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,810
thing to do I don't talk to the sales

768
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">rep who sold it I don't talk to any of</font>

769
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,619
the engineers who are currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

770
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:04,680
on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read the statement of work as I</font>

771
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:09,580
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know what did we actually</font>

772
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:13,000
promised to do and I mean by read it I

773
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:15,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean print it out and circle things that</font>

774
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,760
you're like what does this mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

775
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,550
to one shop I work for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

776
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,690
writing the contracts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and selling them</font>

777
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:27,010
would put in phrases that had no meaning

778
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:31,480
weevil one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our deliverables was</font>

779
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:35,050
always a possibilities matrix what's the

780
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:38,470
possibilities matrix I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

781
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:41,770
either so every one of my deliverables

782
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:43,419
had section whatever possibilities

783
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:47,290
matrix and it was like a four by four

784
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:48,730
matrix about possibilities and I

785
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:50,140
realized it was like a way of saying

786
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:52,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to sell you all these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

787
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:54,279
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know like but this is actually if no</font>

788
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:59,200
value but we promised you a bunch of

789
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:01,270
things but that's the that's the

790
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,759
statement of work is all the things are

791
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,150
actually promising on doing and all the

792
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">things</font>

793
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:09,460
promising to do for you as in payment or

794
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:13,089
anything else you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting from</font>

795
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:15,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">them the SLA the service the service</font>

796
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:19,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">level agreement how quickly will you</font>

797
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:22,270
respond what is your up time so this is

798
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">less about kind of contracting more like</font>

799
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:26,980
if you're bringing on something as a

800
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:28,750
service this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is essentially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your bought</font>

801
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:31,450
these two though are essentially the if

802
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:33,849
you have a conflict<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the person</font>

803
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:36,549
you've contracted with this is the first

804
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:45,760
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you read and you reread it to</font>

805
00:39:36,549 --> 00:39:47,859
figure out who's out of line so those

806
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,460
are you work in healthcare this is a

807
00:39:47,859 --> 00:39:54,839
scary scary thing business associate

808
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:58,539
agreement it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not merely a contract</font>

809
00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:01,328
this is now actually by signing a

810
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:05,380
business associate agreement you are

811
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:12,579
certifying that you comply with HIPAA

812
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:14,319
and the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times I cbas get</font>

813
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:16,630
signed by consulting companies who are

814
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:19,240
doing work that should not be business

815
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:22,270
associates under HIPAA but they sign it

816
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:24,490
anyway because you want the sale all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

817
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:29,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">sudden</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now you're promising that your</font>

818
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:31,868
own internal processes are best practice

819
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:36,029
who here thinks their own internal

820
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:39,579
processes are best practice right

821
00:40:36,029 --> 00:40:42,160
there's not yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I remember this</font>

like clear desk clear screen as a

823
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:48,250
requirement and I'm like well there is a

824
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:52,119
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a desk and a screen under these</font>

825
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:53,680
piles of paper and equipment because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

826
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:55,690
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wouldn't pass</font>

827
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,609

834
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,650
because it essentially says I'm agreeing

835
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:19,839
to follow<font color="#CCCCCC"> hit</font>

836
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:21,760
high-tech security and privacy rules and

837
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:26,319
you're like yeah but I'm a consulting

838

842
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:43,869
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> desk it may have fallen off so</font>

843
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:45,399
you you're now ascribing to all those

844
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:51,279
things that you expect someone else to

845
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:53,380
do you're like oh yeah our it's an often

846
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:55,270
will be I've seen this especially for

847
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,670
doing work with really really large

848
00:41:55,270 --> 00:42:00,910
healthcare organizations like hospital

849
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:02,170
chains are health insurers is that not

850
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:05,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">only do you say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

851
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:07,510
follow HIPAA they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to also</font>

852
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:11,380
publish their own more rigorous security

853
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:13,510
rules and you're filling out that the

854
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,890
vendor assessments that you often send

855
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:18,029
out you're like wait a min i have to

856
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:23,109
follow this I have to do these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

857
00:42:18,029 --> 00:42:27,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a peasant know so those contracts</font>

858
00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:31,538
are dangerous they have to encrypt your

859
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:34,210
email yep the best one was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you have</font>

863
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:44,348
on my browser because reasons you're

864
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:50,919
like do you have a one you recommended

<font color="#CCCCCC">like s none of them so these are</font>

866
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:58,720
dangerous be careful I find even though

867
00:42:56,589 --> 00:43:01,058
I've done this where I try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> explain to</font>

868

00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:16,600
stuck into a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> master services</font>

896

agreements where the client expects you

to indemnify them for any damages you

898
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:27,080
may cause or you fail to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find and it's</font>

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,710
and cover their costs you can I mean if

903
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:41,720
you've got 20 million dollars in the

bank to indemnify as an indemnification

905

fun go for it otherwise you're going to

906
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:49,310
an insurance company who may now require

907
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:52,430
that they view your stuff to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

908

00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:05,000
to get those into master services

912
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:08,660

you're defining the the the work you

917
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:24,770
want it to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very specific if it's</font>

if you're doing a scan and pen test the

00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:30,350
following<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP addresses are in scope you</font>

920
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:34,670
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it very clear this is what</font>

I'm hitting if that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen or it</font>

922
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:38,960
gets changed right oh yeah we<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in</font>

923
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:40,150
these new systems and we toured these

924
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,859
out because

925
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:43,660
we wrote the statement of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for</font>

926
00:45:41,859 --> 00:45:45,910
months ago we<font color="#CCCCCC"> couldn't get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an approved</font>

927
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:47,470
we've changed our infrastructure between

928
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:50,710
then and now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't want to</font>

929
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:52,808
change it so there might be some kind of

930
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:55,589
meat kickoff meeting you'll have where

931
00:45:52,809 --> 00:45:58,599
you essentially renegotiate the scope

932
00:45:55,589 --> 00:46:00,250
get them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign it if only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say send</font>

933
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:02,619
it from their email like we agree this

934
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:04,480
is the new scope or this modifies the

935
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:07,150
scope and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the statement of work because</font>

936
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,779
and keep beating this up you want the

937
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:15,369
scope of what work you're doing to be

938
00:46:09,779 --> 00:46:17,440
clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> often times you'll have the</font>

00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:20,710
meeting those who also space<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay things</font>

940
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:24,010
stick say things like when when may I

941
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:28,210

977
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:15,619
identify the ownership of the stuff

you're testing view of it if your client

979

pen testing their stuff but they react

983
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:41,720
badly to this because otherwise it's an

984
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:44,000
attack sometimes a redirect takes you

985
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:47,029
over the line I found this during a pen

986
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:52,430
test something that was in scope was

987
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:57,410
actually hosted elsewhere I went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

root directory by doing that you know go

989
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:02,180
up the web server to hopefully find the

someone else's box which i owned looked

992

at the IP and went that's not ours that

993
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:15,079
was Rackspace's I should go explain to

994
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:18,260
rackspace what I just did sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> um yeah</font>

00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:39,618
this way think of how Amazon or

1009
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:59,610
that's why scope is so important<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1010
00:49:55,890 --> 00:50:02,710
breaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a system that is in scope is</font>

1011
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:04,060
just a bad day for them if you've

1012
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:06,790
written this correctly<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

1013
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:09,400
indemnified if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I break into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a system</font>

1014
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:13,300
that is out of scope I have now

1015
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:15,510
committed a felony a felony does not

1016
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:18,010
look good on your permanent record

1017
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:22,150
prevents criminal and civil liability if

1018
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:25,180
your scope is good so say for example

1019
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:29,320
now going back to contracts what happens

1020
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:31,299
when there's a conflict they believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1021
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:35,020
haven't performed they don't like what

1022
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:36,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're saying and it goes from argument</font>

1023
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:39,670
to all the sudden people aren't

1024
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:42,670
accepting meeting invites that's that's

1025
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:45,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">when my blood runs cold like uh-oh I can</font>

1026
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:48,280
no ones on the status call no response

1027
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:52,660
with thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> my you know status</font>

1028
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:54,580
spreadsheet about what I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done so you</font>

1029
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:56,649
know there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem what can you do</font>

1030
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:59,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">you might be able to renegotiate you</font>

1031
00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:02,260
talk to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> principles involved and say</font>

1032
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:05,950
this project<font color="#E5E5E5"> has somehow gone off the</font>

1033
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:09,430
rails how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep this going do we</font>

1034
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:11,859
extend scope do we extend time do we

1035
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:13,390
change the amount of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved do</font>

1036
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:17,590
we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something how do we keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1037
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:19,299
business relationship fine might I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1038
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:21,420
to offer something new on both sides

1039
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:24,910
essentially it's a whole new contract

1040
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:26,560
you want to identify the breach and the

1041
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:30,009
breach is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the breaching contract what</font>

1042
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:32,049
did what what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you promise to do that</font>

1043
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:34,330
you didn't do what<font color="#E5E5E5"> did they promise to</font>

1044
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:36,340
do that they didn't do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1045
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:38,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">fighting about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you want to figure</font>

1046
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:42,730
out how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how you can fix that how</font>

1047
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:45,279
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> cure that problem this is now</font>

1048
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:48,280
getting uglier<font color="#CCCCCC"> you vas it like they have</font>

1049
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,930
breached their side so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> say I</font>

1050
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:53,110
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you won't continue</font>

1051
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:55,750
performing we're out anticipatory breach

1052
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:58,330
you will not do what you're supposed to

1053
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:59,980
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a material fact you're not going</font>

1054
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:01,650
to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> us you're not going to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1055
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:04,440
project done on time

1056
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:07,440
you haven't done coke or things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it</font>

1057
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:11,160
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> out like the extreme one of these</font>

1058
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:13,200
is all of a sudden your badges no longer

1059
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:16,828
work at the job site because they have

1060
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:22,379
basically told you<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've all you all get</font>

1061
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:25,410
help threaten lawsuit this is now things

1062
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:27,630
have spiraled into stupid after their

1063
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:30,868
spiraling into stupid because you've

1064
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:32,520
gone from we were making them happy

1065
00:52:30,869 --> 00:52:35,130
we're making them relatively happy at

1066
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:37,770
this point no one on the technical teams

1067
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:39,539
and other side is talking this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is maybe</font>

1068
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:41,730
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> prince if you're the principal of</font>

1069
00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:43,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">your shop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking and you're now</font>

1070
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:45,930
not talking to the technical people

1071
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:48,089
you're likely talking to people in the

1072
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:50,669
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> management or maybe legal</font>

1073
00:52:48,089 --> 00:52:53,788
you're now fighting over whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1074
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:55,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at all like</font>

1075
00:52:53,789 --> 00:52:59,460
this might be the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the business</font>

1076
00:52:55,079 --> 00:53:01,170
relationship and then you've gone from

1077
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,789
threatening<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lawsuit you've written a</font>

1078
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:04,890
couple letters or your turnings have

1079
00:53:02,789 --> 00:53:07,470
written some letters you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> file</font>

1080
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:10,740
Los someone files a suit about this all

1081
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:12,359
of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now it's you're no longer</font>

1082
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:19,140
really worrying about getting paid

1083
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:22,430
you're worrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> about escaping so any</font>

1084
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:22,430
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> on contracts</font>

1085
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:38,900
okay its third parties if if i say i'm

1086
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:41,379
holding hold harmless means we're not

1087
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:44,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to sue each other under this</font>

1088
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:47,990
indemnification means that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

1089
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:49,940
else Sue's me you're stepping in right

1090
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:52,700
you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> promised to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do a thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for me</font>

1091
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:55,160
like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to test my system and</font>

1092
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:57,529
you certify that it's good if it's a

1093
00:53:55,160 --> 00:54:01,190
mere hold harmless it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you</font>

1094
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:05,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">break it or I cause you damage no now</font>

1095
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:07,150
now you're standing in and saying yeah

1096
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:27,470
customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> sues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you you're defending me</font>

1097
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:30,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah right especially if it's not yet</font>

1098
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:33,379
done if you're like working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a project</font>

1099
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:36,200
that is not yet made it to github or

1100
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:37,670
isn't really there yet you would

1101
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:41,180
probably want to name it in your

1102
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:44,210
inventions disclosure because it's like

1103
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:46,370
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on yeah and come up that's</font>

1104
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:48,230
why I often tell my<font color="#CCCCCC"> mic lines</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like come</font>

1105
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:50,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">up with a name just name the thing so</font>

1106
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:52,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">that way instead of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a some really is</font>

1107
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:55,550
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> patent declaration like a thing</font>

1108
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:58,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">that does awesomeness wow that's useless</font>

1109
00:54:55,550 --> 00:55:01,130
know it's a library that does this thing

1110
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,560
and now it's a thing and you can

1111
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:06,830
basically claimed it as I'm walking into

1112
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:09,170
this place with this now in a lot of

1113
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:11,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">cases thinking about inventions if they</font>

1114
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:15,080
are close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> related to what you're</font>

1115
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:18,140
doing your day job you want to be

1116
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:20,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">careful lest you use you recycle code</font>

1117
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:24,080
one way or the other now it becomes

1118
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:26,240
where the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> can rightfully say</font>

1119
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:28,069
whoa wait a minute which in this code

1120
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:32,270
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> write for us which of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this code is</font>

1121
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:35,650
now in this open source project this

1122
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:39,130
smells like what we paid you to do

1123
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:39,130
that's a concern

1124
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:02,130
right

1125
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:25,480
yes so the difficulty now is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1126
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:28,670
protect how do you protect the project

1127
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:30,290
if these guys can come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say all</font>

1128
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:32,660
the code that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this person you're like</font>

1129
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:34,970
but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're like taking out like</font>

1130
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:38,149
individual lines like you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

1131
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:42,830
to two commits and going show me<font color="#CCCCCC"> show me</font>

1132
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:44,030
on this what's yours<font color="#CCCCCC"> i I'm less</font>

1133
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:46,250
concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for open source</font>

1134
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:47,540
because most of the time I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless</font>

1135
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:50,630
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source package becomes</font>

1136
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:52,490
incredibly valuable like in the linux

1137
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:53,930
kernel or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it odds</font>

1138
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:55,669
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be like yeah it's a</font>

1139
00:56:53,930 --> 00:57:06,200
wash we don't think there's anything of

1140
00:56:55,670 --> 00:57:08,120
enough value to fight you on it yeah

1141
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,890
it's one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those like i identified this</font>

1142
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:12,640
as a risk the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> i identified that</font>

1143
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:20,779
there is you know meteor or clown risk

1144
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:23,109
involved cool I think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done thank</font>

1145
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:23,110
you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>
