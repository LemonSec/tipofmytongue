before I begin let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> say a little bit</font>

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:39,140
about Who I am and why what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to</font>

what I do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security research and</font>

have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a blog at www news com let me tell</font>

00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,890
you a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit about how this talk</font>

started before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get into it this talk</font>

00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:30,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">is understanding why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security for</font>

27
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:33,320
non-experts and it started like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">and he's a cyber security researcher</font>

31
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,909
like me doesn't work the same company I

32
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,030
have no idea where in the world he is

33
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:49,100
but he had a list of cybersecurity

34
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,200
recommendations that made a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of sense</font>

35
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">to me I could relate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what he was</font>

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,040
saying he put it out there on the

37
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,010
internet and said I recommend you do

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,159
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and someone came back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

39
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">they said why can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you explain to us why</font>

40
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,880
you made the recommendations<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

41
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,140
did and said oh I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time for</font>

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know I'm too busy doing</font>

43
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,390
research just take what works for you

44
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,659
leave what<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't I said I'll take that</font>

45
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:17,059
I can answer why I'm happy to do that

46
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:19,480
I'm all about education so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it brings us</font>

47
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,830
to our brief today

48
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,380
understanding why<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity for</font>

49
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,240
non-experts now if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are any experts</font>

50
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,590
in the audience you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice that at</font>

51
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,160
certain points<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to kind of</font>

52
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,900
gloss over things this is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

53
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,700
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to get to in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the woods</font>

54
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,830
I don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get too deep into any</font>

55
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,780
one subject because I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

56
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,810
material to cover and it's a limited

57
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">amount of time so bear with me if you</font>

58
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:47,000
would for those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you who are not</font>

59
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:49,579
experts a lot of this information<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be</font>

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">new it may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not be new depending upon how</font>

61
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:56,170
much cyber security training you've had

62
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:59,870
up to this point let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me start here</font>

63
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:02,750
software is eating the world these are

64
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,640
the words of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Marc Andreessen among other</font>

65
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,490
things he's well known as being<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

66
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,130
co-author of the mosaic browser and the

67
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:12,650
co-founder of Netscape both of which

68
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:14,840
went on to<font color="#CCCCCC"> become the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> foundation for one</font>

69
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:18,980
of the most commonly<font color="#CCCCCC"> used browsers in</font>

70
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:21,410
the world the Firefox browser I believe

71
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,820
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> Andreessen made this quote software</font>

72
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,790
is eating the world what he meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

73
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:28,430
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the processes and machinations</font>

74
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:32,870
of our world are slowly being automated

75
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:36,790
and turned into software so how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

76
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,790
you would agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this statement I</font>

77
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,170
believe that software at this point is

78
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,810
ubiquitous and our life depends on it

79
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:48,100
it's in our cars and our automatic

80
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:51,260
teller machines in our power grids<font color="#CCCCCC"> so on</font>

81
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:54,910
at this point you've all seen or heard

82
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:57,798
of self parking cars self-driving cars

83
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,780
and my car the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one i drive to work in</font>

84
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,720
every day has for example 32 bit

85
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,810
processor it has transmission control

86
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,580
software written in<font color="#E5E5E5"> c and c++ the</font>

87
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:13,430
entertainment system runs on top of

88
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:15,470
linux see the central<font color="#CCCCCC"> processing unit</font>

89
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,720
the brain of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the computer if you will</font>

90
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,350
talks to the tires through bluetooth to

91
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,850
find out how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> pressure is in there</font>

92
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:26,120
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a regular car it's an ordinary</font>

93
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:28,340
car with stock hardware and software the

94
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">cpu also talks to the breaks over an</font>

95
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,229
internal network

96
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:35,149
so I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that my life depends on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

97
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:37,248
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there came a point where I</font>

98
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:39,710
needed to accelerate or stop in a hurry

99
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:41,149
and the software failed and prevented me

100
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:48,349
from doing that that could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

101
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:51,559
me the problem with software is that

102
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:53,930
it's hard to do right not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just get the</font>

103
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:56,779
basic functionality working but<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

104
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,399
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security aspects as well as a</font>

105
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:01,789
software engineer I've seen it happen

106
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:04,159
many times bill the banker goes and

107
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:06,498
talks to Danny developer and he says I

108
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:09,319
need some software that's going to count

109
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:11,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">one dollar bills so Danny gets to</font>

110
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:14,270
writing program writing the program

111
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:16,129
hashing it out and in the meantime bill

112
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,248
comes back to him<font color="#E5E5E5"> and says oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by the way</font>

113
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:21,319
it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to count five dollar bills</font>

114
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:23,719
so Danny goes and makes the changes he

115
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:25,610
writes the program he delivers it still

116
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:27,558
says yes this is great<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is exactly</font>

117
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,809
what I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I wanted but in the</font>

118
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:33,229
meantime things have changed now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need</font>

119
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:36,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">to count tens 20s hundreds and the</font>

120
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:38,508
equivalent in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Euros so Danny takes the</font>

121
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,769
program back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he's coding he's</font>

122
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:44,659
changing what he doesn't know is with

123
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:47,120
every change that he makes little bugs

124
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:49,519
creep into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by the time</font>

125
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,649
he delivers a working program it's going

126
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have a remote code execution bug</font>

127
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:55,729
that's going to allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> halle hacker to</font>

128
00:05:54,169 --> 00:06:00,378
connect into bills machine and take

129
00:05:55,729 --> 00:06:02,568
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it so why does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Holly want to</font>

130
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:04,729
make life harder for bill obviously

131
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:07,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">bills</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got money that's why he needs this</font>

132
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:10,339
dollar bill counting program he has

133
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:12,559
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Ali wants maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Holly</font>

134
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:14,449
once failed to think that he has more

135
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:16,969
money than he actually does so when he

136
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:20,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes to report it he'll over report and</font>

137
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:22,430
get himself in trouble maybe she wants

138
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,889
him to think he has less money than he

139
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:28,759
actually does so she can skim money off

140
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:31,369
the top and he won't notice clearly bill

141
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:36,199
has something that Holly wants is so

142
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:37,370
he's a target question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you also a</font>

143
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,770
target

144
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:44,180
do you have anything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hallie may be</font>

145
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:47,240
interested in maybe you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do some online</font>

146
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:50,060
banking through your telephone your

147
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,620
laptop or your desktop computer all of

148
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,630
which I'll refer to as your computer

149
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,449
from this point forward maybe you

150
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:58,669
control investment accounts maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

have pictures of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your family or a</font>

browser that's logged into<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook or</font>

153
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:07,880
maybe you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a car where the CPU talks</font>

154
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,490
to the tires over Bluetooth and it talks

155
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:16,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the breaks over internal network are</font>

156
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:17,870
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things important to halle let me</font>

157
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,960
tell you what's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hallie cares about</font>

158
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:24,199
you might be the target of an attack

159
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,150
because your<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU your central processing</font>

160
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,720
unit the brain of your computer has

161
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:33,380
value to Hallie even if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

162
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,120
access to money pictures<font color="#CCCCCC"> or music on</font>

163
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,060
your computer the fact that you have a

164
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,100
processor is valuable to her let's say

165
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,690
you don't have access to money from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

166
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,330
computer you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> control your accounts</font>

167
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:47,419
through your computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> your phone tally</font>

168
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:52,280
can generate electronic currency<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin</font>

169
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:54,590
on your computer bitcoin is electronic

170
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,500
currency it's not backed by any central

171
00:07:54,590 --> 00:08:00,080
bank and the value is determined by

172
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:03,590
supply and demand the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

173
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,539
generate bitcoin is through mining means

174
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,609
that means you have your computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

175
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:09,650
some certain mathematical calculations

176
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,720
and you submit that as proof<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

177
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,330
you get paid you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have electronic</font>

178
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,400
currency you can store on a hard drive

179
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:19,039
and normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> this isn't worthwhile to do</font>

180
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,198
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> people because it might take a</font>

181
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,780
hundred dollars worth of electricity to

182
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,610
generate twenty dollars worth of bitcoin

183
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,729
but if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is providing the</font>

184
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:31,400
hardware<font color="#CCCCCC"> and paying for the electricity</font>

185
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:33,348
suddenly becomes worthwhile of course

186
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,360
Hallie's not going to be satisfied just

187
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:37,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">attacking and controlling your computer</font>

00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:21,390
not on her computer but on yours using

203
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:24,460
technology called tor The Onion Router

204
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:26,710

difficult to navigate google bing yahoo

these services do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not enter tab index</font>

comfortable here and she may be inclined

out to legitimate business services like

realize that they could send out a bunch

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,420
of traffic shut down those service and

263
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,760
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called a denial of service if it</font>

multiple computers are attacking the

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:20,359
target and after doing this distributed

268
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,370
denial of service she will then send an

269
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,100
extortion note saying if you don't pay

270
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:27,010
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll shut down your surface again so</font>

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,709
this is distributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> denial-of-service</font>

272
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:32,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">extortion again Hal he's smart she</font>

273
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,670
realizes that if she does this from her

274
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,160
come

275
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">puters for friends computers one of them</font>

276
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,449
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go to jail maybe all of them</font>

277
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:43,500
so she'd much rather do this from your

278
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:44,910
computer this is why your internet

279
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,060
connection has value<font color="#CCCCCC"> to her and you</font>

280
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:49,560
might become<font color="#CCCCCC"> a target so here's how the</font>

281
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,719
attack would be carried out i'm going to

282
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,579
give you four scenarios it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not limited</font>

283
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">to these four but these are four common</font>

284
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:58,740
scenarios the first is called phishing

285
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,810
and it's just like real life fishing you

286
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,010
get some bait you Daniel it in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

287

the target you wait for them to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

288
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:06,150
bite so here's what how<font color="#CCCCCC"> they might do</font>

289
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,939
she might look you up on social<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks</font>

290
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:10,920
like Facebook she might discover that

291
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,800
you have a daughter who goes to college

292
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,810
in another city you might put together

293
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,670
some content to make it look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like your</font>

294
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,979
daughter has been kidnapped and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font>

295
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:22,110
to pay her in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your daughter</font>

296
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">back so she'll dangle this bait in front</font>

297
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,090
of you and wait for you to bite now this

298
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,640
attack might come to you via email it

299
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:33,000
might be SMS<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> message or even a</font>

300
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:35,460
phone call very recently think it was

301
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,620
the New York Times reported on just this

302
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,180
sort of virtual kidnapping where someone

303
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,980
had researched the target<font color="#E5E5E5"> they found out</font>

304
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,319
she had a daughter in another city<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

305
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,670
other states<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to college they made</font>

306
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they had kidnapped the</font>

307
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,849
daughter and they had the mother driving

308
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,700
all around town going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the local</font>

309
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:53,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">Walmart's sending money to them until at</font>

310
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,750
the end of the day the mother got an SMS

311
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,939
from her daughter<font color="#E5E5E5"> who actually hadn't</font>

312
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,230
been kidnapped and she went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

313
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">police after that and reported this</font>

314
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:03,240
don't think she ever got her money back

315
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:05,540
so that's one attack that's the phishing

316
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,540
attack

317
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:12,350
holly has<font color="#E5E5E5"> many other options to her</font>

318
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:14,870
among those the watering hole attack now

319
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:17,150
in the real world it works like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

320
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,800
lion will wait by the local watering

324
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,350
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> antelope so here's how this would</font>

325
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:32,630
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hallie has compromised the website</font>

326
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:37,040
and she's put some code on there perhaps

327
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:38,480
JavaScript<font color="#CCCCCC"> that she knows that when you</font>

328
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,040
come to her website you're going to be

329
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,860
redirected automatically in the

330
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,410
background to download some malware

331
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,910
you're going to take to take control<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

332
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,600
your computer and do all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> nasty</font>

333
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:52,280
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we already talked about now</font>

334
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,720
she discovers which websites you're

335
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,640
going to go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> because she's researched</font>

336
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,640
you she knows for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example ego all the</font>

337
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:01,040
time to cnn.com or facebook com google

338
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,930
com whatever the case may be she knows a

339
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,290
little bit about you and she has set

340
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:08,750
this up in advance now it takes a little

341
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,610
bit of effort to compromise a web server

342
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,890
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not impossible but it takes some</font>

343
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:16,430
effort if she's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling up to that</font>

344
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:20,120
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> option she has is Mel vertising</font>

345
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,979
that is sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> you an ad with some code</font>

346
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,080
inside that's going to manipulate your

347
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:28,700
computer into doing something you really

348
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:31,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't want it to do there are four</font>

349
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:34,610
publishers of goods and<font color="#CCCCCC"> services a bunch</font>

350
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,840
of legitimate advertising networks where

351
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,730
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make up a little commercial</font>

352
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:41,270
maybe it's an image maybe it's a video

353
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:43,670
maybe it's a flash object you send this

354
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:45,620
into the ad network and then publishers

355
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:48,260
who want to monetize their sites and

356
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,180
download your advertisement show it on

357
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,800
their website and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you pay them a cent</font>

358
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,800
five cents whatever the case may be

359
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,860
unfortunately some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

360
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:01,840
advertisements do have bad things in

361
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,430
them code that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to make your</font>

362
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,380
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> things do things you don't want</font>

363
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:08,380
it to do I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen this happen for</font>

364
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:12,010
example on forbes.com yahoo com and

365
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:15,189
google com among other sites in

366
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:19,090
particular a friend of mine online went

367
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:21,130
to forbes.com and he had an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad blocker</font>

368
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,650
extension in his web browser so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he</font>

369
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:25,450
wouldn't see any of these advertisements

370
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:28,000
when he got to the website forbes.com

371
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,740
said hey we noticed you're using an ad

372
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,630
blocker it's preventing us from

373
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,460
monetizing our site would you please

374
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:35,620
turn it off before you continue to read

375
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,360
our article he said okay that sounds

376
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">reasonable he turned off his ad blocker</font>

377
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,630
and he instantly download downloaded

378
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:45,790
malware he got malware on his<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer</font>

379
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:47,050
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> may wonder why would a publisher</font>

380
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,420
go along with this why would they be

381
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:51,490
complicit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the fact is they have</font>

382
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:54,370
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's in the content of these</font>

383
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:57,160
ads for all they know they're simply

384
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:59,830
demonstrating a good or product<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

385
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,110
may actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> want their options are</font>

386
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:05,110
either show advertisements from

387
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:06,910
legitimate ad networks or don't put

388
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:09,550
another way they can either monetize

389
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:11,590
their site or don't they have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

390
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,599
what the content of these ads are they

391
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:15,780
just show them<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're a vector if you</font>

392
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,780
will

393
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:23,418
and finally even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you don't use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> social</font>

394
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:25,279
networks you don't access money from

395
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:28,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">your computer and you're blocking acts</font>

396
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:31,639
you're not out of the woods yet if you

397
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:34,759
have any software or devices that access

398
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:36,979
the internet they may provide an avenue

399
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:39,340
to attack they may make you vulnerable

400
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:44,659
because again they're using software and

401
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:47,539
software is hard to do right publishers

402
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:49,549
and developers don't have an infinite

403
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:51,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of time and money in spite of</font>

404

their best intentions to test their

405
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:55,100
products against all possible inputs so

406
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:58,190
a lot of times software is going to have

407
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,590

to see software services online that

take either default credentials like

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> easiest thing that you can do is</font>

433
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:11,320
simply update your operating system when

finally if your operating system offers

460

it I recommend that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use full disk</font>

462
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,490
is where I'm going to start to gloss

463
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,320
over things if it's available for your

464
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,090
operating system and if it's implemented

465
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,000
correctly will prevent people from

accessing your content on the computer

467
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,230

even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they have the highest level of</font>

down your browser and finally my

519
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,320
recomendation to anyone is use a

only two options either iOS that is

537
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,510
Apple devices or Android I understand

538
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there is such a thing as Windows</font>

certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of software that's</font>

the phone is supposed to be it's

supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect their intellectual</font>

551
00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:02,840
property and it has the secondary effect

552
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:03,949
of also protecting the end user so again

553
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,889
you want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have the</font>

554
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:10,610
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> up-to-date version of iOS or</font>

555
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:15,800
Android if you're using Android prefer

556
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:18,229
Nexus to other devices because Nexus

557
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,480
gets updates from google immediately as

558
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:23,780
they're available if you have another

559
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,870
phone you will get updates when and if

560
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:29,990
the verizons and the ATM to use of the

561

world decide to send you updates maybe

562
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:36,350
never the most secure device if you

563
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:39,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">decide to go this route is one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> without a</font>

564
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:41,510
subscriber identity module now the sim

565

card has its own hardware and software

566
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,320
that enables you to connect into

567
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,180
cellular networks you won't be able to

568
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:52,310
connect at the cellular networks if you

569
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:54,230
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> one but that creates greater</font>

attack surface for you to be attack it

571
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:59,780
makes you more vulnerable so the best

572
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:01,520
configuration is perhaps an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipad or an</font>

ipod touch that doesn't have a sim card

616
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:03,500
version is this when the situation is

617
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:05,720
out of your control that's out of your

618
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,580
control you have to deviate when you

619
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,870
have other defenses in place perhaps

620
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,090
some other protections that I didn't

00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,260
mention during this<font color="#E5E5E5"> video that may be</font>

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay to deviate from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:17,150
recommendations<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when the benefit</font>

624
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:18,830
outweighs the risk it may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay say</font>

625
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:21,290
for example you create a virtual machine

626
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:23,210
and you go and you test out something

627
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:25,190
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you decide to destroy the</font>

virtual machine there's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

risk there the slightly longer version

630
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:34,730
is this use operational risk management

631
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:36,290
figure out what is the danger here

632
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:38,230
what's the likelihood<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that happening</font>

633
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:40,240
what damage is going to happen

634
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:41,890
and what benefits can i accrue by doing

635
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,169
this and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it seems like it's a</font>

a researcher at Microsoft likes to put

this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> into perspective as follows</font>

it's the Mossad or not Mossad problem

Mossad or not Mossad if you're being

650
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:23,710
attacked by not Mossad there are many

651
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">things you can do to protect yourself</font>

652
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:28,000
maybe even stop them in their tracks

653
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,620
completely among those are the things

<font color="#E5E5E5">that I've already talked about in</font>

00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:42,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">my recommendation I recommend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that</font>

659
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,260
on your computer you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one account</font>

660
00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:46,570
that has administrative privileges that

661
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,250
you use to install software and a

662
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:53,020
separate non-privileged account that

663
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:55,059
you'll use if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> being attacked by</font>

664
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,500
Mossad they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

665
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:58,809
computer there's nothing that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do</font>

666
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,549
they might use a custom exploit that

667
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:03,428
they spend millions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars to</font>

668
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:04,960
develop or they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use a crowbar</font>

669
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:06,970
and they'll hit you in the head until

670
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,610
you open up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the computer for them either</font>

671
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:12,160
way they're getting into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your computer</font>

672
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:14,260
so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you deviate honestly you</font>

673
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,330
know your situation better use

674
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,610
operational risk management to the

675
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:20,939
benefits outweigh the risks and then go

676
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,939
for it

677
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,210
so how do you deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a successful</font>

00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:28,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">attack what do you do when you've been</font>

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:30,160

you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an account and then</font>

722
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,630
and he said I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could use it but I didn't</font>

723
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,130
quite feel comfortable putting it into

724
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:16,810
the presentation but<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's the</font>

information first he says don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> panic in</font>

729
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:29,470

730
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,940
I realize that I'm being attacked my

731
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,710
first response is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to shut down</font>

732
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:34,990
the computer and stop as a fact you

733
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,170
don't want to do that because you're

734
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font>

735

to be destroying volatile evidence of

00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:42,700
the attack resist the urge third

737

disconnect from all networks at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

networks that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're connected to so</font>

741
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:54,010
disconnect from all networks fourth stop

742
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:59,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">touching the computer and take a deep</font>

743
00:31:54,010 --> 00:32:01,480
breath at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point if you're touching</font>

around in a crime scene you think you

746
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,120
may be messing up evidence so you need

747
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,780
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> resist the urge touch the computer</font>

748
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,610
anymore stop then write<font color="#CCCCCC"> down all the</font>

749
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:16,629
details you can remember about the

750
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:17,919
attack finally call for<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you want to</font>

751
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,930
call someone who's got some cyber

752
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,570
security or cyber forensic experience

753
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:24,310
and preferably you want to know who

754
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,260
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get</font>

755
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:28,629
hacked the last thing you want to do

756
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:32,160
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get hacked is spend a bunch of</font>

757
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,160
time trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out who to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call if</font>

758
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:38,380
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a compromised IOT device the</font>

759
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,750
way that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to handle that is</font>

760
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,490
going to going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to depend on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of</font>

762
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:48,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">give you two examples</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real-world</font>

763
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:51,400
examples earlier this year there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

764
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:53,740
young<font color="#CCCCCC"> lady who was involved in something</font>

765
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:58,450
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> police came and they seized her</font>

766
00:32:53,740 --> 00:33:02,320
iPhone as evidence as it turns out this

767
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:04,300
iphone was connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a baby monitor</font>

768
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,500
that had a camera and every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

769
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">camera would turn on there would be a</font>

770
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:10,660
little light that would indicate the

771
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:12,070
camera was on now after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the iphone was</font>

772
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,680
seized as evidence and taken back to

773
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:16,450
police headquarters the woman noticed

774
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,400
that the camera light was coming on at

775
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,990
seemingly at all hours of the day but

776
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:23,310
particularly when she was breastfeeding

777
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:25,840
her baby she eventually put together

778
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:27,730
that you know the camera was coming on

779
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,620
because it was connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the iDevice</font>

780
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:31,870
and someone had taken it out of evidence

781
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:34,330
and was using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so it came to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> light</font>

782
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:35,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">eventually that a policeman had taken it</font>

783
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:38,550
out of evidence that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was watching her</font>

784
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:40,320
from his home at breast feeding time

785
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:42,300
she was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put this together</font>

786
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,070
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> she recognized what was normal</font>

787
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:47,220
behavior and what was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not normal</font>

788
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:49,169
behavior for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> device so that's my</font>

789
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,580
advice to you is understand what's

790
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:53,100
normal behavior for your device and

791
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:57,300
what's not and then take steps when when

792
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:59,370
things get weird second story is sort of

793
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:02,760
electronic locks a gentleman I follow on

794
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:04,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter I'll call him Bob went out and</font>

795
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,070
bought electronic locks for his front

796
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:10,380
door now these electronic locks rely on

797
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:12,929
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> iDevice to work so he put an ipod</font>

798
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:14,670
touch or<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was an ipad actually</font>

799
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:16,770
in his living room so that the

800
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:18,179
electronic flux would work he was so

801
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:20,280
excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this about never being</font>

802
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,139
locked outside about being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to open</font>

803
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,970
his front door from his phone that he

804
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:25,560
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> and showed his neighbor his</font>

805
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:27,419
neighbor came<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at it said yeah</font>

806
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,739
this is the coolest thing since sliced

807
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:32,900
bread I'm probably going to get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

808
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:35,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing couple days passed and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bob is</font>

809
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:37,950
getting ready to go to work he's pulling

810
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:40,139
out of his his parking spot and his

811
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:41,969
neighbor same neighbor Tom comes over

812
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:44,370
and says hey hey before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off to</font>

813
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:46,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">work can I borrow some sugar about says</font>

814
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:47,639
sure yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> just let me parked car I'll go</font>

815
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,429
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for you Thompson so don't worry</font>

816
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:53,159
about it I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> let myself in he walks up</font>

817
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:57,150
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front door and he says hey Siri</font>

818
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:59,580
open the front door the I device I think

819
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:01,800
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iPad actually sent a signal to</font>

820
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:05,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">the electronic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lock opening the front</font>

821
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:07,260
door for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tom bob was mortified he called</font>

822
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:10,170
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> sick and he went he returned that</font>

823
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:12,780
electronic lock the same day so the

824
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:15,510
message here is security<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not always</font>

825
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:18,990
baked into the IOT devices that you're

826
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:21,090
using so understand again what's

827
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:23,220
normally what's normal behavior what's

828
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:24,900
not normal behavior and then know what

829
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,209
steps to take when you realize that

830
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:29,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">things are not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way you expected them</font>

831
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be</font>

832
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:38,460
got all the way through without<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

833
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:41,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> water I really needed at this one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

834
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:43,960
so in conclusion let me sum up what

835
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:47,230
we've talked about first realize that

836
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,970
you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a target if you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a CPU</font>

837
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:51,070
you've got storage you've got a network

838
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:55,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">connection then you are a valuable</font>

839
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:57,640
target for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Halle hacker even if you're</font>

840
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,700
not the ultimate target how i can use

841
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:04,210
what you have to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> what she wants to</font>

842
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:06,399
protect yourself second realize that you

843
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:08,470
are vulnerable<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if you don't do</font>

844
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,619
online banking you don't use social

845
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:13,540
networks if you have any hardware or

846
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:15,339
software that talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the internet you</font>

847
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:18,550
may potentially be vulnerable because

848
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:19,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">software is hard to do right follow the</font>

849
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:21,880
software<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the devices</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font>

850
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:23,529
using using<font color="#E5E5E5"> google alerts and when it</font>

851
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:27,130
turns out that it's vulnerable you'll be

852
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:29,680
the first to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know protect yourself</font>

853
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:33,130
regularly update your software if that's

854
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,230
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and disable any unused code</font>

855
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:37,930
that you don't need turn off office

856
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:40,839
macros if you don't use them remove the

857
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:43,180
Python interpreter if you don't use that

858
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:45,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so on anything that you don't need</font>

859
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,440
get it off your computer because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's</font>

860
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,790

convenience to someone who's trying to

00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:55,270
get onto your computer recognize bad

behavior know your software know your

IOT devices understand what's normal

865
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:03,010
behavior what's not and know who to<font color="#CCCCCC"> call</font>

866
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:05,500
when things get weird share what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

867
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:07,630
know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not everything that you</font>

868
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:10,210
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security but</font>

869
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:12,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">knowing what you know now will make you</font>

870
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:14,980
a harder target than most of the people

871
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:17,290
in the world if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> share what you know</font>

872
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,420
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> family friends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and co-workers</font>

873
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:21,550
you could help<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to protect</font>

874
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:25,589
themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> online and we'll all be</font>

875
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:25,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">better off for it especially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Brian Krebs</font>

876
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:31,270
finally understand that security is not

877
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:32,770
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> end state it's something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to aspire to</font>

878
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,690
you're never going to get there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

879
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:36,420
have to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

880
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:38,790
or toward it at this point hopefully

881
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,340
with the knowledge that you have you're

882
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,810
able to recognize when<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks are</font>

883
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,380
happening and deal with them in a way

884
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:48,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will preserve evidence and</font>

885
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:50,850
hopefully stop the attack in its tracks

886
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:55,890
now what were those steps to handling an

887
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:59,160
attack again one don't panic<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 don't</font>

888
00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:03,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn off the computer three disconnect</font>

889
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:08,310
from all networks or stop touching the

890
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:09,600
computer take a deep breath<font color="#E5E5E5"> by write</font>

891
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:12,860
down all the details you can remember

892
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:16,350
about the attack and six call for help

893
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:18,540
at this point you understand why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

might<font color="#E5E5E5"> become the attack of the victim of</font>

897
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:31,320
some cybersecurity practices to protect

898
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:33,000
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and why they work and at this</font>

899
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:37,890
point you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have enough information</font>

900
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:41,310
to handle an attack and<font color="#E5E5E5"> publish much</font>
