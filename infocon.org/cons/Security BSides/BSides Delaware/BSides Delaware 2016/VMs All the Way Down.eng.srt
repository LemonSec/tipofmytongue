00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,719
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the question then becomes well</font>

15
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,280
what's the turtle standing on another

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,950
turtle which leads to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conclusion</font>

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,620
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Turtles all the way down so</font>

18
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,240
when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to virtualization you can</font>

19
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,400
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of get this feeling a little bit of</font>

00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,080
things get very meta kind of inception

26
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,940
that will help you take your

virtualization and therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> InfoSec</font>

skills to the next level first of all

operations but most importantly for this

38
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,140
talk I'm a guy who set up a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of labs</font>

39
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,210
recently I've kind of gone crazy

40
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,890
collecting stuff at my house and tried a

41
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,419
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff so I thought I would impart</font>

42
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,780
some of knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I gained from</font>

43
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,280
doing that with the community here

44
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,840
there's my Twitter of my blog post<font color="#E5E5E5"> or my</font>

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,470
blog entry which the slides will be

46
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,450
posted at afterwards so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick run down</font>

47
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,770
at the topics here first why the

48
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,270
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of virtualization</font>

49
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,820
there's going to be easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> type 1 and</font>

50
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:53,350
type 2 a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you have probably tried</font>

51
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,908
type to you before but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to go</font>

52
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,699
a little more into type 1 which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

53
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:59,710
more professional business use type

54
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,150
virtualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> with esxi and things like</font>

55
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,100
that that people may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have not tried on</font>

56
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,049
their own at home<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also going to</font>

57
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,929
suggest some hardware that I like for

58
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:09,549
running these virtualization labs some

59
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,739
software that I like running them with

60
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:13,390
hypervisor wise as well as the software

61
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:15,340
to run with them so that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be your</font>

62
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,980
virtual machines that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> suggest as well</font>

63
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,269
as a hardware networking gear and then

64
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,769
the setups for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network for those</font>

65
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:22,780
things

66
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,670
so first of all is why do you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

67
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,020
this obviously we're all here to learn

68
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,030
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're going to do with</font>

69
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,800
your lab now many of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may have set up</font>

70
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,180
individual virtual machines before and

71
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">tried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> either breaking into them</font>

72
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,140
defending them whatever it may be but in

73
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,579
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case we're going to take it a step</font>

74
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,399
further than that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to set</font>

75
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,020
up a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire company style network</font>

76
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,820
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have different zones and</font>

77
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,530
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> much different virtual</font>

78
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,019
machines and network infrastructure here

79
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,400
to really take it to the next level you

80
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,170
can practice attack that way you can

81
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,120
practice the fence you can do both at

82
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,290
once and what you do that you're also

83
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,630
going to learn things like system

84
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,000
administration networking and secure

85
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,829
design like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the goal being</font>

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,710
emulated company infrastructure all

87
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,270
inside one computer so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where</font>

88
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,950
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> past</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

89
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,480
sure you've all seen labs that look like

90
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,890
this they sit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your basement you don't</font>

91
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,340
need to use your furnace anymore because

92
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,929
it creates so much heat I don't know if

93
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,760
it saves on heating bills or not but

94
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,380
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it more so</font>

95
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,000
like the picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right which if</font>

96
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,720
you can tell has a picture of itself in

97
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">the picture access point a switch and a</font>

98
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,310
computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is mainly where I'm trying to</font>

99
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,579
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> here it so this is affordable and</font>

100
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,959
physically easy cheap and efficient and

101
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,670
this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a summary where we're going</font>

102
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,750
but just so you know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

103
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,130
thing we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about here can</font>

104
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,209
be exploded into a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> that looks</font>

105
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,480
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this with multiple different</font>

106
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,530
switches lots of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMs firewalls</font>

107
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,350
monitoring infrastructure and all this

108
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,820
kind of stuff which will go into but

109
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,709
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go into this please consider</font>

110
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,540
your goals there's a lot of ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

111
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:51,820
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> accomplish this there's going to</font>

112
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,040
be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tack centric setups defense set</font>

113
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,140
drink or secure architecture whatever

114
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,549
you're focusing on also<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider if</font>

115
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,929
there's a particular package that you

116
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,410
use at work you might want to lean

117
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:04,060
toward<font color="#E5E5E5"> using that for your home lab also</font>

118
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,740
if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to take this on</font>

119
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,020
the road or if this going this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

120
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to sit at home on your network that's</font>

121
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,110
another consideration that's going to

122
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,150
drive all these requirements that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

123
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,830
come up with as well as whether you're

124
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,010
willing to put this in line with your

125
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:21,250
home network or not also power noise

126
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,840
obviously a concern for<font color="#CCCCCC"> most of us so</font>

127
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:26,590
the focus of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this talk what I'm going to</font>

128
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,900
try to hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> on is optimizing the the</font>

129
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,810
virtualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup minimizing software</font>

130
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:34,179
expense hardware expense and power used

131
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,740
and maximize the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flexibility</font>

132
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,509
and what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would call significant other</font>

133
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,690
acceptance factor because that's

134
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:42,550
important probably to a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us so how</font>

135
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,560
are we<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font>

136
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">take software that is free open source</font>

137
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,400
and utilize that as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible</font>

138
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,409
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of really great solutions</font>

139
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,729
for that out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there where there isn't an</font>

140
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,560
available solution for that we're

141
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:55,449

143
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:59,350
will offer to people that want to play

146
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,840
say oh I already know this package let's

going to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> us out and where that</font>

149
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,190
isn't an option we're going to have free

150
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:11,020
trials that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

151
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,180
leverage intelligently and hopefully

154
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,690
we're going to virtualize everything as

155
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:21,250
much as we can we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to virtualize</font>

156
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,500
our endpoints our network infrastructure

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,789
and our<font color="#E5E5E5"> security and monitoring</font>

158
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,910
infrastructure and we're going to

159
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:29,680
minimize our<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware purchase we don't</font>

160
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,910
want anything to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a single job I don't</font>

161
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,669
know if anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> here watches good eats</font>

162
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,620
but Alton Brown refers to his rule of

163
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:37,719
the kitchen which is no unit<font color="#E5E5E5"> asker's and</font>

164
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,760
so we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow that rule with</font>

165
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,349
network hardware and with our computers

166
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,240
we don't want a computer to be a single

167
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:44,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer ever we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be multiple</font>

168
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,870
computers we want switches to be

169
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,639
multiple switches we want Wi-Fi access

170
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,470
points to act like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're multiple</font>

171
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,270
Wi-Fi access points so we're going to

172
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,909
leverage all of this together in one and

173
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,740
try to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very very flexible setup</font>

174
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:59,500
they can do almost anything you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want for</font>

175
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,970
as cheap as possible the first thing you

176
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,380
need to know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is hypervisors which</font>

177
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,229
is fancy term for what's running your

178
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,820
virtual machines there are two types<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

179
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:09,219
them you're probably familiar with type

00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">2 this is the hosted version and this is</font>

181
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:14,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that you see like VMware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

182
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:16,750
virtualbox you have your hardware and

183
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,190
then your operating system and that's

184
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,750
running a hypervisor<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's your</font>

00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,610
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMware in your virtual box running</font>

another set of operating systems above

187
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,860
that conceptually then you have the type

188
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:30,130
1 which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bare metal native</font>

190
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,789
directly and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one layer in</font>

191
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,590
between here and now there is a

192
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:37,240
theoretical<font color="#E5E5E5"> technical difference maybe</font>

193
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,960
in the past and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's so important now</font>

194
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,979
on how these leverage the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU built in</font>

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hardware registers to create</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">virtualization that's not really</font>

197
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,840
important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us whether it is or is not</font>

198
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,400
technically type 1

199
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,469
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is important to us is how</font>

200
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,388
we're using this lab and mainly it's

201
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,949
going to come down to is if you're using

202
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:55,570
the computer like a normal computer

203
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:57,370
you're going to need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type 1 if</font>

204
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:59,500
this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a separate computer</font>

205
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,300
and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to leave it in place or</font>

206
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,889
carry it additionally with you that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

207
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a type</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 because that is not</font>

208
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:07,960
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can use like a normal</font>

209
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:09,099
computer otherwise so your type 2

210
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,560
options this is just a quick summary

211
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,610
we're going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into detail here but</font>

212
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,699
mainly that's going to be VMware

213
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:19,780
Workstation not player I'll cover that

214
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:21,910
Oracle VirtualBox qmu and kvm is the

215
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,130
Linux free option and there's also

216
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:28,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">Microsoft Windows client hyper-v and</font>

217
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:30,250
there's parallels for mac OS first of

218
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,229
all workstation this is probably the one

219
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,570
we've all heard of there is vmware

220
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:36,669
player and which is vmware is free

221
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,560
option but you cannot use that because

222
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:40,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">it does not allow snapshots and you</font>

223
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,919
cannot run more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than one virtual machine</font>

224
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:45,130
at once so this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be out</font>

225
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,169
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> but workstation and fusion</font>

226
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,880
if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mac is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing it's</font>

227
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:52,359
a great great<font color="#E5E5E5"> option I call this the</font>

228
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">industry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> standard because when you get a</font>

229
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,200
lot of VMs pre-built virtual machines

230
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,740
for security or whatever it may be

231
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,030
they'll often come in VMware format so

232
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,470
that's one big benefit of doing this

233
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,299
workstation costs about two hundred

234
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,099
fifty dollars with a hundred dollar

235
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,810
upgrade<font color="#CCCCCC"> infusion is eighty dollars with</font>

236
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:09,340
fifty dollar upgrades so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

237
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,660
bit on the expensive side but it's the

238
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,419
premium product when it comes to

239
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:16,330
virtualization the other big win about

240
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:17,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is if you run two labs there are</font>

241
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,229
two physical machines at once one

242
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,630
running esxi and one running workstation

243
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:25,960
you can use the virtual machines on the

244
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:28,270
esxi box from your vmware workstation on

245
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,888
your computer as if they were local so

246
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,020
there's some wins to be had there for

247
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:33,700
using both of those things overall<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

248
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">would recommend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this if you're willing</font>

249
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,050
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it if you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

250
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,219
local and remote virtual machines or if

251
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:40,750
you want to ensure you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the best</font>

252
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,370
compatibility because it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

253
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,070
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that people always go to when</font>

254
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,180
they need a format now if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

255
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,790
to the other side of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> spectrum</font>

256
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,849
there's virtual box this is totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font>

257
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:53,410
it comes cross-platform and it is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

258
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">would call the other standard because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

259
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,949
lot of times you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can also download</font>

260
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,439
things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this format these are the two</font>

261
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,120
that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the most compatible</font>

262
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,680
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of a difference if if</font>

263
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,900
hardware is required hardware

264
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,229
virtualization is not required for

265
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,670
32-bit virtualization in<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMware so if</font>

266
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,250
you have some really old hardware you

267
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,209
might want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this because</font>

268
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,880
workstation is probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

269
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:18,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">compatible with that some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

270
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,290
interesting features in this are you can

271
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,699
run this headless and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pretend</font>

272
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,439
like it's a type<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and have it</font>

273
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,450
remotely on your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and connect to</font>

274
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,770
it with rdp to your virtual machines

275
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,050
that's an interesting option that none

276
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:31,329
of the other ones offer overall<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

277
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:33,969
recommend this as something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try first</font>

278
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make sure it works because if it</font>

279
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,880
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if it does it's free and</font>

280
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,400
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great it's going to be free</font>

281
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,540
forever so give it a shot as a first try

282
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,740
there's some other type<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> options</font>

283
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,930
you've probably heard of but these are

284
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:49,630
less common so windows client hyper-v

285
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:51,969
this is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quality product it</font>

286
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,700
comes free with windows 8 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> above if</font>

287
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,590
you have the professional<font color="#CCCCCC"> version it</font>

288
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,050
does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> come with the home version of</font>

289
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:01,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">Windows but it works great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it integrates</font>

290
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,770
with the Microsoft's type<font color="#CCCCCC"> one solution</font>

291
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:05,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is hyper-v server which we'll</font>

292
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,819
cover in a minute so if you want those

293
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,460
features maybe consider the windows one

294
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:12,160
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see as many virtual machines</font>

295
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:15,280
packaged in this format so you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

296
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,319
an issue there q mu and kvm is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux</font>

297
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,270
solution kvm stands for Colonel

298
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">virtualization module and that is the</font>

299
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:24,130
actual kernel module and Linux that does

300
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:26,350
the hardware virtualization with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU</font>

301
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,689
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Q mu is that think pretending to be</font>

302
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:31,450
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer components so those three</font>

303
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:33,100
things work together the main thing I

304
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,930
would say about this is that it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

305
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">come with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the GUI</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of bare</font>

306
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:40,209
bones if you want to add a GUI to it and

307
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:42,130
make it act like VirtualBox verte

308
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,980
manager is one of the standard options

309
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:46,750
for that you can run different

310
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,310
architectures on this that's one of the

311
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,350
other key points if you want to run a

312
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:54,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">Raspberry Pi virtually you can do it</font>

313
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,540
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Q mu and kvm so that's one thing</font>

314
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,360
that if you have a side case like that

315
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,040
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might want to consider this solution</font>

316
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,200
parallels is another one it's mac only

317
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,640
it works fine if you have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> already go</font>

318
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">ahead and use it but if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

319
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,660
to something to buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> costs the same as</font>

320
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:08,650
a workstation so I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend it</font>

321
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,250
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be as</font>

322
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:13,650
compatible with everything else

323
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,940
for type 1 here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that we're</font>

324
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:17,670
here to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about mainly this is going</font>

325
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,200
to be esxi AKA vsphere hypervisor<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

326
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,120
think they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of added that name</font>

327
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,570
on the last version there's also

328
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">xenserver this is free proxmox is a</font>

329
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,890
debian based linux that is a type<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

330
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:34,200
hypervisor and then hyper-v server from

00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:36,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft vsphere hypervisor AKA esxi is</font>

332
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,360
a industry standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would say and that</font>

333
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,650
many many businesses use it this is

334
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">something you're very likely to see at</font>

335
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:47,100
work and in professional virtualization

336
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:49,140
situations the downside here is that

337
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,550
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very picky about its hardware you</font>

338
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,350
can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> fill this on any machine and</font>

339
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,329
have it work you can check if it's

340
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,130
likely to work there's a hardware

341
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:59,940
compatibility list if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just Google</font>

342
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:02,010
esxi HCL that you can check if your

343

computer is going to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it but</font>

344
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,460
since this is geared to run on

345
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,599
professional level hardware mostly

346
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,100
that's the stuff that's going to be in

347
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,530
there your dell desktop is not going to

348
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,030
be on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that list that being said there's</font>

349
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,890
still a very good chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can</font>

350
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:16,199
run it on that but you may need to add

351
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">some drivers into the iso before you try</font>

352
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,770
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> install it because if it doesn't</font>

353
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:22,290
recognize your network card it won't let

354
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:24,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> install it so you can slip stream</font>

355
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:26,969
drivers in and still get it to work on

356
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:28,380
some desktops free version has some

357
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,640
feature restrictions but they shouldn't

358
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,400
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you unless you have a really</font>

359
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,010
crazy setup it's like 96 gigs of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ram or</font>

360
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,600
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> four physical processors so I</font>

361
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:39,060
wouldn't worry too much about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

362
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,130
would recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try this first as a</font>

363
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:44,270
type one solution because it's very

364
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:47,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">user-friendly and if it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> works it's great</font>

365
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:49,650
it's a very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good experience in</font>

366
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,480
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of type 1 hypervisors the other</font>

367
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:53,040
downside that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mention is they</font>

368
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,270
used to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows thick client you</font>

369
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,099
had to manage it with but it's actually

370
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,470
transitioning to a web front-end now

371
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:02,490
it's not perfect but it's plenty good to

372
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:04,080
use so be aware of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that proxmox ve this</font>

373
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,490
is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people probably haven't</font>

374
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,160
heard of if you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked into this</font>

375
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:10,560
this is basically debian linux with kvm

376
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,750
and a web front-end to direct all the

377
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,849
virtual machines being run this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going</font>

378
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,170
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> compatible with anything that's</font>

379
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,880
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run linux so that's going to be</font>

380
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,699
almost every computer you're going to be

381
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run this on it has a very nice</font>

382
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,760
web<font color="#E5E5E5"> front-end people use this for</font>

383
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,550
production situations this isn't like

384
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,580
test

385
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,920
software it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> high quality I would</font>

386
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,230
recommend<font color="#CCCCCC"> this as maybe the VirtualBox</font>

387
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,089
solution of type 1 hypervisors then you

388
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,529
can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it like that so if you want</font>

389
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:38,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's totally open and free</font>

390
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:40,810
you have hardware issues you may need to

391
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,729
use the CLI and Google a little bit the

392
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,410
documentation isn't as great but it is

393
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:47,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things are constantly changing</font>

394
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:49,240
they have a wiki on their site they sell

395
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,920
paid support so that might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be some of</font>

396
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,360
the reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't have perfect</font>

397
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,740
documentation out there is because

398
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,810
they're selling that to support the

399
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,430
development but other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that this is</font>

400
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,939
what I use at home I think it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> great</font>

401
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:02,949
solution and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

402
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,290
a Windows PC to manage your type 1

403
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,700
hypervisor you're going to need that

404
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">xenserver this is the other option this</font>

405
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,450
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sits between the two this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

406
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:13,140
professional level quality a lot of big

407
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:15,459
corporations use this AWS runs on it

408
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:18,240
Rackspace runs on it lino to all those

409
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:20,229
things so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is great quality</font>

410
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,769
unfortunately it's also picky about the

411
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,450
hardware this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> totally free whereas</font>

412
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:27,550
with ESX they're giving you a free

413
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,410
version that you have to still<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

414
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,890
registration key for they just give<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

415
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,719
to you free and the downside here is

416
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,270
that it's managed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> zen center which is</font>

417
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">a windows only client so if you don't</font>

418
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:41,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">have windows there are some third-party</font>

419
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,550
solutions people have cooked up but I've

420
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">not tried them to know if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're going</font>

421
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:48,609
to work or not so something to think

422
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:51,130
about hyper-v server you might use this

423
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,300
at work it's free you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> install it it</font>

424
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,040
is windows server but if you're just

425
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing the hyper-v role it can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be done</font>

426
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,719
free I tried to install this and play

427
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:59,500
with it it was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> frustrating it wants</font>

428
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be on the Active Directory</font>

429
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,829
environment if you're running a hectic

430
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,920
directories at home which<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

431
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:07,660
be doing after this talk you can run

432
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,910
this and get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> done easily but if you</font>

433
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,819
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to run hyper-v server on its</font>

434
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:14,740
own it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to have a bunch</font>

435
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:17,199
of exceptions made for trusts and things

436
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,180
like that to control it but if you're

437
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,029
running client hyper-v the interaction

438
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,920
is very nice like workstation with esxi

439
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:25,870
you can control those remote machines

440
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,579
and have a local console for that so

441
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,199
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very convenient if you have a good</font>

442
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:33,040
reason to use it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise I</font>

443
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:35,260
wouldn't recommend it so between<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

444
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,880
two when you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decide what should</font>

445
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,850
you think about do you have an extra

446
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,410
computer is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

447
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,819
the main one if you don't have an extra

448
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,589
computer you're probably going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

449
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:45,139
stuck with pipe too because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't</font>

450
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:47,149
run type 1 eyes a primary operating

451
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:49,940
system on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you carry it</font>

452
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:51,670
around and use every day also consider

453
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,959
whether your hardware is compatible

454
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:55,790
consider whether the networking gear you

455
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:58,579
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to go with this at</font>

456
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,439
home is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be allowing what you</font>

457
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:03,079
want to do with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen which will</font>

458
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,089
go into in a second what<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMs are you</font>

459
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:07,670
running you're running anything arm MIPS

460
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:10,130
any of the alternative processes that

461
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:12,259
might be running is going to require qmu

462
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,899
and then how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to manage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

463
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:16,459
windows family if you're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows</font>

464
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:18,050
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all the options you want if</font>

465
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:19,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're not running windows maybe proxmox</font>

466
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,399
is your better option and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then of course</font>

467
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:24,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost so my overall recommendation here</font>

468
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,060
is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the money and you have</font>

469
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:29,329
the hardware that's compatible go with

470
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,130
virtual vmware workstation and ESX all

471
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:33,680
around if you want to go totally free

472
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:36,790
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source go with virtualbox and</font>

473
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,319
proxmox both of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are great options</font>

474
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,209
what if you want to try them and you're

475
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:43,550
not really sure what you want this is

476
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:46,849
where things get a little weird you can

477
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:49,729
run type to virtualization running a

478
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:53,540
type<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 hypervisor so you can install</font>

479
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:56,300
esxi proxmox and then on vmware

480
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:59,420
workstation and then install<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMs in that</font>

481
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:01,699
so yes this is where your mind starts

482
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,769
exploding and things get very hard to

483
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:05,119
keep track of but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

484
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:06,730
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> highly recommend you try this if</font>

485
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,688
you've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> done this before because</font>

486
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,069
not only will you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to play with the</font>

487
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:11,209
interfaces and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you</font>

488
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:13,039
actually like how you're going to

489
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:16,220
control all this but when you're done

490
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can take your VMS VMS and move them</font>

491
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,120
out one level when you install<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on</font>

492
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:21,679
your real hardware and just move them

493
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:24,079
over to the actual hardware when you

494
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,760
install<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so you won't necessarily be</font>

495
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,559
wasting too much time doing that if you

496
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,940
can set<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up now the downside is you're</font>

497
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:30,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to need a lot of RAM because</font>

498
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,450
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be cutting off a big</font>

499
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:34,129
chunk to run the type 1 hypervisor<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

500
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:37,299
then all of it inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

501
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:41,210
be used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bm's you installed so</font>

502
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:43,730
it's possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wanted to note that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

503
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:46,280
so hardware what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

504
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,049
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to need most importantly a</font>

505
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,580
lot of RAM that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be the thing</font>

506
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:50,620
that you're almost for sure going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run</font>

507
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,379
out at first so

508
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,659
trying to decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> where to spend money</font>

509
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,680
spend it on<font color="#CCCCCC"> ram the second thing that</font>

510
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,740
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run out of his hard</font>

511
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,960
drive space speed<font color="#E5E5E5"> is nice when it comes</font>

512
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,850
to hard drives because it allows

513
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,190
snapshots to revert very quickly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

514
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">taken very quickly but space is king</font>

515
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,700
here because you will run into a wall

516
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,530
and you'll hate yourself if you can't

517
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,180
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that snapshot and you're getting to</font>

518
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,730
a point where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're constantly fighting</font>

519
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:18,490
this space so get a big disk and if you

520
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:20,800
can afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> it get a fast big disk some</font>

521
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:24,790
more obscure stuff is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font>

522
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:28,809
specific CPU features<font color="#CCCCCC"> vtx is the key one</font>

523
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:31,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">vtx allows your CPU to do efficient</font>

524
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:34,540
virtualization almost every CPU has it

525
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:37,870
at this point if you go back maybe 2

526
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:40,178
2010 or before you might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

527
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:41,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">some stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't have it but if</font>

528
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:43,809
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy lab hardware that's</font>

529
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,520
the one key thing you definitely want to

530
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:49,420
have is make sure that processor

531
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,950
supports<font color="#CCCCCC"> vtx v TD is another option and</font>

532
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,840
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes on some of the even newer stuff</font>

533
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:55,059
and with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually pass an</font>

534
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,830
entire pci device as if it were

535
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:58,300
connected directly to a virtual<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine</font>

536
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:00,340
so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a virtual</font>

537
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,919
password cracking rig of some sort and

538
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,840
you need to pass the your GPU directly

539
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,670
to a virtual<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine perhaps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font>

540
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,370
do it with v TD<font color="#CCCCCC"> i haven't tried that</font>

541
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:10,470
myself I've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it can be done</font>

542
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's the feature that allows it</font>

543
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,110
AES is another one if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

544
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,520
encrypt your whole lab hard drive AES

and I is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future that allows</font>

546
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,690
efficient encryption when it comes to

547
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:22,330
the package consider if it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

548
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:24,309
travel you could do a laptop or a nuk if

549
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,500
you want a quiet expandable option go

550
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:28,149
with the desktop if your life philosophy

551
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,670
is turned<font color="#CCCCCC"> down for what go with the rack</font>

552
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:34,440
mount you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get something loud</font>

553
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:37,480
and rude but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be awesome so</font>

554
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,179
my recommendation here for minimum specs

555
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,670
would be 16 gigs of ram 500 gigs of hard

556
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:45,070
drive and an i5 from maybe the last four

557
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,990
or five years probably the 2000 series

558
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,389
I've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried with a 1000 but I think</font>

559
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,820
they would probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too ideal would</font>

560
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:54,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">be 32 gigs of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ram at least a terabyte</font>

561
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:58,928
SSD if you can afford it and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> quad core</font>

562
00:19:54,850 --> 00:20:00,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">i7 or Xeon even here's some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

563
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:02,800
favorite hardware it's not actually that

564
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,389
expensive to get these specs whatever

565
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,129
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have already try that first</font>

566
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:09,300
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very likely to work with proxmox if</font>

567
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:11,860
it doesn't here's what I like to go to

568
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,240
this is a Lenovo ThinkPad it's

569
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:16,270
refurbished<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's three hundred and fifty</font>

570
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,220
dollars on newegg it's got<font color="#CCCCCC"> 97</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's got</font>

571
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,360
16 gigs of ram and a one terabyte hard

572
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,850
drive and it's only three hundred fifty

573
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,620
dollars so it's very portable they work

574
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,689
great they can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> hold two hard</font>

575
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,100
drives in them so even better you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

576
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,600
use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a normal laptop boot it off</font>

577
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,060
that and then make it your type 1

578
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,679
hypervisor later on if you want if you

579
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:36,540
want to step up to the tower lenovo

580
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:38,890
makes 80s 140<font color="#E5E5E5"> stands for think server</font>

581
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,230
and the whole line of think servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

582
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:43,720
great but the TS 140 is the little

583
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:45,940
version and the TS 150 is the just

584
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,190
updated<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU version it's not out yet but</font>

585
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,380
they've announced it you can get these

586
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,240
for 389 with a xeon processor and you're

587
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,740
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RAM to that</font>

588
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,090
so it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> end up more like five</font>

589
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,660
hundred dollars but they are great

590
00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:00,040
computers reddit home lab loves these so

591
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're they're battle-tested they're</font>

592
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,790
great you can run esxi on them but

593
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a different</font>

595
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,699
they're compatible they also have a list

596
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:12,490
that posts what type of hypervisors

597
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,440
they're compatible with two if you want

598
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,150
to go with<font color="#E5E5E5"> rack mount and serious server</font>

599
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,380
hardware it just go to the home lab wiki

600
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,700
because there's way too many

601
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,900
considerations for me to come up with

602
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:25,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">any kind of recommendation system there</font>

611
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,260
that's an awesome deal especially if you

612
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,790
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those ts1 40s and maybe that</font>

613
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,370
processor is compatible that would be a

614
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:57,080
great drop in so yeah look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> deals</font>

615
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,540
like that look for refurb that's a great

616
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,610
source when it comes to planning your

617
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,440
network what you want to do is consider

618
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:05,479
these four main pieces obviously your

619
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,580
server but your firewall<font color="#CCCCCC"> and router is</font>

620
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,100
going to play a main piece in this as

621
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:12,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">well as a smart</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> switch I say smart</font>

622
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,750
switch because that is a specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> term</font>

623
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,179
as opposed to a unmanaged cheap switch

624
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,260
that I'm sure you've all seen or a

625
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,600
managed switch which is the really

626
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,340
expensive thing smart switches tend to

627
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,750
be the label that means I kind of have

628
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,280
some professional features but I'm not

629
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:28,280
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to charge you a crazy amount for</font>

630
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,440
it also with the Wi-Fi access points if

631
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,540
you want to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's fairly</font>

632
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,720
complicated get one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> supports 802</font>

633
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:37,970
dot1q which is V LANs and also has multi

634
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">SSIDs that it can broadcast and then</font>

635
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:42,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">direct those to the different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans have</font>

636
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,270
a recommendation for that in a moment

637
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,740
depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want for these</font>

638
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,180
things and what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do you</font>

639
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,550
may actually be able to virtualize the

640
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:52,400
router and the switches probably not the

641
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:54,710
access point but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some options</font>

642
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,120
there if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to buy those so</font>

643
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:59,300
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where you need to make a</font>

644
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,129
decision do you think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to</font>

645
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">put your lab in line with your home</font>

646
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,240
network it can work and it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

647
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:07,190
awesome you can do your<font color="#E5E5E5"> router and</font>

648
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,780
switches and everything have that

649
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:10,520
connect directly to your internet and

650
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,620
have a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome professional setup</font>

651
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,480
at home the issue being is when your

652
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,429
family calls and says the Internet's out

653
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,230
how are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to direct your</font>

654
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:20,300
children to go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your hypervisor and</font>

655
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,950
reset your router vm it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

656
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:25,340
be as easy as unplug it and plug it<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

657
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:30,560
in so yeah or they can submit a help

658
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:32,330
desk ticket right so that being said

659
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,340
don't be too scared<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this I've had</font>

660
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,960
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for years and it's never been</font>

661
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,149
a problem for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> it hasn't happened once</font>

662
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">one thing I would suggest if you do go</font>

663
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,330
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and you're scared of that have</font>

664
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,830
a home normal router setup so they can

665
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,449
just switch the cord over and everything

666
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:46,610
will work with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different Wi-Fi network</font>

667
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,710
that's a way to mitigate that if you

668
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,300
have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> extra machine you can put this</font>

669
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:53,150
as another client on your network just

670
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">like any other device you have but that</font>

671
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come with the</font>

672
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:58,040
downside that you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to buy some</font>

673
00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:00,830
stuff depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

674
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:03,200
do so also<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a dedicated</font>

675
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,399
laptop when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you travel or if you have to</font>

676
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,560
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the laptop you're traveling</font>

677
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">with this is going to make a decision</font>

678
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:12,070
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network you here's what I have</font>

679
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:14,510
at home basically this is a sofa

680
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,310
firewall that I use this is a cisco

681
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:19,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">smart switch is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about eighty dollars and</font>

682
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:22,280
this is a unify Wi-Fi access point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

683
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:27,350
then my lab server very simple physical

684
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:28,940
I do this because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is the most</font>

685
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,980
flexible setup that I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

686
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,170
come up with for a reasonable amount of

687
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,270
money i have veal and support throughout

688
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:37,430
with all of those things so every single

689
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:42,020
we tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a different layer three</font>

690
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:44,420
networks ID for each green so if i

691
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,520
connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> one SSID i might be in my dmz</font>

692
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:49,100
if i connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different SSID i'll be</font>

693
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,200
on my internal network or my thing for

694
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:55,159
Internet of Things devices whatever it

695
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,960
may be all of and VLAN traffic goes

696
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,640
through my router so that inherently

697
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,740
makes not only what I do on my phone and

698
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,080
everything else but all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my lab server</font>

699
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:05,180
traffic visible and I mirror that with

00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,980
the me report on my switch back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

701
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:11,030
lab server where I'm recording it all in

702
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:13,100
full pcap for defense<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMS buy almost</font>

703
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:15,139
anything and add all the networks you

704
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,389
want all<font color="#CCCCCC"> day with it so it's a really</font>

705
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,400
great and flexible setup you don't need

706
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have stuff that supports vlans if you</font>

707
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,540
want to do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in line set up it can all</font>

708
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,980
be virtual so don't too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

709
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:28,639
how does my network look to a packet

710
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:30,350
with those only<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have all these zones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

711
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,450
have a guest zone for when people come

712
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:36,250
over i have a desktop network which is

713
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,250
all my trusted devices like my laptop

714
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:43,150
security onion over here if I'm hosting

715
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">Minecra for my friends or whatever I</font>

716
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:47,390
have internal servers that only I want

717
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> access inside like mine</font>

718
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:52,070
ass and then I have a research isolation

719
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,050
zone of sorts where I do malware reverse

720
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:55,639
engineering and things like that where I

721
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:58,730
want to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff doesn't get</font>

722
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,710
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the internet all of that connects</font>

723
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,670
up through my router and what you can't

724
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,200
see in the middle here<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be my</font>

725
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,700
switch and then anything that goes

726
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,350
through at all through the middle here

727
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,760
is then echoed back to my security

728
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:10,679
monitoring

729
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:14,340
so what specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hardware do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I use for</font>

730
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have the cisco SG 200 oh wait</font>

731
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,939
that works for me it's about eighty

732
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:20,520
dollars but in researching<font color="#CCCCCC"> this talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

733
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,890
found those a thirty dollar tp-link easy

734
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:26,340
smartseries the thing though about that

735
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:27,540
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> version two is what you want to get</font>

736
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,939
because before that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have</font>

737
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:32,180
windows to manage it so something to

738
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,800
know there for your router and firewall

739
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,970
you can do it yourself with pfsense and

740
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">i would highly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend you try this</font>

741
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,690
first because it's a very very

742
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,580
outstanding distribution<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

743
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:44,220
firewall and router you can make all of

744
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,330
the interfaces you want virtually or you

745
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,340
can run it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the separate cheap</font>

746
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:50,090
computer you have at home<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

747
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,860
years ago and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would have no problem</font>

748
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:54,270
so post has a free version of their

749
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,729
professional firewalls there's two

750
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:58,830
versions there's so post UTM which is

751
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:00,690
the old kind and then there's the XG

752
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,879
firewall which is the new kind these

753
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:05,340
both come with tons and tons of awesome

754
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,530
options you get antivirus you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs</font>

755
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,449
you get proxies you can filter

756
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:12,270
categories you can do anything you want

757
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,340
that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> system administrator at a company</font>

758
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:15,450
with a real device of theirs would be

759
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,280
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do they give you almost</font>

760
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:19,680
everything free the only downside is

761
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,720
that you have a 50 IP limit so if you

762
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,640
have a lot of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your home network</font>

763
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,620
and you want to run a big lab you might

764
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,600
have an issue there if you want to go

765
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,760
with physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware the ubiquity edge</font>

768
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,750
dhcp dns all that stuff built in so

769
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:40,590
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good cheap option for for</font>

770

physical Wi-Fi you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a Wi-Fi</font>

775
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,510
backup to your router and firewall which

776
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,879
will be making<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decisions for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you so</font>

777
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,620
with that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the access point</font>

778
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,150
you already have and run it in AP mode

779
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,840
and just connect it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the switch it</font>

780
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:02,310
doesn't need to be the router anymore

781
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,199
also if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this in the</font>

00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:07,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">professional way that allows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs and</font>

783
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,810
all of that the ubiquity unify AC series

784
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:12,690
is great they are ninety dollars for the

785
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:14,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">minimum one that they sell and one</font>

hundred fifty dollars for their all out

787
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:20,040
ac pro router access point these will

788
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,729
allow you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make all the SSIDs you want</font>

00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,120
confuse earn a

790
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:25,080
vers do all sorts of wild stuff so

791
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,149
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably as cheap as</font>

792
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,540
enterprise-grade Wi-Fi gets i would i

793
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:32,100
would highly recommend those so do you

794
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:34,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to buy any of this no you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

795
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,090
I made reference to you can really just

796
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,860
have your lab<font color="#E5E5E5"> server sit there right</font>

797
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,809
next to your internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection and</font>

798
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,969
have just a single Wi-Fi access point

799
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:43,918
hanging off that you can virtualize your

800
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,960
router your switches and have this be a

801
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,520
VLAN trunk or something like that

802
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,720
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> options that</font>

803
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you really don't have</font>

804
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,020
to buy this stuff if you don't want to

805
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,690
if you want to go for challenge mode

806
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:57,960
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux piece of software called</font>

807
00:28:54,690 --> 00:29:00,270
host APD with the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

809
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,299
hardware supports it you could try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

810
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:06,830
it all actually in literally one

811
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:06,830
computer but I've never tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

812
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,678
virtual networking concepts this is

813
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's going to be important</font>

814
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:17,130
as we jump into how to do the networking

815
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:19,350
here so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> one quick note assume when</font>

816
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:21,600
I say Nick for the rest of this I mean

817
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,040
like dropping one card in with one

818
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,449
interface on I know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably not</font>

819
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,159
technically the right term but I wanted

820
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:29,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I could make easily</font>

821
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,480
distinguishable so for our lab server

822
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,799
we're going to have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

823
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,710
complication here we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have</font>

824
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:36,690
multiple virtual machines with multiple

00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,970
virtual<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick's that connect to multiple</font>

826
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,740
virtual switches and all of those are

827
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to connect to your physical ports</font>

828
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,400
which are going to connect to

829
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,080
potentially a virtualized router there's

830
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,730
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of complication going on there and</font>

831
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,860
there's a lot of ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font>

832
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:51,440
hook that up some of the terms that

833
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:53,280
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably seen with a type</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

834
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:58,320
installation are going to be bridged

835
00:29:53,280 --> 00:30:00,120
host only internal and nap mode in type

836
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:05,840
2 hypervisors this is what it calls them

837
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:07,918
in vmware workstation and virtualbox so

838
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,780
bridge mode is probably the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most common</font>

839
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,700
what it looks like here is you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

840
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:14,010
virtual switch out in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your host</font>

of your guests VMs look like just

<font color="#E5E5E5">another device on the network so if you</font>

you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows you want to run bhuntu</font>

also you do this mode if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting</font>

you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run like metasploit able</font>

something you don't want accessible<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

851
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,290
the outside then you start turning to

852
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,530
host only networking

853
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:40,590
host only networking puts a virtual

second<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick on your actual host PC and</font>

855
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:44,970
it connects that to a virtual switch

856
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:46,470
which is shared<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the guest VM the</font>

857
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,810
important piece here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that traffic</font>

858
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,820
cannot go this way it will not route

859
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:52,320
between these two interfaces so your

860
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,909
computer can talk to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vm your</font>

861
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,090
computer can talk to the internet but

862
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:58,920
this cannot go all the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> out so the</font>

863
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:01,290
other option would be internal

864
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,660
networking this is where you have your

865
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:05,399
host PC doing everything like normal but

866
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,140
you have multiple virtual machines that

867
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,970
can talk to each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other but not to your</font>

868
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual computer so if you're doing</font>

869
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:13,320
malware analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something like that</font>

870
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:16,140
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need complete isolation this is</font>

871
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:18,450
the mode you're going to want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use the</font>

872
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,550
last option you'll see is nap mode that

873
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:22,610
mode is going to allow your computer to

874
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:24,930
act pretty much like a home router

875
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:27,209
netting all of the traffic behind it out

876
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:28,710
one IP if you're on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> plane and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

877
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,170
to use VMs and you've bought<font color="#CCCCCC"> Boingo</font>

878
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:33,420
access and you only get one IP this is

879
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:35,520
the mode you use at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hotel whatever it</font>

880
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,560
may be you<font color="#CCCCCC"> put them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all in that mode and</font>

881
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,889
it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> one computer making</font>

882
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:42,600
traffic type one virtual networking

883
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,310
you're doing the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it does</font>

884
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,870
not hold your hand you're manually

885
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:48,360
making virtual switches and you're

886
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:50,449
manually making these connections all

887
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,260
the concepts<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the same though</font>

888
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,400
typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to be bridged</font>

889
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,940
mode because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to want your</font>

890
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:58,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">VMs in your hypervisor to be able to</font>

891
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,630
talk outbound so a lot of what we're

892
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,400
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing is making a virtual</font>

893
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,930
switch connecting our VM to that and

894
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,980
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> connecting that switch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

895
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:09,810
physical port where it can talk outbound

896
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:12,030
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is if you want to do</font>

897
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:13,169
it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans you're going to define the</font>

898
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,270
zones<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want you're going to make</font>

899
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:17,550
switches that are tagged<font color="#E5E5E5"> with those VLAN</font>

900
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:19,170
numbers connect everything to those and

901
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:22,290
then make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure those map correctly to</font>

902
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:24,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the outside and then everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

903
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:28,050
work like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so the idea there is all</font>

904
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:29,550
the traffic gets tagged with a VLAN and

905
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,960
then it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the virtual switch the</font>

906
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:33,750
virtual switch sends the outbound on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

907
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,190
VLAN trunk to your smart switch which

908
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,810
can then push it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to your router and</font>

909
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:38,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">then the firewall rules get applied at</font>

910
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:39,810
that point and then it can go back into

911
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,180
your network or wherever it's going from

912
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:44,190
there if you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar with VLANs</font>

913
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,710
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't used them at home this</font>

914
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:48,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what's going on</font>

915
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:50,809
if you want to have multiple different

916
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:53,429
computers on multiple different networks

917
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:56,220
subnets that is you could connect them

918
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:57,809
all directly to a router but we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

919
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,159
reuse our<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware so what we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

920
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,799
is we're allowing multiple different

921
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">vlans and type three networks to go</font>

922
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:05,490
through the same physical link so we

923
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:07,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">have one ethernet cable here and here</font>

924
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:10,559
and then in my case at home this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

925
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,299
virtual switch these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMs and then</font>

926
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,428
the traffic from these two things would

927
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:15,960
have to go out through here up to the

928
00:33:14,429 --> 00:33:17,399
router and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then back in if I wanted to</font>

929
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,529
talk from D to see if we go all the way

930
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:20,580
up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> back down so trunk is just the</font>

931
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:23,789
name for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing that's carrying</font>

932
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:25,770
multiple different<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans on one link and</font>

933
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:28,980
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get efficiency with this</font>

934
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:31,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">set up with your hardware so for ESX</font>

935
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,700
this is how you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you make your port</font>

936
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:34,080
groups there's four different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you</font>

937
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,480
need to understand there's pork groups

938
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,149
virtual switches physical nicks and vm

939
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,940
kernels your port group is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

940
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:44,340
the group that where the VLAN tags are

941
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,080
applied so you set those up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you make</font>

942
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,970
all your zones and then you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

943
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,399
virtual switches and you assign those

944
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:52,350
port groups to a virtual switch then you

945
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,689
take your physical Nick and you attach

946
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:57,750
that switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that physical Nick and</font>

947
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:59,820
then you also take the vm Colonel Nick

948
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,470
which is the port and IP you want to

949
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,750
manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> ESX on and you connect that</font>

950
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:05,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">wherever you want also now the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

951
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,169
know about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to tap the</font>

952
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:09,480
virtual traffic it's very easy but you

953
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:12,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to set up promiscuous mode and you</font>

954
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,679
have to set it to accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> so make sure</font>

955
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,399
you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be able to</font>

956
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:21,000
echo that traffic back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to another vm</font>

957
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:23,310
with esxi for individual<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMS then you go</font>

958
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,899
in there and you create them and you

959
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:26,250
attach them to a port group so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

960
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:27,899
done here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've made three different</font>

961
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:29,940
virtual machines three different<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans</font>

962
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,899
it might be a little bit too small<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

963
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,089
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it says windows domain</font>

964
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:35,159

965
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:36,330
servers I just named it that that's one

desktops and then a Windows 7 desktop

968
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,599
and that group Ivy Lynn DMZ and then my

969

management<font color="#CCCCCC"> network for esxi these are</font>

973
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:54,030
to the physical port which will be

985
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,330
you can assign an IP to those switches

986
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:23,970
this is one difference between proxmox

987
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:26,640
and ESX that doesn't have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> vm Colonel</font>

989
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,180
to manage proxmox so be careful where

990
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,259
you assign an IP because if you assign

991
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,790
it to the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to your</font>

992
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,410
internet side then you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

993
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:36,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to manage proxmox from the outside</font>

994
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:38,100
that's bad if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be able to tap</font>

995
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:40,470
this traffic what you do is you take

996
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,750
this command be our CTL it stands for

997
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:45,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">bridge control and you do set aging the</font>

998
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:47,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">name of the bridge and 0 what that does</font>

999
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,770
is makes the virtual switch forget which

1000
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:51,690
mac address is on which port so it sends

1001
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,820
all traffic to all ports essentially

1002
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:55,500
making it a virtual hub and then any vm

1003
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,880
that goes into promiscuous mode will be

1004
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,600
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see the traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can tap</font>

1005
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,700
it that way when your virtual machine

1006
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,140
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just create your</font>

1007
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,490
virtual device and you tag it with

1008
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:09,990
whatever you want you attach it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

1009
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:12,540
switch so not a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1010
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:14,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">server same type of thing what to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1011
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,740
about this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> however many physical</font>

1012
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,750
connections you have to the outside with

1013
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:21,180
Nick cards it will create two switches

1014
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:23,310
for that so in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a network 0</font>

1015
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,080
and network or network 0 and network one

1016
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:27,690
where auto made with nikk 0 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick one</font>

1017
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:30,420
and then I made these three these are

1018
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:32,760
all vlans switches and those VLAN

1019
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,890
switches have a number associated with

1020
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">them so when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I create virtual machines</font>

1021
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:40,680
then you attach them to this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> maps</font>

1022
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:42,090
to a physical Nick and then also a VLAN

1023
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,370
number so your traffic will be tagged

1024
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:47,580
that way and here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that looks like</font>

1025
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:49,140
at my windows 7 vm networking tab and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:22,450
just creating them inside this virtual

you want but you create all the switches

1042
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,419
you want there and then in your

1043

individual virtual machines you just go

1044
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:36,430
to custom and you pick whatever switch

1045
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:38,589
it is you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect it to with</font>

networks and your host only networks

1048
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:44,650
these are also creating virtual switches

1049
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:46,480
and then inside your vm you tell it

1050
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:48,670
which one you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect to one</font>

and virtual box<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so which virtual</font>

got our<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware we've got our</font>

hypervisors now the most important part

1065
00:38:16,809 --> 00:38:22,119
is picking what type of software<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

going to actually run we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1067
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:26,349
pick all of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMs and before we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1068
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:28,510
anything we're going to snapshot all of

1069
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:30,190
them snapshotting allows us to mess up

1070
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:31,839
anything we want and immediately go back

1071
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:34,809
to a known good state with one press of

1072
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,130
a button that's very convenient and

1073
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:37,270
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to collect all your VMs</font>

1107
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:47,440
you do there is you just make sure you

snap shot before you boot it for the

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge pain so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to get something</font>

00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:24,980
all probably heard of pen to black arch

00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:26,810
back box all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff but the goal</font>

1153
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:29,150
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is get that vm get whatever you</font>

1154
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:31,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">want but you want the infrastructure to</font>

1155
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:33,320
match the corporate style network so

1156
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,400
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to want a multi-segment</font>

1157
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,530
network and that's what we're going to

1158
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,450
be designing with that vm set up so i

1159
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:41,030
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest making maybe a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dmz a</font>

1160
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:43,339
desktops VLAN a<font color="#E5E5E5"> server is maybe a guest</font>

1161
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:45,560
you could do a Wi-Fi VLAN all of that

1162
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:47,869
stuff make your own mini company inside

1163
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,700
your server and then you can attach this

1164
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:51,800
distribution anywhere you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1165
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,660
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on the VLAN for desktops and you</font>

1166
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,340
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretend you have remote control of</font>

00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone's computer or you have an</font>

1168
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,820
unauthorized device on the network you

1169
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,680
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it on the outside view in you</font>

1170
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,960
can try to attack the DMZ servers and

1171
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:05,299
try to pivot your way inside once you do

1172
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,000
that you can put up<font color="#E5E5E5"> your defense VMs and</font>

1173
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:09,980
try to stop them or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is but</font>

1174
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,690
before you do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that snapshot at all</font>

1175
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:15,200
first so whatever you do you can easily

1176
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:16,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to a known good state so attack</font>

1177
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,919
from all of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> places pivot around</font>

1178
00:42:16,609 --> 00:42:21,348
try to stop yourself try to catch

1179
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,119
yourself and that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> make you a truly</font>

1180
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:25,040
great attacker and defender and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1181
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,160
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important this gets to the purple</font>

1182
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,540
team concept you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> become a much</font>

1183
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,549
better defender if you understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

1184
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,509
attackers work and vice versa so this

1185
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,700
will allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in a very</font>

1186
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:36,250
effective way you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also do</font>

1187
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,569
interesting things like mixing in

1188
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:40,849
physical components if you had an extra

1189
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:42,710
Nick you could attach printers you could

1190
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:44,510
attach your slow cooker your IOT devices

1191
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:47,330
light bulbs whatever you want put it on

1192
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:49,820
its<font color="#E5E5E5"> own VLAN attached to your server and</font>

1193
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:51,859
bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> that into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the mix also and then</font>

1194
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:54,050
check if your defense picked it up it's

1195
00:42:51,859 --> 00:42:56,480
a good good way to learn the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

1196
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:59,030
process and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1197
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,920
do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is script it all up so with</font>

1198
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:04,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">VMware there's a vm run command or vim</font>

1199
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:06,800
CMD for ESX you can say revert to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1200
00:43:04,609 --> 00:43:08,630
snapshot by name you list them all on a

1201
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,250
script and it will revert your whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lab</font>

1202
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,980
bring up the whole infrastructure again

1203
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:16,190
clean so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very convenient VirtualBox</font>

1204
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:18,020
also has vbox<font color="#E5E5E5"> managed to do that here's</font>

1205
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:19,520
what that looks like so with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1206
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:21,349
offensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup you have a lab that</font>

1207
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,300
mirrors a mini corporate network so

1208
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:25,250
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a desktop view in here of</font>

1209
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,940
sorts you've got internal servers and

1210
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,069
you got a deal

1211
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:31,190
see that is going to connect out your

1212
00:43:28,069 --> 00:43:33,040
VLAN trunk to a physical switch or later

1213
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:35,030
on I'll explain the all virtual version

1214
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,950
then you can go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your Wi-Fi access</font>

1215
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:39,079
point if you want to connect with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1216
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:40,970
outside laptop into your internal server

1217
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:42,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">network you just make an SSID that's on</font>

1218
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:45,140
that VLAN you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretend you're over</font>

1219
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:48,560
here from being outside on your Wi-Fi so

1220
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:50,328
it's very very flexible so about defense

1221
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,578
what should you use if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to play</font>

1222
00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:54,859
defense if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't done this before</font>

1223
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:57,319
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> highly recommend security onion</font>

1224
00:43:54,859 --> 00:43:59,359
security onion is like the blue team

1225
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:01,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">Callie it allows you to do network</font>

1226
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,770
security monitoring which is focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1227
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:06,140
data in motion and what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font>

1228
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:08,089
records all of your traffic it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

1229
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,618
full pcap of everything on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network</font>

1230
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:12,170
that it can see so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will depend</font>

1231
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:15,020
where you tap it it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs built in so</font>

1232
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:17,060
snort suricata bro<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs it's got front</font>

1233
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:20,000
ends for it<font color="#CCCCCC"> available it also comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1234
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:21,560
Elsa which is a sim like solution and

1235
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">then for packet forensics it comes with</font>

1236
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,369
a bunch of tools explico<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network minor</font>

1237
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:27,410
and grep and all of that type of stuff

1238
00:44:25,369 --> 00:44:30,619
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great solution there's some books</font>

1239
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:32,540
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Richard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> balak on installing this and</font>

1240
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:34,640
a bunch of other documentation online

1241
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:36,079
this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> created by Doug Burks and he's</font>

1242
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,060
done a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of presentations that you can</font>

1243
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,560
google on setting this up it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy</font>

1244
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:41,299
its quick annexed a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font>

1245
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,279
rebooting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then essentially doing it</font>

1246
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:45,349
again and telling it what interfaces you

1247
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,230
want for monitoring and for management

1248
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:50,030
and that's pretty much it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so to do that</font>

1249
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:52,940
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> about three gigs of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ram and</font>

1250
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:54,619
enough cpu to support the motion through

1251
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,109
it snort is obviously going to take a

1252
00:44:54,619 --> 00:44:58,069
proportional amount of bandwidth

1253
00:44:56,109 --> 00:45:00,650
compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the amount of traffic it</font>

1254
00:44:58,069 --> 00:45:02,599
sees to analyze all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but most</font>

1255
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:04,040
importantly you're going to need enough

1256
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:05,900
space to save everything that goes

1257
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,849
across your network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can estimate</font>

1258
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that by looking at your router now it</font>

00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:36,890
what that looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's essentially</font>

one for the vm traffic the VLAN trunk

1318
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:14,000

a fake dns server and a fake website and

1320

that snapshot everything and then you

begin your traffic interception start

1335
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:49,310
your virus and then infect analyze all

you can download and install container

<font color="#E5E5E5">VMs which use almost no resources</font>

three users instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so think</font>

about doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can virtualize real</font>

infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> and test that and not</font>

1414
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:41,770
bring the risk of taking down<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1415
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:43,330
actual infrastructure for a pen test you

1416
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:45,580
could try out the honeypot pm's there's

1417
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:46,810
a lot of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there for that and if</font>

1418
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:50,830
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need more than that there's the red</font>

1419
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:52,690
at home lab wiki and site that will give

1420
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:54,759
you a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more options some further</font>

1421
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:57,040
reference for this there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a lot</font>

1422
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,480
of talks about setting up a vm lab and

1423
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,890
b-sides and they're all great they've

1424
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,660
all kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of taken a different angle I</font>

1425
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:03,040
took this angle because I hadn't seen

1426
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:04,170
this done before but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other</font>

1427
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,279
ones here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would highly recommend</font>

1428
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:07,870
this is setting up a test lab with

1429
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">VMware by Nicholas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Chapel he actually</font>

1430
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:12,009
walks through installing ESX creating

1431
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:13,450
the data stores and things like that

1432
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:15,070
that it takes to actually get it running

1433
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:16,870
so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that that will be a</font>

1434
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:20,920
walk through there here's one on doing

1435
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:22,270
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all in the cloud ec2 robust there's</font>

1436
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,160
one called building a cyber range by

1437
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:25,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kevin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cardwell and a book that goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1438
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,549
it called building virtual penetration

1439
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:29,080
testing labs for advanced penetration

1440
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:30,790
testing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was all focused on</font>

1441
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,890
emulating a customer environment so you

1442
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:34,480
can pen test on it there's also a

1443
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:35,980
proxmox cookbook i found out there

1444
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,380
although i haven't read and camp pouch

1445
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:43,730
for that question on the cloud yes

1446
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:47,430
providers have ruled out Scott right and

1447
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:48,810
what's the yeah so i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure i</font>

1448
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:51,060
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done myself but i know that</font>

1449
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:52,440
amazon allows you to do like the VPC

1450
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:54,270
where all of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network would</font>

1451
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,830
theoretically be internal to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own vm</font>

1452
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:57,300
so if you're doing it like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font>

1453
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:58,950
imagine it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's probably</font>

1454
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">just when it gets outbound if you're</font>

1455
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:03,299
doing host only and internal only stuff

1456
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:05,520
i would think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but they</font>

1457
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:07,530
have a whole pen testing site for pen

1458
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:12,300
testing with AWS so you can check into

1459
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:14,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rules there all right so the TLDR in</font>

1460
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:17,130
case you started daydreaming here's all
