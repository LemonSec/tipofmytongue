didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even know existed on this laptop</font>

130
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,919
I was convinced I had to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a button</font>

131

<font color="#CCCCCC">that was not on my laptop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that is</font>

failed some more<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fill three more times</font>

136
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:40,609
and then finally through pure brute

137
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:42,709
force I started learning this stuff

138
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:44,688
through a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of mentorship and a</font>

139
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:46,609
little guidance from the w CTF team I've

140
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:51,819
actually was able to put in a flag and

141
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:53,959
get like at least a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> points so</font>

00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:57,229
going to go over the game the challenges

144
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:58,969
some methodologies the team of solo

145
00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:11,539
strategy offense of Defense and then

146
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:14,058
some gear stuff so so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wireless</font>

147
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:15,799
it's a wireless ETF but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's kind</font>

148
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:18,139
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup standards that other CTFs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

149
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:19,969
you've got rules points prizes and

150
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:21,019
opponents and sometimes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one you</font>

151
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:22,459
can't even see your opponent<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

152
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:24,829
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be further away because it's</font>

153
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:27,919
wireless not everyone's going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

when you go to their website you submit

157
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:37,129
your flag but it's not like there's not

158
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:39,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a scoreboard or just like a there's</font>

yourself into one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing or one problem</font>

185
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,900
there they have so many different

186
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,719
challenges that you can try whether it's

187
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:08,060
SDR they just introduced SCADA they've

188
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,680
got some<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth stuff there's a bunch</font>

189
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,199
of Wi-Fi there's different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

190
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,660
Wi-Fi so if one is your problem for you

191
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,650
try another one and come back to it so

192
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:20,600
don't give up but don't stay on the one

193
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,370
challenge like I did for six hours and

194
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:28,000
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out why web doesn't</font>

195
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:32,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">work so it's wireless you cannot see</font>

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:37,370
what's not there but that's the thing

197
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:39,710
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can decide it's you know it's Wi-Fi</font>

198
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,630
you know it's Bluetooth you know that

199
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,220
those things are out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there start your</font>

200
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,750
scans know what you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

201
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:49,700
know what you want to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for</font>

202
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:56,150
and go from there the challenge is of

203
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:57,560
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe with Def Con they just</font>

204
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">introduced a little bit more Bluetooth</font>

205
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,469
stuff especially with the release of

206
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,970
blue Hydra really cool tool if you've

207
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,490
not downloaded it go to github and get

208
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,260
it I've rented it a couple of different

209
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,580
places and it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool the things</font>

210
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,980
that are running<font color="#CCCCCC"> bluetooth that you</font>

211
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:19,520
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a running bluetooth I</font>

212
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:24,520
I I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I walked the entire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> der beek on and</font>

213
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:29,240
saw really really interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so</font>

214
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:31,160
there's Wi-Fi there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> SDR all this stuff</font>

215
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,950
is low entry on equipment you can come

216
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,260
in and participate think outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box</font>

217
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:37,670
they may very well start introducing

218
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,340
things like toasters that we have to

219
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">take over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and burn toast to get points</font>

220
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:55,310
like that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be cool I'm taking</font>

221
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:57,890
credit if you do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so so what</font>

222
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,869
do I do now<font color="#E5E5E5"> like when you show up like</font>

223
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,069
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just assumed sometimes that you</font>

224
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,750
know exactly what you're supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

225
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:05,290
already do like with other red team

226
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:08,630
events that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you plug in and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

227
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,949
scanning so pick the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

228
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,010
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look for pick the thing that you</font>

229
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,390
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do pick Wi-Fi pick whatever else</font>

230
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:17,060
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do like if it's Bluetooth</font>

231
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,230
you want to go after the speakers and

232
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,839
play your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own music because they've</font>

233
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:26,200
picked some kind of weird esoteric

234
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:26,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">freakin EDM from goth days or something</font>

235
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:35,160
yeah yeah

236
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,390
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to start I'm pod to start</font>

237
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:44,400
off with negative points just like

238
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:46,140
shmoocon so so take notes as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go I</font>

239
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,870
can't emphasize this enough because

240
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:51,480
there were times that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had assigned</font>

241
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">WLAN one to do one thing and I signed</font>

242
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">WLAN</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to to do another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I came</font>

243
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:57,450
back and I decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was going to do</font>

244
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,950
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else and I assigned WLAN one</font>

245
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,140
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so everything I was doing on</font>

246
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,280
the other pain like it failed because I

247
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,069
wasn't collecting anymore or doing

248
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,839
anything so take notes<font color="#CCCCCC"> write what you</font>

249
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">see right what you don't see if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> /</font>

250
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:15,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">hear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people talking about something</font>

251
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:18,480
steal from them so from my perspective

252
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:21,350
get in get logged in get their word<font color="#CCCCCC"> list</font>

253
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,160
downloaded look at their past<font color="#CCCCCC"> freaking</font>

254
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,830
presentations and what they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> at other</font>

255
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,719
places because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

256
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,630
homework ahead of time and see all the

257
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:35,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">things you want to do settle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in put all</font>

258
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:38,370
up your stuff do not over multitask do

259
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,200
not over multitask your computer may not

260
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:45,540
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> handle it unless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you brought</font>

261
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:47,160
your your gaming rig from home know what

262
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:51,360
you're good at give it a good shot and

263
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,740
then try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and have fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the rest they</font>

264
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,510
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> brought up a bunch of skate of</font>

265
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,310
stuff I have no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> about scale abut</font>

266
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:59,210
I'm about to hit it<font color="#CCCCCC"> today and I'm about</font>

267
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:07,589
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just hurt my brain as hard as I can</font>

268
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:08,970
or tomorrow take it in chunks if you go

269
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,350
to there if you go to their scoreboard

270
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,520
at the bottom you can see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

271
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,470
flags are you can see the different

272
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,490
styles<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like different things like you</font>

273
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,230
can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there possibly going to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">have this and that it's kind of like</font>

275
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,880
looking ahead do lots of googling lots

276
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,900
of googling there's wireless stuff all

277
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,840
over the place from different years but

278
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:30,630
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of help on the internet so</font>

279
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,120
what if you get stuck ask others ask

280
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,830

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,230
together and share information<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

340
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,050
nothing none of this cyber security

341
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:54,370
stuff will work anyway so<font color="#E5E5E5"> join</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a team</font>

342
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:56,560
have some fun but if you're not on a

343
00:16:54,370 --> 00:17:00,430
team go there have fun ask questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

344
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:03,520
it's it's not add eliminating all right

345
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:05,589
look share with your team but if you're

346
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:09,849
not whispering I swear I will steal<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

347
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:11,379
flags break stuff up if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a guy</font>

348
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:12,669
that's your strong Wi-Fi guy and you're

349
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,079
the strong against the<font color="#E5E5E5"> yard guy start</font>

350
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,689
start knocking it out at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time</font>

351
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:21,129
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start scoring fast and often</font>

352
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:23,520
all right it helps with what i did a

353
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:26,890
charm was when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did find the Wi-Fi fox</font>

354
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,490
i actually didn't turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Wi-Fi fox in</font>

355
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:32,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">i turned it off and left it in my pocket</font>

356
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:34,150
because while that was going on

357
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,800
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else was still looking for the</font>

358
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">fox and i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the room scoring points</font>

359
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:46,810
on other challenges

360
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:50,260
so yeah they're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> not scoring points</font>

361
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:54,450
either so communicate with<font color="#CCCCCC"> your team</font>

362
00:17:50,260 --> 00:18:00,250
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a way we actually tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

363
00:17:54,450 --> 00:18:02,140
walk we tried to follow 0 at shmoocon<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

364
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,880
I saw him<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave with the bag that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I knew</font>

365
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,950
the SDR Fox was in and we're

366
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,210
communicating through slack found out

367
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,760
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good idea because there's a</font>

368
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:11,350
delay so he went<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the door and my</font>

369
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,000
teammates finally got to the door he's

370
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,320
already gone so we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually going</font>

371
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:23,290
to follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> him to the fought like the</font>

372
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:30,760
actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fox and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it alright</font>

373
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:32,379

377
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:43,870
door to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the SDR fox or Wi-Fi or</font>

378
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,150
Wi-Fi hide-and-seek I went over<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

379
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,489
booth like the actual registration table

380
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:51,400
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the conference and I started pulling</font>

381
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:53,650
apart t-shirts I was lifting up the

382
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,270
skirt for the table I actually got on my

383
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,430
hands and knees it was rolling around on

384
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,389
the floor in and out of between<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

385
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:01,090
because I was looking for the

386
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:04,240
hide-and-seek object I finally find it

387
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:07,600
in a paper cup hidden underneath like

388
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,570
the behind the table leg so do not be

389
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,639
afraid to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get down and dirty to look for</font>

390
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,110
the hide-and-seek they will stick it

391
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,370
anywhere they think his nest<font color="#CCCCCC"> day I think</font>

392
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:19,000
one time they put it behind a painting

hotel or the room number to say that you

396
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,010
were even<font color="#E5E5E5"> close to it so</font>

397
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:41,680
so often<font color="#CCCCCC"> sand defense is in play so Josh</font>

website and posting old information<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

401
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:55,300

bring your Wi-Fi pineapple and you can

404
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:02,350
run karma and you can be a jerk but they

405
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:04,330

<font color="#E5E5E5">the Wi-Fi Fox and I noticed every time</font>

419
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:38,320
one of the competitors walked by me I

420
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:40,000
got stronger signal and as he walked

421
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,970
away the signal went down he was

422
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,010
replaying the Fox as a part of red

423
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:48,490
teaming so that nobody knew what was

424
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:50,020
going on and that's why I when I finally

425
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,730
found the Fox because i had to pay

426
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention that if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually got a good</font>

427
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,120
signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had to make sure he wasn't</font>

428
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,580
nowhere around so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i knew it was actually</font>

429
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,320
actual real Fox so that's why I turned

430
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Fox off and put it my pocket because</font>

431
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,220
he was still replaying it the whole time

432
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:05,860
so people were still seeing with that

433
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:08,290
mac address and that SSID<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

434
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:10,959
still seeing foxy so everybody still

435
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:12,340
thought the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fox was out but it wasn't he</font>

436
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,750
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually trolling himself cuz he</font>

437
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:23,770
actually still kept going out looking

438
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:26,430
for the Fox<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all right gear none</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font>

439
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:29,440
stuff is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> commercial-grade</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hardcore</font>

442
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,750

443
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:37,900
hack RF just because I wanted one for

444
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,700
doing SDR but I got the port of pack and

445
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,740
I did all kinds of stuff but uh there's

446
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,940
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

447
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,490
come in with ten thousand dollars worth

448
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:52,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">the gear</font>

449

to get flags unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cryptos as a</font>

450
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:56,059
matter of fact my current setup is based

451
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,400
on what his setup was when he won a

452
00:21:56,059 --> 00:22:00,980
competition<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the bicycle race thing</font>

453
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,710
like the way that he had the USB hub and

454
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,490
the way just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I stole often ideas off</font>

455
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:08,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">other people so why reinvent the wheel</font>

456
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:12,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">know your gear and test your gear I</font>

457
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:14,210
still fail at this I still don't test my

458
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:16,460
gear I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling you to test it because</font>

459
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:18,110
you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a position like me and</font>

460
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,840
he'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you this morning that the pen</font>

461
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:23,209
to load that I installed crashes and

462
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,939
does a kernel panic when you put your

463
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:28,220
Wi-Fi into monitor mode so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

464
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:31,220
two laptops are going to kernel panic on

465
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,800
me for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> game because I didn't test my</font>

466
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,630
gear before I showed up so now I might

467
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:41,919
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> try and download a different pen</font>

468
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:47,500
to over Dotel Wi-Fi oh it is alright

469
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,500
sweet but seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> test your gear</font>

470
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:59,470
so a cool and interesting story that I

471
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:03,169
cool and interesting thing I learned I

472
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:04,820
was walking around with the SDR the

473
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:07,880
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray SDR and I had a little bass</font>

474
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:10,370
and I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the giant antenna that I</font>

475
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,190
could telescoping antenna they were they

476
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:14,389
told me you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to find the</font>

477
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,130
thing that's right in front of your face

478
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:18,290
within tha's antenna that's over<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

479
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:21,650
head so they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent me packing</font>

480
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:23,990
and looking for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> freakin paper clip but</font>

481
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:26,870
I then stuck into the end of my SDR and

482
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:29,630
now because I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a terrible antenna</font>

483
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:32,360
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not getting the freakin signal from</font>

484
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:34,550
like somebody's blender making a

485
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,649
smoothie two blocks away I'm actually

486
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:39,440
getting what the actual SDR Fox is right

487
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:41,420
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front of my face so I actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

488
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,040
crap as soon as I stuck that in I went

489
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,890
straight<font color="#CCCCCC"> out found the Fox</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and came</font>

490
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,290
right back it I mean it was that quick

491
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,970
because I had it was so fine tuned in

492
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:51,830
just what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in front of me as soon as</font>

493
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:59,390
I actually had the signal that was the

494
00:23:51,830 --> 00:24:01,970
actual Fox so I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> from I brought</font>

495
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:04,550
literally nothing to I brought too much

496
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:07,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">I went on amazon i did like a buying</font>

Wi-Fi antennas i'm buying AC cards that

499
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,420
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even work on freaking linux yet</font>

500
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:20,990
like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just I I need to die I was so mad</font>

501
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,370
at myself for the very first<font color="#E5E5E5"> w CTF that</font>

502
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,440
I decided that I wasn't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let</font>

503
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,699
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me again so I decided</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

504
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:31,610
go on a purchasing spree and I got

505
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:34,450
single people money so so so I bought a

506
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,449
few Wi-Fi dongle

507
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:42,990
so most of the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the gear that you</font>

508
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,490
need to participate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is anywhere</font>

509
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,930
from twenty to a hundred dollars and

510
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,550
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred dollars because you</font>

511
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:49,920
bought one Wi-Fi dongle one bluetooth

512
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:52,470
dongle and one SDR they are at<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

513
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,840
twenty dollars and below so you can

participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> for relatively easy and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

515
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:01,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the box random bits and bobs when you</font>

516
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,530
go out looking for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fox make sure</font>

517
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've got one of these really cool</font>

518
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:07,230
external batteries for your for your

519
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,620
devices because when you're out there

520
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:12,420
for two hours looking you're gonna start

521
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,709
running out of juice and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may get</font>

525
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:23,340
recommend this because when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start</font>

526
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:25,350
putting in the Wi-Fi dongle and the SDR

00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,120
dongle in the side of your computer the

528
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,379
stuff like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> USBs are like right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

530
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:35,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fit at the same time the dongles too</font>

531
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:36,980
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so different styles of</font>

antennas directional omnidirectional

533
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:42,150
know what your antennas can do know what

they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do for you phone or tablet the</font>

537
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">fix that that it's not the only tool</font>

538
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:53,330
that you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm actually developing</font>

539
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:56,580
something right now and homemade stuff

540
00:25:53,330 --> 00:26:01,710
because of the paperclip incident I back

541
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:06,590
I actually got a SMA to BNC connector

542
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,590
I've hot glued a<font color="#E5E5E5"> paperclip into it</font>

543
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:12,969
so now i have a homemade permanent

544
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:15,010
paperclip antenna so that I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

547
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:33,280
what I want I'm grown<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so so</font>

548
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:35,979
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> i copied somebody and I had this</font>

549
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,760
giant USB with 19 dongles in it because

550
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:41,080
I did my single people money thing I

couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still couldn't crack anything</font>

and come to find out I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was over</font>

553
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:48,040
saturating the USB bus when you are

554
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:50,500
pulling in that much information from

555
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:54,220
five different cards doing arrow dump

556

kismet doing everything else it is not

557

going to work for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then if you</font>

558
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,330
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do SDR at the same time you were</font>
