all these cool things in the information

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,349
security industry at least in my area we

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,240
have a negative unemployment rate that

21
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,089
means there's more jobs than there are

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,429
qualified people that's great position

23
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,330
to be in if you possess the skills that

24
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,910
people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for so if there are</font>

25
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,740
more info SEC jobs than people what are

26
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:22,440
the qualities that people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

27
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,050
for on that that recruiters are looking

28
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,820
for to get John and get you in the door

29
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:32,429
what what do you think recruiters are

30
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:34,080
looking for just shout it out experience

31
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,120
excellent what else our recruiters

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:42,150
looking for went to get that new info

33
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:44,400
SEC job what somebody said<font color="#CCCCCC"> it yes learn</font>

34
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,950
 fast I like the way you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think and</font>

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,470
so one of the things is I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

36
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,360
infosec industry for a long time for

37
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,360
well over a decade we'll leave it at

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,370
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a more senior person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to my</font>

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,350
job many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times I get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that are</font>

40
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,750
just breaking into security coming and

41
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,360
talking to me say hey listen I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font>

42
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,820
field now I want to break into security

43
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,310
and so I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself being a mentor to</font>

44
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,679
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> students to these junior people</font>

45
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,330
and telling them things and invariably

46
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,659
one of the questions that they'll ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

47
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,700
is well my gut how do you infosec what

48
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,879
do you do with in information security

49
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could also do so that I can get</font>

50
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to some of the places that you've been</font>

51
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:28,069
and my suggestion of thumb is is really

52
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">not to get to the same place as I've</font>

53
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:31,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">been in infosec it really is a choose</font>

54
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,769
your own adventure and there's no right

55
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,929
path it's ever it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever makes you</font>

56
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:38,420
happy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

57
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:41,180
there's a distinct difference between

58
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,429
the infosec industry and the infosec

59
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,500
community the community is what we have

60
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">here this is you know people spending</font>

61
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,930
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> fridays getting their learning on</font>

62
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:53,360
breaking stuff building stuff

63
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:57,940
communicating industry i would i would

64
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:01,010
venture to say is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more a lot more</font>

65
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:05,390
industrial it's a lot more sterile in

66
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:07,700
many places um so if you've been in the

67
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,670
industry for a while you'll understand

68
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">that as far as the amount of information</font>

69
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,890
that there is an information security

70
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:17,750
it's a mile wide and it really is not an

71
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,179
inch deep as some tests will tell you

72
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,849
it's an amazing amount of information

73
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,769
and it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be truly overwhelming to</font>

74
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:26,810
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> just getting started well do I</font>

75
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:30,849
start as a forensics person or a policy

76
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:33,889
person or or programmer I don't know so

77
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:37,130
within this<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you</font>

79
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:42,650
or 12 but I just I had to have 13 for

80
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,700
some reason um different<font color="#E5E5E5"> tips to join</font>

81
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,980
the information security community

82
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,638
because I'll tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you this since I did</font>

83
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,798
this many<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago my work has been</font>

84
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:53,750
better my<font color="#E5E5E5"> connections to the community</font>

85
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,959
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been better and ultimately I've</font>

86
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,669
gotten a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of new friends so</font>

87
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,739
here's my tips number one somebody said

88
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:03,260
it get experience thank you sir it's

89
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:04,579
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I asked you to say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

90
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,440
experience and this is one of those

91
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:07,760
double-edged swords right hey I'm a

92
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,319
newbie I'm going to break in what do I

93
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,108
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break in you need experience hey</font>

94
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,760
I'm a newbie I want to break<font color="#CCCCCC"> no so there</font>

95
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:18,109
are places that you can go to get

96
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:21,798
experience right in infosec we have kind

97
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:26,090
of a pyramidal pyramidal appointed type

98
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:28,400
of approach here in my opinion we have a

99
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,650
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of computer experience</font>

100
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,349
whether it's hey I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good with</font>

101
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:35,960
modding my phone or I'll of hacking

102
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:39,080
websites or I love just learning of

103
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">Krypto there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of this base</font>

104
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,990
experience that if you have or you get

105
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:47,150
it will help you when you reach that hey

106
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,849
now I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec that's</font>

107
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:52,429
kind of where I came from the trick is

108
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:54,680
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> once you do get into infosec you</font>

109
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,780
realize there's a whole new pyramid way

110
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,889
above you with forensics and policy in

111
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:03,318
all these other areas so as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

112
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:05,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're still always learning you're</font>

113
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:09,680
gonna realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

114
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:12,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">more to learn myself I started out</font>

115
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,340
learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> on these things yeah I see some</font>

116
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,530
of you in the audience not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your head</font>

117

00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:21,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">blue got me some pitfall um and an apple</font>

119
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,739
and then you know what I started playing

120
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:27,830

121
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,840

123
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,650
NT forced mcse<font color="#E5E5E5"> I felt powerful I not</font>

124
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,940
only could use the computers but I'd

125
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,380
understood it a little bit how they

126
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,599
worked how they talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to each other</font>

127
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,240
that's that base level experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

128
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:46,370
understanding how things work and that

129

people if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're coming from an academic</font>

161
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,940

teach<font color="#CCCCCC"> me how to program or how to</font>

166
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">infosec just some degree that may be the</font>

167
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,900
case but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that class</font>

168
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,240
that your boss wants you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to may</font>

169
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,880
not be what you want to do in infosec

170
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a lot of resources out there on</font>

171
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,800
in the in the world now there's this

172
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:30,710
thing called a<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube anybody you yeah</font>

173
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay CTFs how many people are doing CTF</font>

174
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,700
downstairs how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have heard</font>

175
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,010
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is the CTF down stick okay</font>

176
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,599
some hands go up good good<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you're</font>

177
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">choosing not to do it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's your</font>

178
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,830
option and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that brings up a great point</font>

179
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,840
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the things I've talked about</font>

180
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,669
here you don't have to do all of them to

181
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,909
feel better connected to the environment

182
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:53,660
better connected to the community but

183
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:56,330
choose one choose to participate your

184
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,190
your experience will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot richer um</font>

185
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:01,039
the other thing that you can do is read

186
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:03,290
wiki's and blogs and forums the neat

187
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,210
things about what is being published to

188
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:08,390
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet is that there's so many</font>

189
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,159
niche areas hey I I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one</font>

190
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:13,099
vulnerability or oh I want to research

191
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,470
this one thing or I wonder if that if

192
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:18,350
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it and it's already on the end</font>

193
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,330
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet and there's probably a</font>

194
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:25,250
video about it which is maybe not safe

195
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:27,590
at work so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far as self learning take</font>

196
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,270
control over your education take<font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

197
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,280
over what you're learning some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

198
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,870
already do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this you go to work you work</font>

199
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,640
nine to five or your work nine to nine

200
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,830
or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and then you go home</font>

201
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you continue your learning let me go</font>

202
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,240
ahead and code up that thing for for

203
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:44,530
myself to understand what's going on do

204
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more connected I</font>

205
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:50,839
myself chose to go the route of sands I

206
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:53,150
took a sans class a sans institute class

207
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,280
outside this is cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a company</font>

208
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:57,079
that will that will give me learning

209
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,060
they will force-feed me literally it's

210
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,040
like drinking from anybody taking a sans

211
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,439
class yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like drinking from a</font>

212
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,180
fire hose right i mean they just pour

213
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,690
information into you and the people are

214
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:11,569
so nice and afterwards your brain is

215
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:13,160
kind of overflowing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was like i</font>

216
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,710
could do some of these things back on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

217
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,020
home network so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was assist admin and i</font>

218
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,700
went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these sands classes and i</font>

219
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,850
learned how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do stuff I learned how to</font>

220
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,770
use certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> tools and went back to my</font>

221
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,720
environment I'm like hey boss I bet I

222
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,460
could hack into our super secret system

223
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,440
that we've got going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here he's like</font>

224
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,930
no you're not gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it in production</font>

225
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,020
it's like I i will make<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i had</font>

226
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:38,000
that foundation like I would make a

227
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:40,939
replica of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our system will call it dev</font>

228
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,430
test exploit whatever and I'll hack on

229
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,950
that and within I took the skills that I

230
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:49,130
had that I learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this class and I</font>

365
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,540
really neat we would go to these

366
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:37,790
meetings and there would be people have

367
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,079
a wide variety of skill level in there

368

438
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:31,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it seems simple right I bet over</font>

439
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:33,799
half of you have used an open source

440
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:36,738
project at one time of your life whether

441

it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit or or some other tool</font>

442
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:43,999
yeah these things are easy I<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself I</font>

443
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:47,720
learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python and I started coding very</font>

444
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:49,820
very poorly but I started coding in in a

445
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,679
recon ng framework I started writing

446
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,928
these modules because it was about

447
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,899
scraping information off of websites and

448
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:58,489
then writing a module to do that more

449
00:18:56,899 --> 00:19:00,559
efficiently and put it within this

450
00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:02,779
framework it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool and it</font>

451
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,418
mixed my work life with what my

452
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:08,330
information security community life was

453
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:10,249
becoming so I had motivation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

454
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,949
knowledge and I could do<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things</font>

455
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:15,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">and learn a new skill which was good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

456
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:18,919
me so this was fun and it was neither

457
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:21,499

469
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:51,049
he did is instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixing my code he</font>

470
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,740
taught me<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to fix the code he taught</font>

498
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:04,639
they'll they'll figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answers</font>

499
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:08,330
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then those questions won't be good</font>

organizes and categorized open-source

516
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:50,959
intelligence-gathering tools okay we

517
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:52,309
call them stalking tools but in

518
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,929
information security there are

519
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:56,869
open-source intelligence-gathering tools

520
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:59,359
but all it is is you go out and you find

521
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:01,728
a site that you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up somebody's</font>

522
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,559
phone number on you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the project</font>

Pickers tool tool us some firewalls will

00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:12,749
block this if you're in a corporate

553
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,579
environment they call this a hacking

554

00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,649
ones that's okay and we called the

574
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,839

people's screens I'm like I could

610
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:25,320
probably do that I could probably do

611
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:27,510
that I don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put my laptop on</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network that's too scary for me and</font>

613
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:32,850
I wasn't at a place where I could do

614
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:34,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's okay that was where I was at</font>

615
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:36,510
at that time but you know what the next

616
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,250
year I made a goal and my goal was to

617
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:40,408
sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and just do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a little bit</font>

618
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:43,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">until I stopped getting bored you know I</font>

00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:50,669
be careful about that black key to

622
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:53,850
everything clean kali linux install and

623
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:57,179
I hopped on the network and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I SAT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

624
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:59,070
from friday at noon until sunday at noon

625
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:00,809

626
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,760
can't my team came in<font color="#E5E5E5"> third that year</font>

627
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,649
was awesome and I learned so much

628
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,360
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I worked with a bunch of other</font>

629
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:08,908
people and those people became my

630
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,860
friends and those friends knew more

631
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:12,059
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows exploitation than I could</font>

632
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,979
ever know but you know what I knew a

633
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:15,600
little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about web so when they</font>

634
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,580
got to a hard website or something like

635
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,260
that like a mica can you help me<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and</font>

00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">like yeah but you got to help me with</font>

637
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,549
this because I don't and we work

638
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:26,668
together towards a common goal and we

639
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:29,879
learned so Mike my challenge to you is

640
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:32,970
is if you want to go down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the CTF</font>

641
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,130
downstairs try one of them try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lock</font>

642
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,930
pick which you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to plug in the</font>

643
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,850
computer to do I get that

644
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:40,980
but try something downstairs that you

645
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:42,840
haven't done in the past to broaden your

646
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,720
horizons you might find that you've got

647
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:48,419
some skills<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you didn't know about</font>

648
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:52,440
so we did the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CTF and that was cool Mike</font>

649
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:55,230
tip number<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven is to publish your</font>

662
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,879
public notes so that when I go and I

it's on the youtubes and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

727
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:01,800
finding people on the internet and

728
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,649
showing you know where they live and

729
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:07,110
other things it's kind of fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

730
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:08,400
afterward this lady can raise their hand

731
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:11,399
outside get there any questions she

732
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,410
raised her hands she said yeah so why

733
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">were all of your examples about women</font>

734
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:17,970
you had three examples and all of them

735
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:22,860
were about women what why don't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

736
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:25,200
women<font color="#E5E5E5"> Micah like my I love my wife I</font>

737
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:28,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a daughter I love my mom I like</font>

738
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,140
women and but it got me thinking I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

739
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:34,470
her point was was more that she had an

740
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:36,390
agenda she she had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a feminist blog and</font>

741
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:38,250
she was you know talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

742
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:40,710
indignities if I had three men<font color="#E5E5E5"> up there</font>

743
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:43,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">as examples the same question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would have</font>

744
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:48,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">come out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of her mouth but I took the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eye</font>

745
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:50,280
i took<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> essence of what she said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

746
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:53,250
my examples even though they were easy

747
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:55,530
and they fit<font color="#E5E5E5"> were skewed and I opened up</font>

748
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,300
myself I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> well could I make one of</font>

749
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,860
them about a man and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font>

750
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,659
went back home and my daughter helped me

751
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">out with that talk and she and I went</font>

752
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,679
scouring the internet for places where

753
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:08,129
men were disclosing too much information

754
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:10,679
which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of places and we we</font>

755
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:14,219
actually found a better example for my

756
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:16,139
talk then that that woman example so it

757
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:19,039
was good so so taking that feedback and

758
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:21,840
being open to it allowed me to actually

759
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,389
make a better presentation that was

760
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,928
pretty cool and actually then blogged

761
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:29,789
about that thanking her for doing that I

762
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:32,879
think she wrote a blog criticizing my

763
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:36,240
blog about her blog so it's one of these

764
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:38,580
inception thing the next thing is share

765
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">your knowledge now when I talked to</font>

766
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,549
junior people about this people were

767
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:43,110
just breaking into security and say

768
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:48,269
share your<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge they're like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whoa</font>

769
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:50,820
no no I I'm not here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just getting</font>

770
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:52,860
in there I say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what there's</font>

771
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:56,009
things that you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

772
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:58,498
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't looked into DNS SEC or</font>

773
00:31:56,009 --> 00:32:01,590
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't tried to figure out how to use</font>

774
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:03,119
ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you have to do this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in class</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

775
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:05,879
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to do something else with</font>

776
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:09,119
object-oriented programming I don't know

777
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:10,799
so you even though you're junior you

778
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:13,009
have other skills that you can bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

779
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:17,789
bear to further the conversation and

780
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:20,070
share your knowledge now for me I set a

781
00:32:17,789 --> 00:32:22,830
goal of becoming a sans instructor I

782
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:26,309
teach<font color="#CCCCCC"> for sands now but it took me years</font>

783
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:27,539
to actually work up to that but that was

784
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:29,908
a goal that's how I share information

785
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:31,289
you might not want to do this standing

786
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:34,379
in front of groups like this might

787
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:35,970
terrify you and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

788
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:39,178
other ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can contribute</font>

789
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:42,659
whether it's at work in a brown bag or

790
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:45,360
or doing an after our talk at a college

791
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:47,429
class or after a<font color="#E5E5E5"> college class or</font>

792
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,820
something you can mentor other people

793
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:52,230
help them bring them along into your

794
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,850
journey hey you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font>

795
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:57,149
choosing to do I went to this talk there

796
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:59,279
were 13 tips not 14 not 12 13 tips and

797
00:32:57,149 --> 00:33:01,258
I'm choosing<font color="#CCCCCC"> these three which are you</font>

798
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:05,789
going to do and you kind of learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

799
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:10,169
each other this is another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

800
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:14,070
find as it is one that sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple but</font>

801
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:16,799
it eludes us because we don't think

802
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:17,730
about our journey we think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

803
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,220
destination

804
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:22,260
you set a<font color="#CCCCCC"> goal you like I want to you</font>

805
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:26,130

808
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:36,930
the early 1990s um these things were how

809
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:39,890
we like kept track of our calendars

810
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:41,910
there was no Google's there was no no

811
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,890
nothing to keep track<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it on the</font>

812
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:45,060
computer so we used these books and you

813
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:46,920
know what these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are ones that are in my</font>

818
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:59,310
where you've been and it allows you to

819
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:01,020
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that growth because what we don't</font>

822
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,460

826
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,830
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to that event and by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

827
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,420
that sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're feeling down</font>

00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:44,940
a runner and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> year for her birthday I</font>

839
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,190
got her one of these running things it

840
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:49,830
says success isn't how far you got but

841
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:52,620
the distance<font color="#E5E5E5"> you traveled from where you</font>

842
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:55,679
started and I started thinking like I

843
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:57,390
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been collecting all the badges from</font>

844
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,890
all of the trainings I've gone to from

845
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:01,170
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conferences I've gone to and</font>

846
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:03,720
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just hanging in my closet well</font>

847
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:06,630
heck that's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money and a lot of</font>

848
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:09,149
time and a lot of effort that normally

849
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:11,700
people don't see that I've put in to get

850
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:13,500
where I am and so what I did was I

851
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,750
bought one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things off of the</font>

852
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,700
running on the wall or Amazon<font color="#CCCCCC"> wherever</font>

853
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:20,130
and I hung on my stuff and I put it on

854
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,930

00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:11,720
our lives just like we do at work making

874
