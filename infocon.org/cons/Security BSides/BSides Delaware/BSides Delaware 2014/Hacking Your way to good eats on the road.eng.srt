thing standard disclaimer as given<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,230

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:25,289
myself not my employer anybody else do

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,539
with it as you may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own risk if</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't think there's kind of anything</font>

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,449
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to get you into</font>

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,809
trouble here but might as well give<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

12
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:37,440
standard disclaimer so jumping right

13
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:40,078
into it why on earth would you want to

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,379
make life a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more difficult</font>

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,390
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself and try to upend the way</font>

16
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,789
most people go about getting food on the

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,840
road there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of major reasons</font>

18
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:54,480
why I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think first is quality if you are</font>

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,460
a foodie of by your own definition

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,648
whatever that may be if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't</font>

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">like getting whatever random fast food</font>

22
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,320
you run<font color="#E5E5E5"> into you know this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a way to</font>

23
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,460
control that and get something that's

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be better second reason is</font>

25
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:13,048
control whether it's a dietary

26
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,179
restriction or anything else for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

27
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,820
personally keeping kosher because I do

28
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,400
keep kosher that was a major motivation

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,158
for me to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of delve into things and</font>

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,740
find alternative ways to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

31
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:30,630
that was better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than let's say a power</font>

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:33,390
bar and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Red Bull going to vegas</font>

33
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,630
for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> week you know you're if you're</font>

34
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,270
stuck in a in and around to hotel you're

35
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:44,158
going to want to kind of you know mix it

36
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:48,600
up a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least another reason</font>

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,960
is savings not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily the most</font>

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,270
major thing but if you're eating out if

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,969
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> forgo let's say fast food and are</font>

40
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,100
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a nice restaurant that's going</font>

41
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start to add up real</font>

42
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">quick if you're on vacation so you can</font>

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">get that quality but you're going to</font>

44
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:07,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">sacrifice something that turns the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font>

45
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:09,169
and the last one is convenience and

46
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:12,530
although it's it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to depend on</font>

47
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:14,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">the individual but I believe if I'm on a</font>

48
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,520
vacation or at a conference or something

49
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:19,280
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to drag out to</font>

50
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,930
somewhere off-site if I you know at the

51
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,940
end of the day or in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of the</font>

52
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,250
day in<font color="#CCCCCC"> between sessions I'd like the</font>

53
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability to run back somewhere quickly</font>

54
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,500
grab a bite to have it be something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

55
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:37,130
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually enjoy and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then move on</font>

56
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:38,480
with my day so in terms of what we're

57
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,579
going to do and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going to</font>

58
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,980
accomplish it first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if in</font>

59
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:46,160
any situation is think ahead first

60
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,988
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what can I bring with me if</font>

61
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,319
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> flying obviously you need things</font>

62
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:53,630
that RTS a friendly thinking about

63
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:56,268
things that are as simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> as let's take</font>

64
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:58,100
a pouch of tuna fish versus a can of

65
00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:00,319
tuna<font color="#E5E5E5"> fish that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> solves a couple of</font>

66
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,840
different problems one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we don't need</font>

67
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,958
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> break necessarily a can opener the</font>

68
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,549
other thing is it is I don't believe

69
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's going to be a problem in terms of</font>

70
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:12,440
liquids and bringing back through TSA so

71
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:17,268
just kind of thinking about things in

72
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:19,640
general like that can help you along if

73
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:20,570
you are traveling and you have to go and

74
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">your take a flight enough to go through</font>

75
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:26,510
TSA maybe you might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider</font>

76
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,950
replacing the couple ounces that you

77
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:31,090
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have that's going to reserve</font>

78
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:33,170
for things like shampoo with sriracha or

79
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">barbecue sauce or something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font>

80
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,100
take those same little bottles put

81
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">something in there that you can use to</font>

82
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,329
augment whatever else you're bringing

83
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:43,070
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really improve something</font>

84
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:44,660
that may have been you know even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

85
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,060
you're buying it from a mobile source

86
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:51,019
bring up a little bit of flavor bringing

87
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,519
spices and anything else might also want

88
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:54,380
to bring me some camping items

89
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,090
traditionally<font color="#CCCCCC"> used for Kathy that pack</font>

90
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,040
up small<font color="#E5E5E5"> their light they'll fit in</font>

91
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,260
there as<font color="#CCCCCC"> long as you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not dealing with</font>

92
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,760
you know some knives or anything should

93
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,608
be able to bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> that again on a plane</font>

94
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,548
without problem what<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bring</font>

95
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:09,379
with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's going to be a lot in</font>

96
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:12,319
any situation you can't bring your

97
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:14,720
entire kitchen with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you but even just</font>

98
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,238
knowing what things you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

99
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,750
missing can help you along the way and

100
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:22,489
just plan it out ahead of time when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

101
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:27,289
go to choose where you're going to stay

102
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:29,840
so I say choose your lodgings wise going

103
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:31,759
ahead and making sure it has a hotel if

104
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,530
you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> a motel will have a little</font>

105
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,699
fridge that goes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long way you can</font>

106
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,789
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring either print stuff with</font>

107
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:39,979
you buy stuff there keep long-term they

108
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:41,960
may have other amenities whether in the

109
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:44,000
rumor that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> call up to delve a</font>

110
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,460
little deeper you can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,740
times there's stuff that you would not

112
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,719
necessarily imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they have in</font>

113
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,979
most hotels that if you just call up and

114
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,870
ask you know you get things like

115
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:56,810
microwaves pretty easily out a lot of

116
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,660
hotels and you may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about</font>

117
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,030
choosing something other than hotel

118
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:04,520
Airbnb not just for cost savings or

119
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:06,020
anything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> but was well most the time</font>

120
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,930
they'll be a kitchen and that will be

121
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,690
stopped with things like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know just</font>

122
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,789
condiments and general utensils and

123
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:18,710
other things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage</font>

124
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:21,199
of another option is ship stuff out

125
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,570
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you pack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it up ship it to where</font>

126
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,650
you're going to be or just buy stuff on

127
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">Amazon and have it shipped directly</font>

128
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:29,570
there that goes for a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of small</font>

129
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,340
items things you might be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick</font>

130
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,139
up at a convenience store that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be a</font>

131
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,479
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more expensive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're a lot</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">more expensive they're violent amazon if</font>

135
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,400
potentially you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

the ground hotel amenities they can be

twine gets get some shower caps and use

145
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:12,820
them to the to hold things kind of think

146
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:15,340
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in not just the traditional</font>

147
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,770
amenities that they have but what else

they can be used for there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

149
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,789
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they offer in hotels and in</font>

150
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:26,350
other places<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can really take</font>

you catch me out there some happy go

153
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,909
into detail about different things that

154
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,980
you can get just by being nice and you

155
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,660
know social engineering your way into an

156
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,030
event venue whether it's a conference

157

00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,970
help people so you can use that

161
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,050
tremendously to your advantage just

162
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,700
think about the social engineering

163
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,890
aspect of it a little bit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll</font>

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,350
that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of situation your cup of</font>

179
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,990
bar it's it's not necessarily going to

180
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,310
be the most traditional thing that

181
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,230
they're asked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you go down to</font>

bar and ask them for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know when to</font>

183
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,110
lemon they're probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to oblige</font>

184
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,370
they probably also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple other</font>

185
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,250
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might be able to grab</font>

186
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,969
their coffee shops as well often have

187
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,129
utensil

188
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:47,379
you don't have utensils might be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

189
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:50,679
scrounge things just by whatever's

190
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:52,329
around convenience stores<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollar source</font>

191
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,679
if you're going for longer periods of

192
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:56,229
time don't want to bring a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

193
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:58,479
stuff with you stop by again I've done

194
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:59,889
this in vegas instead of loading up my

195
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,469
bag of old stuff i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> youth of</font>

196
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:05,679
the week take a cab or rent a car go to

197
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:07,029
the dollar store for 10 15 bucks you can

198
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:08,828
load up on everything you're never going

199
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:14,049
to need that's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be disposable</font>

200
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:17,739
items etc so one thing I've tried to do

201
00:08:14,049 --> 00:08:20,709
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past few years is kind of</font>

202
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:22,989
condense everything down into a kit that

203
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:24,759
i can bring along with<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and have it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

204
00:08:22,989 --> 00:08:26,498
its own self sufficient thing it's kind

205
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:28,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">of like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know pen testers back of</font>

206
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:30,539
doom or a briefcase of doom or whatever

207
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:34,810
backpack of tune you're going to pull it

208
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:37,838
take the same idea and apply it here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font>

209
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:40,539
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have separate bag self-contained</font>

210
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,610
I want to keep it going back and forth a

211
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:44,709
bit over the years but now I try to keep

212
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">it separate from my normal carry-on bag</font>

213
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:48,518
I don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to check things at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all but</font>

214
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,949
I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have something that will fit</font>

215
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:52,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">onto the seeds that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can put all of the</font>

216
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:54,089
food that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring along if</font>

217
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's dry goods or anything else and</font>

218
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:59,170
anything cooking apparatus or anything

219
00:08:56,199 --> 00:09:00,878
else in that one bet that helps<font color="#CCCCCC"> me grab</font>

220
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,829
it and go if I need to it also helps

221
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:06,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep it separate if anything spills out</font>

222
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:08,469
or anything like that in that bag I want

223
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:10,599
to take I don't want to take everything

224
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want it takes the hard to find stuff</font>

225
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,480
if there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be particular</font>

226
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:19,209
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to be able to find special</font>

227
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,730
sauces and maybe even something like

228
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:23,529
olive oil extra virgin olive oil or some

229
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,300
like that you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find some pepper</font>

230
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:27,939
but finally Oh stuff is gonna be harder

231
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,639
so it might put that in there try to

232
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,529
make stuff that shelf stable with that

233
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:34,510
smaller versions of tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you</font>

234
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:37,360
are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily going to need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

235
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,980
I've found that I've started to acquire

236
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,870
you know kind of you know travel

237
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,490
versions or smaller versions of tools

238
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:45,519
not that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need them in every</font>

239
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:48,279
single situation but having them there

240
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,839
means okay it's in my bag I know I'm not

241
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,510
going to have to even worry about it

242
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,250
always there to always ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go one</font>

243
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,980
time I spent like an hour and a half in

244
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,110
a major casino looking for a corkscrew

245
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,160
and instead of that point forward just

246
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,199
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to bother</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with that</font>

247
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,660
anymore actually one thing to keep in

248
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:06,609
mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of something like a corkscrew you</font>

249
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,310
can bring it on an airplane but you

250
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,720
can't bring a standard corkscrew because

251
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,000
it has that<font color="#CCCCCC"> little blade that acts as</font>

252
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,370
the foil cutter but if you go to a lot

253
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">of places like go to walgreens you can</font>

254
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:21,550
find a little collapsible corkscrew it's

255
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:24,420
like three bucks i think specialty items

256
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:27,099
if you have I don't know

257
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,019
particular things uncommon tools that

258
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,480
you're gonna that you might want to use

259
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:33,790
could go into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit later on but</font>

260
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,040
the sous-vide machine God sitting over

263
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:43,389
that's something that I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

264
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:45,100
going to buy it there i'm not going to

265
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:46,989
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there it's just not going to be</font>

266
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:51,369
there so that obviously has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

267

that is about half the height of the

272
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,129
global carry-on bag and it will actually

273
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:12,489
fit under an airplane seat so you can

274
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:17,199
carry a lot in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there that is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i like</font>

bashes type it out if you cut the corner

327
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:23,980
off do a lot of interesting stuff just

328
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:28,209
with the bags themselves and they'll be

329

useful we get to assume feeding can't

330
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:33,099
bring a knife on a plane but I believe

331
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,930
it I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tested it but I have heard</font>

that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily bring a lettuce</font>

knife lettuce knife is all plastic so

334
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:43,149
it's not metal and therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

espresso tea you basically put a filter

in the bottom here put your grounds and

down on the plunger and it pushes the

you'll actually get coffee out of that

00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:32,079
it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be less acidic and it'll be you</font>

374
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:34,869
know for some people that is the primary

375
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,870
purpose why they will go for a cold brew

376
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:40,060
but it will also<font color="#E5E5E5"> be just a simple simple</font>

377
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,050
way in a very compact way because I

378
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,119
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole thing the whole</font>

381
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:50,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">very compactly and you know</font>

stick some some grounds in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> body of</font>

00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:58,840
it and get yourself a really really good

machines anybody here here are<font color="#CCCCCC"> soothing</font>

386

machines know what they are and if I

387
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:10,540
understand the principles involved now

388
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:12,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay subang machines are one of these</font>

390
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,560
these chef competition shows they it's

391
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:20,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">billed as this really really fancy way</font>

392
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:25,170
of cooking meats and vegetables and

393
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:30,160
other things perfectly the basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is</font>

394
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:32,410
this machine just<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a little loaf and</font>

395
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,689
that's using to circulate water and it

396
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:37,870
has a coil that uses to heat up that

397
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:39,850
water so it keeps water at a constant

398
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,890
temperature and then you place items in

399
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:44,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">that water</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they will poke to that</font>

400
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:47,530
exact temperature so you can precisely

401
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:49,120
define exactly where you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cook an</font>

cooking something you put it in pan that

404
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,819
pan is getting up well above what the

00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,890
temperature<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're looking to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cook</font>

putting it on waiting until it's enough

408
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,550
time has passed so that the inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

steak has heated up to the right point

410
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,579
and then you'll flip it and the other

411
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,869
side so it gets all the way to the

412
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:10,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">middle and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you pull it off before</font>

it overcooks but this you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

414
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:15,040
worry about it you've just<font color="#CCCCCC"> put it in and</font>

415

we'll cook to that temperature<font color="#CCCCCC"> sous vide</font>

recipes wrigley will have the target

temperature and a maximum time at a

longer than 12 hours and that's

something I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could really use</font>

00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:32,330
to your advantage if we're cooking in a

423
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,490
place where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have the tradition</font>

424
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:40,610
kitchen it's right now my preferred

425
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:42,590
method of cooking so in terms of what

426
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,860
the difference is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the items in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

427
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:47,779
coat so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is from the bottom that</font>

428
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,689
I've here and the one I like right now

429
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:53,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">sancerre this is on their website they</font>

430
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:56,120
have kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of meat cook the traditional</font>

431
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,340
leg meat cooked soupy so you can see

432
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay because we put it on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heat get a</font>

433
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:03,199
little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> great band there and then</font>

434
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,480
we have the nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> center this cooks all</font>

435
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,230
the way through that's great it's

436
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,809
fantastic<font color="#E5E5E5"> food but the cool thing is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

437
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:13,460
don't have to worry about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you</font>

438
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:16,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have to bring it up to temp you</font>

439
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:20,330
could leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it going the whole day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

440
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:22,639
we got to figure out though how do how

441
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:24,860
do we get that to a point where I can

442
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:27,620
use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a rumor I don't really have</font>

443
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">much else traditionally suvi what you do</font>

444
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:35,510
is you vacuum seal the food before you

445
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:38,090
put it in so if we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bother</font>

446
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:40,340
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it how are we going to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

447
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:42,620
that well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> sous vide machines have</font>

448
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,970
become more mainstream a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

449
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,510
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been playing around with different</font>

450
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:49,519
ways to to cook things and avoid using a

451
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:51,110
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> commercial vacuum sealer or</font>

452
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,690
even a home vacuum sealer<font color="#E5E5E5"> on very</font>

453
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,639
compact first thing most people do when

454
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:58,130
they get a sous-vide machine is cook

455
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:59,658
eggs obviously you got eggs you don't

456
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:02,360
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to vacuum silicon already is</font>

457
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:03,950
contained in the shell throw it in set

458
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,519
the temperature your egg will be cooked

459
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:09,110
absolutely perfectly every single time

460
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,630
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can leave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in there for a couple</font>

461
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,668
hours if you like eggs great that's you

462
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">know you want to XXL whatever that could</font>

463
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:17,029
take you a long distance you can even

464
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,250
potentially start it off in the morning

465
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:19,950
have a soft-boiled egg turn up the

466
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">temperature</font>

467
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:27,210
bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then get your hard-boiled eggs</font>

468
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:29,549
for lunch if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

469
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:32,070
commercial vacuum sealer or or home

470
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:35,190
vacuum sealer we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use water</font>

471
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:37,649
displacement to vacuum-seal items that

472
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:40,200
were gonna put into this water bath all

473
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:42,539
you have to do is handy zip top bag put

474
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,820
your protein in the center add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

475
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:46,559
bit of oil or anything just offset some

476
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,950
pockets that might be there or even

477
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,299
don't put it into water as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you put it</font>

478
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,240
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the water the water is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

479
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:57,450
displace the air if you bring the lip of

480
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,549
the bag down to the water level you'll

481
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,620
actually squeeze out all the air and you

482
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:03,629
always have at the top of Babel a little

483
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,969
bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> extra room so you can seal it up</font>

484
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:08,580
get something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're not</font>

485
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,649
perfectly vacuum sealed but definitely

486
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:14,460
vacuum-sealed enough for our purposes

487
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:19,229
and then you can leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bath to</font>

488
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:22,350
cook so this i have used on a number of

489
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:26,130
occasions I've done big cuts of meat of

490
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:28,500
this past summer I actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> death</font>

491
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:31,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">calm want to go to toxic BBQ want to</font>

492
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,809
bring some<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff there I took a bunch of</font>

493
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:36,689
ribs and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> cooked them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for 48 hours</font>

494
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:39,629
leading up to the BBQ wrapped it with me

495
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:42,120
went out and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just there and ready</font>

496
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:44,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go in terms of what you need to</font>

497
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:49,168
actually put on this stuff this is

498
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:50,390
stupid simple cooking the this is I

499
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:53,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">think from America</font>

500
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:55,550
test kitchen or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something they're just</font>

501
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,680
doing I think salmon with some oil and

502
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:59,210
maybe an herb in there and that's it

503
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,860
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing else that they're</font>

504
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:03,320
putting in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm making a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> row so</font>

505
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll put some salt pepper maybe one or</font>

506
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,720
two other things I'll throw it in the

507
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:12,560
bag and<font color="#CCCCCC"> equal takase amazing because the</font>

508
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,840
meat itself is cooked perfectly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I made</font>

509
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,540
ribs all identities take the ribs add a

510
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,179
tiny bit of barbecue sauce throw it in

511
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:22,399
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sit for two days let it sit for</font>

512
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:25,250
three days let sit for one day you're

513
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,530
getting if you don't have a ton of

514
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:30,380
equipment you can substitute<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and</font>

515
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:33,230
add a little bit of extra<font color="#CCCCCC"> time that is</font>

516
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:34,820
not active time this is all passive

517
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:37,580
you're setting it up and then just

518
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:40,689
letting it go and you get some fantastic

519
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:43,010
fantastic stuff this doesn't mean to be

520
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:45,500
highfalutin stuff this is something

521
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:48,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's easy to accomplish and easy to</font>

522
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:51,290
take with you one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that isn't</font>

523
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:53,080
compact though is the vessel<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

524
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:55,610
they're using one of these

525
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,740
polycarbonates things that you'll find

526
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,620
enough and of restaurants are in a big

527
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:03,080
kitchen it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really that compact and</font>

528
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,939
can't easily bring it on a plane throw

529
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,350
it in the back of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a car easily pick able</font>

530
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,140
to bring it on plane so what do you do

531
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:11,570
for that what I've been doing is getting

532
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:13,790
a five gallon bucket stop by home depot

533
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,820
they're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 23 bucks you're staying</font>

534
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:19,370
somewhere go to go to any restaurants or

535
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,990
kitchen or anything everything comes in

536
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">5 gallon buckets and commercial settings</font>

537
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,920
I'm sure you could scavenge a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5-gallon</font>

538
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,780
bucket but if you really really can't

539
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,750
it's two or three bucks at Home Depot

540
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,730
and get a lift from Home Depot also kind

541
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:35,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">of hold it if you really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to go</font>

542
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:36,660
so that you know again that's knowing

543
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,400
ahead of time I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need it not</font>

544
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,730
going to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with me but it's super</font>

545
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,160
easy to source once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get on the ground</font>

546
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:45,950
I've been playing around with trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

547
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,840
find something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i can bring with me</font>

548
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,760
my currents thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm actually have in</font>

549
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,389
my bag right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now testing out this</font>

550
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:56,340
weekend it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cami bucket this guy is</font>

551
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:59,280
designed to hold water on its own and

552
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,809
stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> upright I'm not quite so sure how</font>

553
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,760
it's going to work out for me when I

554
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:04,830
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to throw the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sous vide machine in</font>

555
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,080
it but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a situation where I might</font>

556
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,909
use a combination of this bucket which

557
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,280
will stand up on its own and will hold

558
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:14,670
the water along with us and gaffers tape

559
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,350
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> some twine or something else to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

560
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:19,200
fix Mississippi machine so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know will</font>

561
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:21,870
tip over<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it in place use the bucket</font>

562
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,860

<font color="#E5E5E5">everything I've read about at this</font>

564
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,780
bucket can stand up to some pretty high

565
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,428
temperatures<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're not going to hit</font>

566
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,200
those high temperatures when we're

567
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:33,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking to sous-vide items we're going</font>

570
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:41,220
earlier Tim Ferriss has a thing about

571
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:44,160
cooking salmon in a hotel sink where he

572
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:46,290
does water displacement to seal salmon

573
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,870
in a bag and then uses just the tap

574
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:51,750
water at its highest setting in a hotel

575
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:54,689
bathroom to cook salmon that's really on

576
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,740
the edge it's it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the lower</font>

577
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,929
edge of what you're going to want to

578
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:00,510
cook it<font color="#E5E5E5"> too but this isn't going this is</font>

00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:02,809
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know 10 degrees 15 degrees</font>

581
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:08,040
you know tremendous temperatures and

582
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:10,140
this stuff is designed to be you know

583
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,149
sanitized<font color="#E5E5E5"> but throwing boiling water and</font>

584
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:14,820
bleach in it so it'll stand up to a fair

585
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:17,760
amount of abuse I don't know / 24-48

587
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,470
know certainly for 68 hours of time I

588
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:25,010
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

589
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,010
pretty good

590
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:30,840
if you're not interested in investing in

591
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:33,149
something like a sous-vide machine so

592
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,119
these machines right now start at about

593
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:38,488
<font color="#CCCCCC">150 200 dollars so it's a little bit of</font>

594
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:40,978
an investment you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get fantastic stuff</font>

595
00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:42,629
both on the road and at home but it is a

596
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,489
little bit of investment you want to go

597
00:24:42,629 --> 00:24:46,350
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a cheap around a little</font>

598
00:24:44,489 --> 00:24:50,129
bit of a cheaper route pick up a rice

599
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:52,619
maker rice makers are super super cheap

600
00:24:50,129 --> 00:24:54,869
you go to a walgreens or CVS or

601
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:56,759
something like that buy one for 10 15

602
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:58,859
bucks they usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> come with a steamer</font>

603
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:00,929
basket that will sit on top never use a

604
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:03,418
rice maker all you got to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rice</font>

605
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:06,059
on the bottom add some water push the

606
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:07,950
button<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's done you can go ahead</font>

607
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:09,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">get some frozen vegetables put them to</font>

608
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:12,210
give the seamer basket on top you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

609
00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:14,609
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of stuff coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down from</font>

610
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,649
the vegetables as they<font color="#CCCCCC"> steam get that</font>

611
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:18,418
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rice you can bring some</font>

612
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:21,629
sometimes I brought like a hard salami

613
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:23,129
in my bag and<font color="#E5E5E5"> take so limitless awesome</font>

614
00:25:21,629 --> 00:25:24,809
hard salami or something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

615
00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:27,149
vegetable sleeping on the top you get a

616
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:28,889
whole meal going and you're out a couple

617
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:30,748
bucks if you decide to leave that rice

618
00:25:28,889 --> 00:25:32,428
paper there but if you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> vest</font>

619
00:25:30,749 --> 00:25:34,889
anything else you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just buy a small of</font>

620
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:36,989
rice maker throw it in your bag bring it

621
00:25:34,889 --> 00:25:38,849
along with you and you can cook a whole

622
00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:41,429
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way it can't cook</font>

623
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:43,710
things like pastas but you know if you

624
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:45,749
want it to go again with super cheap

625
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,849
super simple stuff it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not necessary</font>

626
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:50,239
the healthiest but those box rice

627
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:52,799
tissues or side dishes and stuff

628
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:55,080
anything that's kind of just bring to a

629
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:58,039
boil you can throw in one of these and

630
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,710
it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> cook it and you'll be good to go</font>

631
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:05,519
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wanted to go a little bit more</font>

632
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:08,009
traditional but go very versatile and

633
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,970
get an induction cooktop a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

634
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:14,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">are familiar with kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your standard</font>

635
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:16,590
coil metal coil little burners those

636
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:19,619
electric ones those electric burners

637
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:21,749
don't necessarily transfer a lot of heat

638
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:23,759
to a pan makes a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit difficult to</font>

639
00:26:21,749 --> 00:26:25,409
cook getting something like this which

640
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:26,509
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more expensive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

641
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:30,440
tremendously

642
00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:33,320
so this this cooktop is I think forty

643
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">dollars and it uses my man conduction to</font>

644
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:39,139
heat up the heat up the pan and it will

645
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:40,728
actually transfer that heat very evenly

646
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:43,668
and very effectively a lot of high-end

647
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:45,709
restaurants well it will have very clean

648
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:47,779
setups where they'll have instead of

649
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:49,489
traditional burners they'll just have

650
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:51,259
blank countertops stainless-steel

651
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:52,789
countertops and they'll have a bunch of

652
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:55,399
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can reposition move</font>

653
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:58,190
around so you can use this and just cook

654
00:26:55,399 --> 00:27:00,559
anything that you would in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pam if you</font>

655
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:03,139
want it to go a little bit you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know keep</font>

656
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:05,389
it compact and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know keep things</font>

657
00:27:03,139 --> 00:27:09,049
pretty small you can get pans with

658
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:11,149
Google handles pack that up small you

659
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:13,609
can cook your standard stuff your eggs

660
00:27:11,149 --> 00:27:16,369
vegetables means whatever in this thing

661
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:19,789
but you can also do if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

662
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:24,649
it a little bit more you know off the

663
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:28,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">side you can do things like the Harold</font>

00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:32,208
<font color="#E5E5E5">McGee talks about making pasta has some</font>

665
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:33,949
weird ways to make pasta so he the way

666
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:35,479
he recommends making pasta is actually

667
00:27:33,949 --> 00:27:38,089
putting possible bottom of the pot

668
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:40,669
adding some water out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your salt all</font>

669
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:42,499
while cold and then bringing it up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

671
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:46,009
boil maybe you'll need to leave it there

00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:47,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">a minute but the possible of cooked the</font>

673
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:50,089
whole time so you could do something

674
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:52,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">like take some spaghetti break it in</font>

675
00:27:50,089 --> 00:27:53,809
half fit it into the pan fill it up with

676
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:57,979
water until it's about maybe an inch

677
00:27:53,809 --> 00:28:01,039
above the above the pasta cook it in

678
00:27:57,979 --> 00:28:04,279
there add in so whatever extra stuff

679
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:06,889
you've got sauces or just it on its<font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font>

680
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:08,959
maybe if you want to go here<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add an</font>

681
00:28:06,889 --> 00:28:11,240
egg or something in there you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

682
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:13,880
pasta dish just in one pan

683
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,000
dump it out right onto a plate you don't

684
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,800
have anything else to clean up so

685
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,370
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different things that</font>

686
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:24,260
you can do using these these materials a

00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:32,059
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different interesting ways that</font>

688
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:35,090
you can go afterwards I after I usually

689
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:38,600
do a trip I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> course more I'll take</font>

690
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:40,280
take a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I made figure out</font>

691
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay what was successful what was it</font>

692
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,280
becomes even with a couple other people

693
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,649
what did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like about that is there</font>

694
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,860
anything any ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have that</font>

695
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:51,559
becomes kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know fairly</font>

696
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:54,219
important just to not necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep a</font>

697
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:57,050
detailed record but just generally know

698
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,460
what's going on nothing I do is if it's

699
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:00,710
something I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to visit a number of</font>

700
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:02,809
times I'll make a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

701
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:04,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">places I went to see if there's anything</font>

702
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:06,170
around that's going to be useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:09,350
future think place I visited place that

00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:11,600
didn't visit you know if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

705
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,709
anything that I was doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> research on</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the area was going to be ahead of time</font>

00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,770
and I didn't see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then when I got</font>

708
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,120
inside oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

709
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">stayed across the street because that</font>

710
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:24,860
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever that was near whatever</font>

711
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:27,559
making out of that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff same</font>

712
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:30,080
vein isn't necessarily gonna be on a map

713
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:31,850
we're going to be on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a website so you</font>

714
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,649
know even if I'm not necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

715
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:36,230
you think about afterwards since I'll

716
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:41,000
just wander around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the area seeing if</font>

717
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:43,220
there's other stuff near there and with

718
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,630
a lot of this stuff I think you know I

719
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:49,100
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tried to give a broad overview</font>

720
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:51,170
but I think the most important thing

721
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,750
that you can really take away from this

722
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:57,800
is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can grab these tools these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

723
00:29:53,750 --> 00:30:00,380
great tools to use but really the best

724
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,090
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do is learn about this</font>

725
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:05,240
stuff even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font>

726
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:07,699
into practice on any given day there are

727
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of great ways to learn about</font>

728
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,280
cooking actually the next talk is

729
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:15,610
covering a lot of a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

730
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,399
traditional cooking stuff this stuff

731
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:19,810
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're not into it as a foodie</font>

732
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,640
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of entertainment that you</font>

733
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:24,580
can consume they'll back door that

734
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:27,550
information in I'm a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> fan of Alton</font>

735
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:31,149
Brown if anybody's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever seen him like</font>

736
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:33,100
that is the way I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> into cooking was I</font>

737
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:35,920
was just out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> college living in a</font>

738
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:39,010
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> rundown apartment building in New</font>

739
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:41,200
York and we had because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in New York</font>

740
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:43,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">City didn't really get much over the air</font>

741
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,210
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> building had coupled hardwired</font>

742
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:48,760
cable channels basic cable was pretty

743
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:50,470
much I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was MTV Comedy Central</font>

744
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,600
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Food Network Santa I'm watch a</font>

lot of food<font color="#CCCCCC"> network watch a lot of alton</font>

746
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,459
brown stuff his show good eats is

747
00:30:54,460 --> 00:31:00,280
actually entertaining and he is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find</font>

748
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:03,010
it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be incredibly fascinating and a</font>

749
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,379
real real point of access but people

750
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:07,540
like us because he delves into the

751
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:10,030
science behind it and isn't necessarily

752
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:12,430
focusing on the individual particular

753
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:14,530
recipes you understand the reasoning

754
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:17,320
behind him and you're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to once you</font>

755
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:18,399
go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> that apply the theory the</font>

756
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,590
next time you encounter something

757
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:23,470
because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just ok now we're going</font>

758
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:25,600
to add ingredient a DC but to understand

759
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:28,900
the science involved you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could really</font>

760
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,810
you know take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it one step further he</font>

761
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:34,840
also has a lot of great books his first

762
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:37,600
book<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically just applying heat to</font>

763
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,790
proteins so if you want a basic internal

764
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:43,629
cooking that's a great great place to

765
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:46,120
start he has a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> other books these</font>

766
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:48,280
other books at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom those ones are</font>

767
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:51,399
basically promptly every single episode

768
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:54,660
of his show and every recipe in every

769
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:57,940
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those shows then ran for it was</font>

770
00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:00,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">it was I think was 11 or 12 years in</font>

771
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,539
like 14 seasons over those years I just

772
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:06,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">saw this live</font>

773
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:10,169
shirts fantastic are you he did homemade

774
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:12,960
ice cream using<font color="#CCCCCC"> a.m. fire extinguisher</font>

775
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:14,580
sure yeah yeah you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that you have</font>

776
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">to fight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> although I think he probably</font>

777
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:19,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't recommend using a fire</font>

778
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:21,289
extinguisher in a home setting but you

779
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,799
know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are people who do that with</font>

780
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:24,799
with all sources
