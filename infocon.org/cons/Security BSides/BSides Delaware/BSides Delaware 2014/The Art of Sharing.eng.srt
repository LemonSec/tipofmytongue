00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:07,560
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those come out there</font>

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,210
hello I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk today about the</font>

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">artist sharing what we're talking about</font>

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,590
today in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this session is the ability for</font>

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,420
us to share information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,970
threats that were observing with other

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,730
organizations without giving up anything

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,400
that we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> already sharing with the</font>

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,510
outside world who in years is sharing

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:31,198
threat information I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a show of hands</font>

11
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:32,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so that's like three I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that quiz again at the end of the</font>

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,820
session and I think we're going to see a

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,680
lot more a lot more people sharing than

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,739
they think that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are on what I'm</font>

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,719
going to talk about today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is i think the</font>

17
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,629
security market in general is coming

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,570
down coming around to a recognition of

19
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,640
the fact that it's very important for us

20
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,289
to understand what threats are affecting

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,260
people across our particular industry

22
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,940
and across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire IT marketplace and</font>

23
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,379
in order to do that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be</font>

24
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,989
sharing information about the threats

25
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,218
that we're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit with and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

26
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are hesitant to do this because</font>

27
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:08,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">of privacy concerns they're very worried</font>

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,979
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensitive information getting</font>

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:15,298
<font color="#E5E5E5">leaked out particularly about about</font>

30
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,679
major intrusions major hackers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that get</font>

31
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,330
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> their network might steal a lot of</font>

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,619
data they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,939
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> until they're ready to share</font>

34
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that information there's a lot of PR</font>

35
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,529
involved in those types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of threats well</font>

36
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,140
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about is a lower bar</font>

37
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,150
lowering the bar for sharing to

38
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,880
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's more palatable across</font>

39
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,950
the wider base of organizations so that

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,649
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a high level of usefulness</font>

41
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,380
with a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very low risk of disclosure</font>

42
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,600
about that information so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is Roy</font>

43
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,899
Stefan I'm from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a company called pierce</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">cybersecurity product company that</font>

offers ways to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> information across</font>

47
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,189
different models I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

48
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,780
corporate pitch just we're based out of

49
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,289
Virginia so we're fairly local

50
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,450
organization and we have a large

51
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,190
global threat database that we can

52
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,810
integrate with your log files and

53
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">provide you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information about malicious</font>

54
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,800
actors that are in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network but I'm</font>

55
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,430
not here today<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about my product</font>

56
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,660
what I'm here today to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is the</font>

57
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,420
methodologies and the approach to

58
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:20,210
privacy that we used behind are sharing

59
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,829
mechanisms so well first started out we

60
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:24,320
look at the fact that systems

61
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,180
administrators are very smart people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

62
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,829
configuring their networks to keep the

63
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,450
bad guys out there not one hundred

64
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,860
percent successful nobody's a hundred

65
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,350
percent successful keeping the bad guys

66
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:36,170
out but if they let legitimate traffic

67
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:38,150
be blocked then they come under extreme

68
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:41,208
pressure from<font color="#E5E5E5"> their organizations to</font>

69
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,520
remediate those situations so what we

70
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:45,830
can tell is<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything they let in isn't</font>

71
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,290
necessarily good by definition but the

72
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:51,650
things that they're blocking tends to be

73
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:53,030
on average much worse than the goodness

74
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,140
of things are letting in is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

75
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,489
sense you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust the things they're</font>

76
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,320
blocking better than you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust the</font>

77
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:58,670
things that they're letting in and

78
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's because business practices won't</font>

79
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:04,070
let them lock legit into traffic and if

80
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,780
they do not for very long so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font>

81
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:08,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at is the information that gets</font>

82
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,390
blocked the people that organizations

83
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,160
know up front are malicious actors the

84
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,559
things that are happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

85
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,720
network that are already known to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

86
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,489
malicious to one organization that may

87
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,470
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> known to be malicious to other</font>

88
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:23,510
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this comes down a lot</font>

89
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,180
to customizations comes down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> white</font>

90
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">lists if people are picking up hackers</font>

91
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,530
and attackers because their firewalls

92
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,660
blanket policies are covering them or

93
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,400
because the signature analysis on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Navy</font>

94
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,560
is covering them that's not necessarily

95
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,209
new information from a sharing

96
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,160
information perspective to the rest of

97
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:41,540
the network what is interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

98
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,880
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> unique from an information sir</font>

99
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,260
sharing perspective are the hackers that

100
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">are being stopped by your white list</font>

101
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:51,299
your heuristics the the customizations

102
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:53,370
that are done beyond the standard

103
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,940
interest and analysis and that is where

104
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,980
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can identify zero days and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

105
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:01,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">information sharing becomes extremely</font>

106
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:04,709
important extremely valuable as i said

107
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,149
before sharing is fairly tricky there's

108
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,950
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of sensitive personal information</font>

109
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,900
that's out there there's a lot of people

110
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are already sharing enormous</font>

111
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,410
amounts of sensitive information<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

112
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,550
the likes of Google and Facebook they're

113
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,589
doing this more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than their personal</font>

114
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,209
lives in their business lives but we've

115
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,369
seen the value that people can derive

116
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,290
from sharing information and on a

117
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,610
generational basis what we're seeing is

118
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,050
people are starting to be more

119
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">comfortable with sharing information</font>

120
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:30,780
that they were you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know 20 years ago or</font>

121
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,670
ten years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago even what's interesting</font>

122
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,080
that happened with Edward Snowden I

123
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,850
think we're all familiar everyone knows

124
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,020
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the study case Ravens that's</font>

125
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:42,240
universe never<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard of never so uh what</font>

126
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,950
Snowden highlighted I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

127
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">many people should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have been surprised</font>

130
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,560
highlighted for everybody was the fact

131
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,090
that there's a lot of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

132
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,550
out there in the open your ISPs have a

lot of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you a lot of</font>

in all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our communications so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font>

151
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:35,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question again how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many people in</font>

here think that they're sharing

information every one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are sharing</font>

information whether you want to or not

155
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,940
you know and when we think about sharing

156
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,470
information

157
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,450

<font color="#E5E5E5">the IT world but what's come out and</font>

161
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,270
what's commonly known now is that

162
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,270
organizations have their information

163
00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:00,479
being taken being looked at and being

164
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:02,940
used globally and and what we talk about

165
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:06,000
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that information is not</font>

166
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,530
encrypted it's not secure how can we

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,540
take that information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some</font>

utilization out of it ourselves if we

00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,110
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to share and we would</font>

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,000
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the benefits of that sharing</font>

171
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,730
that information is already being used

172
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,620
how can we turn this around and use this

173
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,450
information to gain some usefulness

174
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,430
ourselves if we're already sharing

00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,050
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this slide we</font>

recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are already sharing</font>

177

this information no matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font>

legal department says about it no what

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:33,210
no matter what executives<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about it</font>

180
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,710
at an IT level we can recognize our

181
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,440
information is being shared widely

182
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:40,260
already then we can take that

183
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">information and we can use it for for</font>

184
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,680
good we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it for our own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> purposes</font>

00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,990
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to better protect ourselves</font>

186
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,580
through actively participating and

187
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,410
actively sharing that information with

188
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,150
each other it's already<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there in a</font>

while did you have a question sir we

just especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

191
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,169
so when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at sharing we try to</font>

192
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,440
reduce this down the previously solve

the equation good<font color="#CCCCCC"> good mathematics say</font>

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,620
somebody out there has already solved

this at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least in pieces or in parts we</font>

196
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,979
looked across a number of different

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,620
happening we're open data is being

00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,840
exchanged well look at the reasons why

201
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,490
those systems have been successful where

202
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,049
so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have a belief that</font>

203
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,639
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sharing so many people have</font>

204
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,889
a belief<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're against sharing in</font>

205
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,930
their organizations and what we saw is a

206
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:27,610
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different areas spam</font>

207

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,060
who's spamming with them they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

209
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,050
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider that sharing that</font>

210
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,419
they are they're sharing those IP

organizations your signature analysis

not everybody contributes the signatures

215
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:47,318
but there's there's a widely recognized

216
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:48,669
methodology for creating generic

217
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:50,289
signatures and being able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share that</font>

218
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:52,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">information back into the community</font>

219
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:54,520
without giving up a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensitive</font>

00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,960
information about attacks that may have

00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,849
worked or not worked against your

222
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,930
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when you look at</font>

223
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:04,419
something as simple as DNS requests even

224
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:07,719
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to resolve an IP address into</font>

225
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:10,508
a hostname or the reverse but I hope

226
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:12,250
universal<font color="#CCCCCC"> it of our normal up is still</font>

227
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:13,900
sharing information with the DMS system

228
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,000
you're still taking a bit of information

229
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your communications you're taking</font>

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,710
and you're resolving a domain name into

233
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,750
that IP address all of that information

234

236
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,799
several examples of the fact

237
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,020
that we talk to companies every day that

238
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,969
say I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> share anything legal will</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of situations here that</font>

00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,380
with legal organizations in many

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,060
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies and said show me the</font>

250
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,470
there's IP addresses that are passing

are these successes have in common

they're self-limiting there's some there

that they have two more<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they can</font>

see the more value that they can add

changing themselves because they're

derive the maximum value that they could

information out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the US census are we</font>

allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to publish publicly because as</font>

322
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:45,399
we collect information on on all these

323
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,110
households there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of sensitive</font>

324
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,670

00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,559
publish every bit of information that we

<font color="#E5E5E5">that we perform census for tax and</font>

voting reasons and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> different types</font>

331
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,849
of reasons and the challenge in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front of</font>

332
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:05,889
sentences is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much of that data do we</font>

333
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:09,360
share back to the community and which

334
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:11,160
pieces of it have as it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

335
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,040
maximum amount of utility the most

336
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,660
usefulness that we can get well the same

337
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,360
time having the lowest risk of

338
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:20,399
disclosure so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at census</font>

339
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,370
what they identified was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a particular</font>

340
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">trip point right here which was sort of</font>

341
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,870
the ideal position where they're getting

342
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">the maximum amount of utility out of the</font>

343
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:32,610
data possible with a minimal amount of

344
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:34,290
risk of disclosure so we've applied that

345
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,790
across the board to a number of

346
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:39,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">different technologies that want to wear</font>

347
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:41,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">up in the marketplace and yeah okay but</font>

348
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:43,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't hold me to exactly the placement</font>

349
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,089
here this is our interpretation of what

350
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:47,640
we've seen from the market that the

351
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:49,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">reaction of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the markets I don't want</font>

352
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,319
google it wouldn't come after me and Sue

353
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,050
me but from our perspective what we've

354
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,450
seen in census of course built the model

355
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:00,000
so by definition there there at the

356
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,399
truth<font color="#E5E5E5"> point and this is this is their</font>

357
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,950
model so that's where we placed them as

358
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,680
we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the stack we see people that</font>

359
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,709
have higher levels of disclosure risk

360
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,910
more information that they're sharing

361
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:13,649
but they've thrown that line differently

362
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:16,050
so so we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> created more of a tolerance</font>

363
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:18,870
range where people are pretty okay with

364
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:21,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way Microsoft does things Facebook</font>

365
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,949
and Google sort of are right at the top

366
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,300
of tolerance range and you can see when

367
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:26,550
they go beyond the tolerance range

368
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,649
there's now product from the public they

369
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,569
set up a new option they set up a new to

370
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:32,459
fall and they draw themselves back into

371
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,410
the tolerance range so so over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

372
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:36,689
two years we've been seeing a lot of a

373
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,310
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook and Google here popping</font>

374
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,230
out of that tolerance range<font color="#CCCCCC"> in back in</font>

375
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,729
and they like and they try to operate

376
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,350
right at the top of that range as

377
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,000
opposed to census who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

378
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:48,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">operate more at the bottom of this range</font>

379
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,620
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then spying programs right off the</font>

380
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,899
chart they don't care so when we looked

381
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,110
at those technologies that I talked

382
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:59,180
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the last slide we really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

383
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,279
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> objective zone is here sort of</font>

384
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,620
sensitive below if you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

385
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,660
maximize people's comfort level with

386
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:09,140
sharing their information you need to

387
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:11,990
self limit yourself to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

388
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:14,510
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is below this this tolerance range</font>

389
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,490
and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the technologies that have</font>

390
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,589
been successful this is the the DNS

391
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:21,230
system we talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about even IP headers</font>

392
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:22,579
right people people know that IP headers

393
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,490
are unencrypted and they still use the

394
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:27,229
internet anyways so so that objective

395
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,610
range is really right there but

396
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:30,709
something interesting about an email

397
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:33,950
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> email is just sort of floating</font>

398
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:36,260
out of that range which probably should

399
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:41,420
happen decades ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that's my</font>

400
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:43,160
personal feelings so as an organization

401
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,370
we came up with a statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

402
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">privacy protected crowdsourcing it's a</font>

403
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:51,019
bit of an oxymoron I think if you guys

404
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,820
are the description I said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what</font>

405
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:55,550
we mean by<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy protected</font>

406
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,680
crowdsourcing is we're identifying the

407
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:00,620
pieces of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your information that are</font>

408
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">already known are already public and</font>

409
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,370
we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at ways that we can share</font>

410
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:06,469
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information across the widest</font>

411
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,930
number of organizations so that they can

412
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:11,180
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> protected without the risk of</font>

00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:16,069
business data out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network so so</font>

415
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,290
we're moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that communication</font>

416
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:21,490
that that coordination is sharing

417
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:23,719
removing any IP address excuse me

418
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:26,390
removing it like social security numbers

419
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">hipot information % in a viable</font>

information

421
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,710
coming from from a packet level captures

422
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,510
taking all that information out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

423
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:37,690
equation and saying look this is too

424
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:39,819
sensitive there's too low of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> value for</font>

425
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,860
sharing that information let's look at

426
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:44,980
the communication level so let me give

427
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:47,080
you a specific example of this when you

428
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,520
block somebody at your firewall it could

429
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,490
be any number of reasons why you're

430
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,530
blocking at your firewall who in here

431
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:57,700
collects that data on the people they

432
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:59,350
block at their firewall right we talked

433
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to a lot of organizations and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">people didn't raise your hand we talked</font>

about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're much more concerned</font>

441
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:15,010
that we're talking about here looks at

442
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,260
the things that are blocked in one

443
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,819

444
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,069
somebody you block somebody new block

prioritize your alerts your warnings you

459
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,070
saw on target there was there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

460
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,170
several different systems that alerted

461
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,730
warned about this stuff and they just it

462
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,990
just never really<font color="#CCCCCC"> got hurt eyes right</font>

463
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,210
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> never got respected by the</font>

management to the last guys talk for

ignored<font color="#E5E5E5"> the warnings that were coming</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">out and that's why sisters are getting</font>

471
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,400
at the border because people getting

472
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,169
fired over this now and we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

473
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,449
that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past with technology</font>

474
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,160
breaches it sort of been limited to a

475
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:19,930
technology for all them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now it's</font>

476
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,530
expanded out to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the true executive</font>

problem up into the border

478
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:26,089
and that's why we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing a lot more</font>

479
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:29,560
attention and why target<font color="#CCCCCC"> was such a game</font>

480
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:32,720
changer with<font color="#CCCCCC"> is as an aside from the top</font>

481
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,550
we've all seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundreds of thousands</font>

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe millions of attacks just like</font>

483
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Target over the years and there's always</font>

484
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,879
kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a reaction a</font>

485
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,250
little bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a jump in people paying</font>

486
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,470
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> and budgets etc maybe hire an</font>

487
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,450
extra guy but the target<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is is</font>

488
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:49,430
completely different<font color="#E5E5E5"> not because of the</font>

489
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,680
technology that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was employed or the way</font>

490
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,060
the hackers work it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

491
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,610
different because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the effect that</font>

492
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:57,679
that had in the boardroom and that's

493
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:59,649
that's why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean person that's why I</font>

494
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:03,590
see target is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> game-changer for</font>

495
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:05,450
securities industry because the pain is

496
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,970
actually starting to be felt at those

497
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,070
upper echelons and I think the last guys

498
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,930
talk actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> highlighted a lot of a lot</font>

499
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:15,950
of very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> points around that around</font>

500
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:18,140
that particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspect so anyways that's</font>

501
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:23,270
that's what we mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> by privacy protected</font>

502
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:24,820
crowdsourcing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i'm gonna jump</font>

503
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,080
into the summer<font color="#E5E5E5"> year because i'd like to</font>

504
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,790
have a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes i know on the last</font>

505
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,760
person standing between you and lunch so

506
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:33,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">i feel that and i know i'm not going to</font>

507
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,120
keep your attention too long here but

508
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:39,770
really when we look at last<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years of</font>

509
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,080
business intelligence and big data

510
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,520
analysis as its come along it spent a

511
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,929
lot of time trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn data into</font>

512
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,780
information you've probably all heard

513
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:49,880
heard that spiel all the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

514
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,370
buzzwords what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at here is</font>

515
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,190
is providing perspective being able to

516
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,689
take large amounts of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font>

517
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">may be overwhelming us in terms of</font>

518
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,970
alerts of warnings already and adding

519
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,770
perspective to that ironically by adding

520
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,410
more data the problem to our data

521
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:08,389
problem is more down right it's an

522
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:11,210
interesting statement but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you look</font>

523
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:13,460
at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a perspective aspect the fact</font>

524
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:15,980
that we have tons<font color="#E5E5E5"> of alerts of warnings</font>

525
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,910
and all of the filters that are on our

526
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,740
network are looking at a finite

527
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:22,380
data which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

528
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,390
just in our network so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we have three</font>

529
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,600
filters or nine filters are 15 different

530
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:31,350
filters between AV firewall IPS is

531
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,600
content filters etc the return on

532
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:36,480
investment for<font color="#E5E5E5"> added yet another filter</font>

533
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,879
looking at that existing set of data is

534
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,340
quite marginal when you're able to bring

535
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,140
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new set of information when you're</font>

536
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,909
able to add perspective to that data

537
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,740
that you weren't able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see before it</font>

538
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,030
actually takes all of those sensors and

539
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,580
filters that you have on your network

540
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that makes them more effective because</font>

541
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're not just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spinning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out flat rent</font>

542
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,190
alerts across the board you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can take all</font>

543
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,590
the red alerts that are coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from your</font>

544
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,540
systems and you can prioritize them by

545
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,100
what the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world knows about</font>

546
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,620
what's going on in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network and</font>

547
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,480
that's that's highly critical for being

548
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to respond quickly and being able</font>

549
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,610
to identify no malicious actors I'll say

550
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:14,460
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> again no malicious actors we're not</font>

551
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:16,889
finding people that that were never

552
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,140
known or never detected anywhere what

553
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:21,780
we're doing is cross educating but we've

554
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,520
each learned and detected somewhere so

555
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can take that low hanging fruit</font>

556
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,750
off of the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can deal with those</font>

557
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,790
known malicious actors first so we don't

558
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,560
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep reinventing the wheel does</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean all the attacks are gone no</font>

560

<font color="#CCCCCC">up with new attacks and coming after us</font>

563
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,250
in new ways but we'll have more time and

564
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:42,720
more resources to<font color="#E5E5E5"> devote to finding</font>

those new attacks in those new

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,200
directions if we can automate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we can</font>

567
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:51,900
share and avoid the duplicated work of

as a community we can defend ourselves
