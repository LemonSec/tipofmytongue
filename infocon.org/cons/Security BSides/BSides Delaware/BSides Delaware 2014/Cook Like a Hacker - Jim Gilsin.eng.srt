I'm flirting packing and stuff like that

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,800
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found some similarities and thought</font>

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,660
it would be kind of fun to talk about

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:27,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">besides great for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that kinda stuff the</font>

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,179
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing okay I'm not talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,070
simple stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> like takeout pizza ramen</font>

11
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,250
noodles cereal and stuff like that

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,989
that's everyone does that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of stuff</font>

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,030
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about taking a dig near</font>

14
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:42,870
stuff to the next level trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,300
out how to cook better i'm also not

16
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:49,649
talking about baking baking is hard and

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,780
it takes precision cooking is something

18
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,190
you can do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sorts of stuff and</font>

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can experiment and play around of</font>

20
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,699
things you get into baking this there's

21
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,190
there's you got to be like really

22
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">precise with things and there's a lot</font>

23
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,000
more techniques that go along with that

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,960
i'm also not talking about presentation

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,990
i suck at making food look nice I put it

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">on a plate and it works as long as it</font>

27
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,210
tastes good that's what's important to

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,500
me

29
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:20,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">though about me I love to cook I love</font>

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,810
thee I started cooking probably around

31
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,590
ten years old I was a latchkey kid so

32
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:28,930
from fourth grade on I was home alone

33
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,820
until my parents to come over<font color="#E5E5E5"> work so I</font>

34
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,310
had to figure out how to cook and how to

35
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,320
deal with stacks after school stuff like

36
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,290
that early on<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I was in high school</font>

37
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:43,300
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> cooking one meal a week at least</font>

38
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:45,429
full meal and I my mom has lots and lots

39
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">of spices and herbs and all this kind of</font>

40
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:48,820
stuff around house I didn't have the

41
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:51,759
ability to let go and figure all this

42
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,800
stuff out this was well before Google

43
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,710
and things like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kinda had to</font>

44
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,289
learn by smell and taste so I had to

45
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:04,089
kind of figure things out experiment she

46
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:07,450
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on so in my day job I do ICS</font>

47
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:10,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cana assessments and designs I'm an</font>

48
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,769
engineer on I'm a programmer basically

49
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:14,920
I'm an electrical engineer that learned

50
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:16,269
how to program and I'm not a hacker but

51
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,679
as I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been learning a lot more about</font>

52
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hackerspace and stuff like that I</font>

53
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't figure out there's sort of a</font>

54
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:26,290
mentality and a weight that hacking kind

55
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:30,250
of gets done so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my little thing</font>

56
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:32,489
of what the hacker mentality<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there's</font>

57
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,200
a lot of equipment tools resources

58
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:37,930
information everything it's all sorts of

59
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,328
<font color="#CCCCCC">things out there sort of question</font>

60
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,519
everything so why does it do that what's

61
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:44,920
this oh that looks interesting let me go

62
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:49,180
look into that there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sort of</font>

63
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">this just questioning mentality and then</font>

64
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,500
a lot of experimentation and figuring

65
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:55,450
things out yourself you can teach

66
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,280
yourself a lot just<font color="#E5E5E5"> by looking at online</font>

67
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,319
resources there's tons of stuff out

68
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,480
there book

69
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,638
everything out there to like learn from

70
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,108
and there's also a community<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people</font>

71
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">that want to share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this information with</font>

72
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:07,680
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> meetings so sharing with others</font>

73
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,260
that's another big thing about the

74
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,260
hacker sort of mentality and then

75
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,090
teaching others what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know so sharing</font>

76
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,170
with others just basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> information and</font>

77
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,180
learning for others but then also

78
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,488
teaching it to other<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and really</font>

79
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,340
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain stuff to somebody else so</font>

80
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:26,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can learn or better yourself so</font>

81
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,569
there's lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment out there cook</font>

82
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:35,000
and stuff and lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff on the</font>

83
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:35,000
network security side there's lots tools

84
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:40,738
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of techniques so I mean you</font>

85
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:44,429
got grilling<font color="#E5E5E5"> barbecue bacon fresh hooks</font>

86
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:46,769
you bring up<font color="#CCCCCC"> subi last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk roasting</font>

87
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:50,250
students on the right hand side yeah

88
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:52,709
assessments audits packed an active

89
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,840
scanning pen test we're driving all<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

90
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:56,819
messed up to them and then there's

91
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,449
resources tons and tons of resources

92
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:02,219
this is actually pictures for my

93

cookbooks out there lots and<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

95
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:13,409
books on nice security and programming

96
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:16,858
and different ICS kind of things and

97
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:19,649
scada and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> my stuff's out there lots</font>

98
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:22,048
lots of stuff online Google is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

99
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:25,138
friend you don't like Google their thing

100
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:27,739
with Yahoo there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> DuckDuckGo really</font>

101
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,740
want to secure

102
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:35,060
it's either and soon our pinterest and

103
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:41,930
places like that date they have tons of

104
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:45,590
information recipes recipes are a good

105
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:48,560
place to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

106
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:52,369
thing on the security side procedures

107
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,680
everyone has a procedure for some but if

108
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:58,100
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn something new great do</font>

109
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,310
that do a recipe first figure it out but

110
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,320
then learn from there if you try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

111
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,450
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> very specific if you know that</font>

112
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,320
you want to make this particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> recipe</font>

113
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:11,539
and you need to reproduce it for a large

114
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,260
number of people or maybe you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

115
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,460
to actually go and make it for

116
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:20,090
competition or some like that and do it

117
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:22,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a recipe a lot of times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mostly just</font>

118
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,770
suggestions<font color="#E5E5E5"> for amounts and times and</font>

119
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:28,700
temperatures and things like that it's

120
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:30,320
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be to taste comment in a</font>

121
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">recipe because everyone likes it</font>

122
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,190
slightly different same thing with

123
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,900
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if you're trying to do</font>

124
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,450
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> very specific yeah recipes</font>

125
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,280
very good procedures they're very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

126
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,570
laying out if you're doing a dark sip

127
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,159
water or something like that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta</font>

128
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:47,539
lay out and have your checklist right

129
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:49,550
there but most of time it's a suggestion

130
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:52,280
for a workflow how you would go about

131
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,260
doing a pen test or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font>

132
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">know for a pen test you're going to</font>

133
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,520
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OPSEC and then you're going</font>

134
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,020
to do some social engineering or

135
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,878
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like that</font>

136
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:05,389
vulnerability assessment you start out

137
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:07,520
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pink sweep and then you do some</font>

138
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:08,840
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of passive scanning for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

139
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">paint sweep to figure out what devices</font>

140
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,400
are out there and maybe move on to an

141
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">nmap below bed and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> madam scan or</font>

142
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">something and and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff</font>

143
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:18,860
but then there's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

144
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:22,460
something you find in that vulnerability

145
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:24,289
assessment that is something you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

146
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,000
investigate for something some device

147
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:27,349
did something you didn't expect and so

148
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">now you want to investigate further so</font>

149
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:32,240
now you know you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to adjust what you</font>

150
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,639
do and the procedure you follow based on

151
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,539
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to find during during your</font>

requirements and constraints cocaine

154
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,840
maybe your field Koecher allow

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the right hand side there's always</font>

158
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,280
going to be stuff you run into when

159
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,319
you're running assessments or going

160
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,719
things oh you can't touch that system

161
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,770
over there that's that's too fragile and

162
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:08,800
it won't handle anything or this is this

163

00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:15,590
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pen test well do you reason</font>

where you've got the unlock doors and

173
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,330
your guard gates and stuff like that so

<font color="#E5E5E5">it's those kind of questions and</font>

all time

177
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,859
and experimentation ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

experimentation is a big part of packet

180
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:53,849
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> always got to try and experiment</font>

181
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,490
with new things experiment with

182
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:58,409
different techniques maybe you hear

183
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,460
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> new software that's out there</font>

184
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:01,438
and you want to play<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it so you got</font>

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:05,818
to figure out maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> sell lab internally</font>

systems that you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and play around</font>

188
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:11,188
<font color="#E5E5E5">with it and then then you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

189
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,020
add up to your like list of things that

00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:16,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can actually claim that you can do</font>

191
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,448
has it been solving too low well if

192
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,770
you've never tried it there's no way

193
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:22,199
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

194
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:25,650
customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> site probably so you gotta try</font>

195
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:28,319
maybe you fail a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> times same thing</font>

196
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:31,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">with cooking you're gonna fail or what</font>

197
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:35,969
is considered not what you were looking

198
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:38,098
for so maybe you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want and you went</font>

199
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:39,779
trying to this particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> recipe or</font>

200
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,430
something like that then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> threw in</font>

201
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,929
something maybe too much salt and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

202
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:45,839
you had to change it because you need to

203
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:47,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">throw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in some potatoes or something like</font>

204
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,769
that to absorb the salt or then you had

205
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,670
to change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> recipe summer you throw a</font>

206
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:55,050
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit this this other thing you're</font>

207
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,880
so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always going to be problems</font>

208
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,310
to run into and cooking and you gotta

209
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,410
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of roll</font>

210
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:05,719
go how things work just recently I made

211
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,640
a mistake of trying to put I didn't have

212
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,800
milk so I was making tuna casserole I

213
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:15,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">didn't think I have milk on site I had</font>

214
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:17,060
vanilla almond milk tasted horrendous it

215
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,800
was an experiment to see if it would

216
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,260
work and it didn't quite work out the

217
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,209
way I thought I couldn't stand it turned

218
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,850
out actually one of my relatives did

219
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:28,310
like it so they said that talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

220
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,350
they took<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole thing I didn't like</font>

221
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:36,020
it didn't end up how I I thought was a

222
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:38,570
failure but they like so a couple

223
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">examples of things that kind I found</font>

224
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,490
that are good things to play<font color="#E5E5E5"> around with</font>

225
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:46,760
an experiment so pizza and rice pizza

226
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:49,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay even own a restaurant find all</font>

227
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,500
sorts of stuff and pizza restaurant

228
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:54,050
takes great when you get it actually at

229
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,900
the restaurant you don't take it<font color="#CCCCCC"> home it</font>

230
00:09:54,050 --> 00:10:00,500
typically tastes outstanding why is that

231
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:06,620
typically its heat and it's the dub keep

232
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:08,390
their at home when you make pizza you

233
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">can get your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of times say</font>

234
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:14,240
to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> your oven to 400</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's ring</font>

235
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,560
a pizza ovens typically 650 or higher if

236
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,020
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing with a brick oven pizza</font>

237
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:21,020
that's up to a thousand you're not going

238
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:23,770
to get your typical in-house oven up to

239
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:26,990
those temperatures so what do you do

240
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:28,760
well it<font color="#CCCCCC"> turns out your broiler can</font>

241
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,660
actually get<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to those temperatures or</font>

242
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,759
at least 600 difficult

243
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,500
if you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a self-cleaning oven you can</font>

244
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:37,259
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it up if you really wanted to</font>

245
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:42,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">try but a broiler and i will get around</font>

246
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:44,399
600 so cook it for the base about 400

247
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,819
and then when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to get nice</font>

248
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,519
little crispy crunchy like Bert cheese

249
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:54,089
on top put the broiler on for two

250
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:57,149
minutes at the very<font color="#E5E5E5"> end cooks nice Pizza</font>

251
00:10:54,089 --> 00:11:01,920
grills also work really well I get my

252
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:03,360
girl to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> degrees so it they</font>

253
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,829
cook really well now you<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pay</font>

254
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,110
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it and learn how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font>

255
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:09,779
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> him you got experiment and play</font>

256
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">around with stuff but you can actually</font>

257
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:15,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">cook some really good pizza on a on a</font>

258
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:18,870
grill the dough that's another one of

259
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:20,989
things reproducing at home it depends on

260
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:24,810
what level you want to go to are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

261
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:28,139
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be Alton Brown and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go and make</font>

262
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:30,930
your own know from scratch at home well

263
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:33,240
yeah if you want to try that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

264
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:35,969
suggest a couple methods first before

265
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,550
you do that I even<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on my Bobby Lee</font>

266
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,699
bubbling crusts or like most grocery

267
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:43,889
stores will have their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> brand of</font>

268
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:45,149
crusts and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you do buy</font>

269
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:47,279
one you probably one by one that's

270
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:51,360
uncooked because it will actually cook

271
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:54,240
in the oven better but I have gotten

272
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">into now buying fresh dough and rolling</font>

273
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,630
it out myself and with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

274
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,300
actually stick you get some<font color="#CCCCCC"> really good</font>

275
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,160
pizza and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will taste a lot</font>

276
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:06,209
like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> restaurant-quality</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pizza at home</font>

277
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,550
and then scratch and going there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> tons</font>

278
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:12,180
of recipes online fine how to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

279
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:14,699
own though<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't gotten there yet</font>

280
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,130
rice is another one there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

way you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> Uncle Ben's s Oh probably not</font>

283
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:27,930
it's actually actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not one of the</font>

best<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways to make rice um and then why</font>

285
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,829
does rice end up like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this big ball of</font>

286
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,870
goo most of the time yeah it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good</font>

287
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,399
when you first make it but then give it

288
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">half an hour and it turns in its big</font>

289
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:40,950
block well a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cause</font>

290
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:43,260
of starch so one of the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you</font>

291
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,670
got to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> rinse your rice rinse off</font>

292
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,990
all that extra starch on the outside

293
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:50,279
unless you're looking for sticky rice

294
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:52,170
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> making sushi or making like rice</font>

295
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:54,450
balls or talk that he'd probably don't

296
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:57,569
want to star cheer us really gooey rice

297
00:12:54,450 --> 00:13:00,200
so written<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh so just take and rinse in</font>

298
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:03,209
the bowl you'll see it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets cloudy</font>

299
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,950
pour<font color="#CCCCCC"> that water off rinse it again it'll</font>

300
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:07,439
get less cloudy rinse it again maybe

301
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:10,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's not cloudy up at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so that</font>

302
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:15,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">gets off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the starch next thing</font>

303
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:18,779
is is boiling I've got a name<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

304
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:21,600
point where I boil it like pasta pasta

305
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:23,760
you put a big amount of water and you

306
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,040
boil it and then you go and strain off

307
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,569
afterwards and basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what happens is</font>

308
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,670
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're boiling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in enough water</font>

309
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:32,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">they can handle any extra starch it's on</font>

310
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,380
the rice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you get nice big</font>

311
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,480
fluffy rice afterwards it doesn't stick

312
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,760
together you don't have to do this like

313
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,500
okay it's got to sit there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and put the</font>

314
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,540
top on that you don't touch it for five

315
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,390
minutes or you don't touch<font color="#E5E5E5"> me 20 minutes</font>

316
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">or things like that actually you don't</font>

317
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to worry about the amount right you</font>

318
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:49,320

319
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,140
water you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to worry about how</font>

320
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,660
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> it cooks you do but then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again you</font>

321
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,870

327
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,820

that sorry kind of wandering around Leah

334
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:32,150
one of the big things is you want to

335
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,430
share what you do with others it sucks

336
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:37,100
to make food all by<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself because</font>

337
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:42,170
generally all you get is leftovers and

338
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:44,540
dishes so try and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and actually</font>

things and yet idea what to do but then

345
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:01,969

346
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:03,980
stuff with others and then teaching

347
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,410
