00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,309
not reflect the opinions or beliefs of

my employer or any other affiliated

you're at a hacker thank you so I really

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">get this presentation I thought the Venn</font>

players and like DVD players would be

37
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,439
very late but oh it must almost be the

38
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:02,850
same circle no actually I think first

39
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,258
<font color="#E5E5E5">one did the presentation to people the</font>

41
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:10,759
affirmative on a room of like 20-30 some

42
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:14,160
are people so I was a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprised</font>

43
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,929
but you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a standard</font>

44
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,510
role-playing game you know before<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

45
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,390
shooters role-playing games were world

46
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:25,299
of warcraft

47
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,299
DICE's character sheets lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of robots</font>

48
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,080
and all these things came together and

49
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,370
the little ventures as opposed my

50
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,360
presentations I enjoy searching the

51
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:38,200
internet for things safe mode safesearch

52
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,569
being an optional function

53
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,250
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> liked this slide it's going</font>

54
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:45,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be what people actually think we've</font>

55
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:50,000
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> this with dragons that play you</font>

56
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I think it's very true I think</font>

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,090
it speaks a little bit too to the

58
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,319
mentality that some of the people but

59
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">also to the way that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people have</font>

60
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,349
received you know people<font color="#CCCCCC"> were I think</font>

61
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,450
this even<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apartments to the point</font>

62
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:03,920
that spacer was talking about earlier

63
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,769
date has talked with use talking about

64
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,609
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> perception</font>

65
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:13,690
we had the quotes from from the director

66
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:18,069
and from from the head<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hair for Cyber</font>

67
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:20,299
Command basically talking about you know

68
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:22,700
they very much hinted at these

69
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:25,280
stereotypes of hackers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> inviting</font>

70
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,078
professionals in general I think and and

71
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,810
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you see a lot of that</font>

72
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:34,489
here annoy people have perceptions so

73
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,129
the first lesson that kind of take out a

74
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:39,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">ton from dragons is that it takes a team</font>

75
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:41,689
you know and by<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in those & Dragons</font>

76
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:43,849
you have to care the important<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

77
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:46,489
take away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this is never whether</font>

78
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:50,000
it's done from dragons or modern RPGs

79
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:52,430
like warcraft you know pc bae systems

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,049
they all have similar constructs and

81
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,579
that's because<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of them in the end</font>

82
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:57,800
they're somewhat based on letters and

83
00:03:55,579 --> 00:04:00,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">dragons</font>

84
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,510
so all those games<font color="#E5E5E5"> have different</font>

85
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> versus have different skills and</font>

86
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,829
abilities different traits we all have

87
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,160
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're different classes</font>

88
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:14,420
which had different skill sets right you

89
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,519
have you have combat and physical

90
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,370
characters like barbarians and fighters

91
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,340
who get in there and beat the<font color="#E5E5E5"> crap out</font>

92
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,830
of everything you have naija users you

93
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,739
stand in the back in cast wizard<font color="#CCCCCC"> cast</font>

94
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:30,109
spells and heal people and so you have

95
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">different classes that have come</font>

96
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:36,140
together to make a crease of team

97
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:37,970
because you know one person alone can

98
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,890
necessarily do everything so<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font>

99
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,740
it's Dungeons and Dragons you're going

<font color="#CCCCCC">they're being the story or you know</font>

103
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:51,640
you're playing modern role playing games

104
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:54,730
and you've got dungeons and grades all

105
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,020
these other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you know you can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

106
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,480
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there by yourself you need to have a</font>

107
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:02,099
team of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people let's come together to</font>

108
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,100
make you stronger than you actually go

109
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,370
again searching the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting too much</font>

110
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,680
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> did find a picture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

115
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,320
of trying to break this up kind of give

116
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:24,210
a high level view couple classes but

117
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,310
it's not strictly speaking all of them

118
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:30,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">right you're going to have developers</font>

149
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,520
and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times these are overlapping</font>

150
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,200
other areas right because your

151
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,180
developers odds are going to have some

152
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,419

all these mobile constrained

155
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,810
architectures developing is more

156
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,760
restrictive than just writing hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> I were</font>

159
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,639
so in Dungeons<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Dragons a dispositive</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-class you know in the real</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

161
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,779
we called the jack of all trades but

162
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,039
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very you know it's this idea you</font>

163
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:27,249
know somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's good at multiple</font>

164
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:28,779
multiple things you know there's the

00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:31,839
same you know jack of all trades master

166
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:33,789
Tom I tonight the disagree someone with

167
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,249
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you can have somebody who</font>

168
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:38,800
has a broad range he's maybe not good at

169
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:41,589
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the skills but he might be</font>

170
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,800
excellent at networking but and it goes

171
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:49,269
to you know he might know about hardware

172
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,490
he could be you know good dad or or have

173
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:56,559
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just having our general skills and</font>

174
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:58,689
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas that may be useful another</font>

175
00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:02,199
portion of Dungeons and Dragons days

176
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:04,059
alignments and the first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I is</font>

177
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,770
limitation I got really bogged down into

178
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:07,530
the alignment

179
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:09,060
and the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I did it I further</font>

180
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,979
clock down to it because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of</font>

181
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,360
the questions I got asked was why don't

182
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:15,060
understand the alignments and then I

183
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,099
realized something important this from

184
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,909
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> projector</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this presentation which is</font>

185
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:23,460
it doesn't matter the there's a couple

186
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:28,800
slides out of here that seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

187
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:30,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">not human</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok a bit like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so so the</font>

188
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,949
important thing here you know with all

189
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:35,039
these isn't so much to get bogged<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

190
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:37,680
in the wherewithal and how to's of how

191
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,569
characters and classes and alignments

192
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,250
work with in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dungeons and Dragons but</font>

193
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,959
the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that is most important</font>

194
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,649
and what I'm trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get across is</font>

195
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:49,680
that it takes a mix of all of these

196
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:51,390
things right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can apply to some</font>

197
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,310
extent people into different areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

198
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,990
alignments and you have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

199
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,459
right in the agent we different

200
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,410
personalities on the team if everybody

201
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:01,859
is the exact same things the exact same

202
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,839
way and has<font color="#E5E5E5"> that same mentality you</font>

203
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,940
don't have somebody who may not just

204
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who's can look at this</font>

205
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,000
from a different perspective and be like

206
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,020
a wait why are we still<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this the</font>

207
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,980
same way if we did

208
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:17,319
something else maybe would work better

209
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,230
so I didn't leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> extra</font>

210
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">sidelines kind of clarify for anybody</font>

211
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,690
who really does care display the good

212
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:30,640
versus evil that one's pretty clear most

213
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:33,040
people get get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the concept you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cary</font>

send

219
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:51,200
but the waffle side to a rules order

220
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:52,670
tradition try to explain the lawful

221
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,550
people because people like<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh Camille</font>

222
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:59,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">awful people the best way to describe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

223
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:02,089
is the door world dominator<font color="#CCCCCC"> a person has</font>

224
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,560
this moral code of structure but it may

225
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:06,890
be different from everybody else's but

226
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,619
he wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to impose it on very he wants</font>

227
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,810
the Walden kind of his vision whereas

228
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:16,040
the cab people individual is the whole

229
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:18,319
destroyer right if you don't care how

230
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:24,709
the one of the better examples<font color="#CCCCCC"> for cab</font>

231
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:27,250
evil is<font color="#E5E5E5"> installed the dark knight the</font>

portrayal the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joker in that movie is</font>

233
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,390
pretty spot-on for chaotic

234
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:39,130
and so what did i do I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> make version</font>

235
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:40,779
of this that has alarming stigmatism so

236
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:48,009
you know I tried to break<font color="#E5E5E5"> it down a</font>

237
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:51,519
little bit the good on the top and bias

238
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:55,149
but you know the it's basically all your

239
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:59,860
different types of testing feed rate so

240
00:10:55,149 --> 00:11:01,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">CA your certification guys they're going</font>

241
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,370
to be lawful oh great they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a set of</font>

242
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:04,630
rules they won't follow the rules<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

243
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure everything gets checked off</font>

244
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,470
and everything is done right that meets

245
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:09,610
those rules they're not you know if

246
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,990
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like okay this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is good this</font>

anywhere but on the same side they're on

253
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,470
where I say that think the red team's

254

are which is you have a red team during

255

the true penetration test they need to

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,540
ones who want to and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know still</font>

291
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:59,880
information they want to fix your

292
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,170
websites whatever nefarious reason they

293
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,560
might have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

294
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:07,920
for the the giggles order for the lulz

295
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:13,069
you know that's ultimately that's you

296
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,069
know before your enemies<font color="#CCCCCC"> I suppose</font>

297
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:17,069
so the second lesson

298
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:24,650
media director this is where the dungeon

299
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,650
master so

300
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,779
so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been played before you</font>

301
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:34,829
know Dungeon Master's one who's created

302
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:36,899
scenarios that you're playing and who's

303
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:38,459
depending on how he will in how people

304
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:41,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">he is have had some whose main purpose</font>

305
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:45,589
and lightness to make sure you all dodge

306
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:50,790
others want to see you to progress and

307
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:53,009
so it's really you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what's</font>

308
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,290
behind that little screen adult<font color="#CCCCCC"> steven</font>

309
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:56,790
all the plans but i think that's the

310
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,309
important thing right this is the person

311
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:02,429
who has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the plan it has the vision of</font>

312
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:05,040
what of what needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be done and a lot</font>

313
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:06,360
of times the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other side it's the if the</font>

314
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,819
players and<font color="#CCCCCC"> once actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> playing the</font>

315
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,069
game whose job it is Jackson came great

316
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:13,649
in the end how many of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> have managers</font>

317
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:19,279
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually doing the doing day to</font>

318
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:19,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">day technical another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so much but</font>

319
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:28,950
it's you know moving the way herding

320
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:30,630
cats it's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reality I my second</font>

321
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,310
run around as a manager

322
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,660
trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody in the same</font>

323
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,359
place at the same time to do the same

324
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:39,240
thing is or<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something similar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

325
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,560
the same thing is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard for you if</font>

326
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,330
you've hung out google at hacker

327
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,800
conferences it's again very similar

328
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,430
right how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get everybody who can</font>

329
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the same direction at the same time</font>

330
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:50,769
yeah

331
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,910
even though I'm pretty sure people the

332
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:54,100
fire alarm right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now their vehicle</font>

333
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,649
hackers will be round like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem</font>

334
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:05,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">shy don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smell smoke</font>

335
00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:07,690
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> he okay bit I will admit to coming</font>

336
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:09,250
up this time I don't know if your dose

337
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,380
by the elevator there's these stacks of

338
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:14,019
recycling that's the top one has a cell

339
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:16,750
phone on it there are no cell phones in

340
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:20,170
it right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little sad I was</font>

341
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:22,360
hoping somebody might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be the</font>

342
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,050
cell phone

343
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,520
then I was going to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font>

344
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:30,740
direction of the topper<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about why</font>

345
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:33,079
don't you sell phones so we have any

346
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dungeon Master's right you know people</font>

347
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">will dictate what we're doing dictation</font>

348
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,310
store into it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

349
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,420
going to be done whether it's the

350
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,949
customers whether that's customers are

351
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,099
external to your company doing

352
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:49,480
consulting if you're doing I to support

353
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,740
head and an<font color="#E5E5E5"> internal support for your</font>

354
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,270
for your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> company right then the</font>

355
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,510
other people with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> company area</font>

356
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,960
customers your team needs you your

357
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,760
technical team

358
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,270
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> troop supervisor is even tougher</font>

359
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,100
man

360
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,260
because in the end you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you go up</font>

361
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,660
there how much vision they have

362
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:09,150
specifically for you narrows but their

363
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,650
vision overall fits in so if you upper

364
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,120
management level there's the global we

365
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,430
know I have this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what the</font>

366
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,780
company needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the supervisor</font>

367
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,670
should bow that will say ok will make

368
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,890
this happen the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mic would we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

369
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,719
this and so then that leads out to you

370
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:24,540
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have team leads between you and a</font>

371
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,810
manager<font color="#E5E5E5"> they filter out in a delegate</font>

372
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,969
tasks you know they another ones that

373
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:31,709
keep us truly on traffic that right so

374
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:33,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">all these people kind of dictate the</font>

375
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:36,930
story to us they're the ones who leave

376
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:40,590
and if you did have if you didn't have

377
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:42,510
this sort of structure right then you

378
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,710
put a hundred hundred guys in a room and

379
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,410
try to convince<font color="#CCCCCC"> the doll go in what</font>

380
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:48,990
direction are they going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> there not</font>

381
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:51,360
somebody truly to step up we you know

382
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,100
the odds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> attica the both of them all</font>

383
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,710
won't be in same direction are going to

384
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,450
be something<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

385
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:58,450
or at least in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same general</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grip</font>

386
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:06,579
so we got into the third list

387
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:10,240
and this kind of grows out of again me

388
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:14,290
googling answer for dinner so everything

389
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,579
had worked as a doctor great<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did not</font>

390
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,020
have to fabricate these pictures of

391
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:18,909
innovating before but I thought they

392
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:22,470
look incredibly similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the fact that</font>

393
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,470
one is a metal diagram

394
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,460
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight shows I think it shows</font>

395
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:35,260
kind of the is a little bit bit so maybe

396
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:39,100
a little it is a bit too little in some

397
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:42,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense but it's a it's kind of fun dagger</font>

398
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,780
to look at but the reality is when

399
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,090
you're playing Dungeons and Dragons you

400
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:48,460
navigate a dungeon and going as a team

401
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:54,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">you looking around to find you know</font>

402
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:59,620
treasures or sacred princess and you go

403
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:01,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the potential</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at you go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

404
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:05,350
and it ultimately you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

405
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:07,970
tier incorporate whatever that is it

406
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:10,330
varies but

407
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:12,730
you navigate through from point to point

408
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:15,470
to do the same thing in that works right

409
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,120
if you're coming in as a tester and

410
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,040
you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network you're doing</font>

411
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,629
the exact same thing if you're in goal

412
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,340
is to get back<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all the data is</font>

413
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:25,270
stored you're going to navigate through

414
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:27,290
and whichever method is most effective

415
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,629
sometimes you can walk straight in

416
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:33,889
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a giant</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hole in wall</font>

417
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:36,050
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a door and other times you</font>

418
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,240
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work a little harder and so</font>

419
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:41,870
that's where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing comes</font>

420
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:44,000
obstacles when you go into a dungeon you

421
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,429
have things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to be you</font>

422
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,610
know they might be doors you all's

423
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:53,350
making traps we have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing in</font>

424
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,350
network sorry we have firewalls

425
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,610
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of appliances that are</font>

426
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,530
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the same thing and some extent</font>

427
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,629
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can even argue that</font>

428
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:05,360
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-direct necessarily directly</font>

429
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,880
strict obstacle you know if there's a

430
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,320
lot of traffic ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I guess become</font>

431
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,140
the exact

432
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,370
the room

433
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:16,740
child obstacles well if it's a door in

434
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:19,649
dungeons and dragons like you have a

435
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,910
world who comes in Dixville great get

436
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,350
you through and now you're on to the

437
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,350
next tonight estate

438
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,840
and you'll be in a network if you're

439
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:31,240
doing your time to attacking trying to

440
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,459
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a network from now</font>

441
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,530
places and different ones to where you

442
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,230
have to pivot in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front well I got one</font>

443
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:41,250
machine now I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to use that so</font>

444
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,250
it's not that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of straight</font>

445
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:48,270
and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we work around obstacle</font>

446
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">right and some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you might just turn</font>

447
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,510
off

448
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:54,299
if you don't have a road to pick a lock

449
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,480
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were buried at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> door until it</font>

450
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,480
falls

451
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:02,899
which comes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Travis you know whether</font>

452
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:09,630
it's the Indiana Jones<font color="#E5E5E5"> style of giant</font>

453
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:11,820
bowl or you know it's honey pots or

454
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:14,850
is it designed to lure you away from

455
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:17,340
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> old target</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's always to</font>

456
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:20,370
try to to capture your attention and

457
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,720
keep you from getting where you want me

458
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:24,239
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that guess they're just other forms</font>

459
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:28,740
of obstacles sometimes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have to</font>

460
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,980
run with there's creatures right<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anika</font>

461
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,420
dungeon you had to convince of creatures

462
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:36,000
if you've ever played DD there's

463
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:39,580
probably

464
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,470
thousands of in the various books rule

465
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,010
guides and your Dungeon Master pronounce

466
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,010
will be equal with

467
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,740
sku

468
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:54,500
you know whether it's little innocent

469
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:57,659
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cobalts or skeletons or purchase</font>

470
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:00,809
dragging you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different things you</font>

471
00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:03,510
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different pictures again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who who's</font>

472
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:06,540
who are always occupying your what

473
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:09,780
so I try to create some creatures<font color="#CCCCCC"> bento</font>

474
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:14,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and this is where you have</font>

your IDs or IPS is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your near antivirus</font>

your<font color="#CCCCCC"> seems you know anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a lot</font>

477
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,820
of collection any of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

478
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:25,290
things that are monitoring and watching

479
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:27,310
that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they may not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily</font>

480
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,110
unlike<font color="#E5E5E5"> the creatures in a dungeon which</font>

481
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:31,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">could actually literally more times than</font>

482
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,949
not these are going to just alert you to

483
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:38,700
the fact and somebody's there somebody

484
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:38,700
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming to kill you back so</font>

485
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,850
but in the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these pieces come</font>

486
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:49,210
together and so you get this this view

487
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:52,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">that where you know you're trying to get</font>

488
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:56,380
to a goal and that goal is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your treasure</font>

489
00:21:52,660 --> 00:22:00,970
right so a network this treasure could

490
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:03,670
be anything range if the person is going

491
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:05,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be attacking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your network is you know</font>

492
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,910
people we're going to fix your website

493
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:10,470
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you go well it is just your web</font>

494
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:14,370
server if if you actually have real

495
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:15,879
proprietary data or

496
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:17,799
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal</font>

497
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:20,829
personal information than the network

498
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:21,879
people might want then that was the

499
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:23,560
treasure

500
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,610
you know dozen dragons it's always you

501
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:30,300
know it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was troubled armor</font>

502
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">since for such a fine</font>

503
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,950
your goal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get something the other</font>

504
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:38,029
knows there might be more altruistic

505
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,759
management

506
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:45,429
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean in cold rain and use that as</font>

507
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:45,429
a side effect of coming lots of gold so

508
00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:53,949
so the fourth lesson using your

509
00:22:49,729 --> 00:22:57,229
imagination playing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> game great</font>

510
00:22:53,950 --> 00:23:00,259
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this map again how do you go from</font>

511
00:22:57,229 --> 00:23:03,679
pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of paper and little markers on</font>

512
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:07,129
there to seeing yet you know seeing your

513
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,169
team and senior<font color="#CCCCCC"> yorker come together and</font>

514
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:10,759
destroy a dragon we'd have to use our

515
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:12,679
imagination right if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any</font>

516
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:16,549
imagination Dungeons and Dragons doesn't

517
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:18,019
come from so what's the reality of

518
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:22,158
computers that ain't the very cliche

519
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:23,869
image but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you know when we</font>

520
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,549
interact with computer systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

521
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:28,099
electronics in general we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort</font>

522
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:30,769
of human usable interface right but the

523
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:32,899
reality is that human usable interface

524
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:35,379
is just a cover for what's actually

525
00:23:32,899 --> 00:23:35,379
going on

526
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:41,700
and this goes all the way down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to both</font>

527
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,120
working on computer systems to looking

528
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:50,090
at networking<font color="#CCCCCC"> trafficking my background</font>

529
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,090
of college was never<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and</font>

530
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,320
I I think

531
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:56,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">correction likes of the NM</font>

532
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,860
like where

533
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:08,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kirsten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> w but the reality is even that's</font>

534
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,900
not everything right I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> really is</font>

535
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,600
the physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer thing which mean</font>

536
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,790
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using that signal is sent in one</font>

537
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,399
of various methods right over ethernet

538
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:22,530
the voltages along the water or

539
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:25,230
modulated<font color="#CCCCCC"> to represent fits the you know</font>

540
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:27,149
wireless you know the signals signals

541
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:29,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">are changed amplitudes and frequencies</font>

542
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:34,110
in order to to accommodate the same the

543
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:36,750
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> concentrator so we have to in some</font>

544
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:39,810
ways abstract this because you know it's

545
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:43,770
not to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me before</font>

546
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:46,210
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> also leads to solving problems</font>

547
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:49,760
you know

548
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:52,220
two pictures again I like

549
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:57,650
so you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> keyboard not found press</font>

550
00:24:52,220 --> 00:25:01,280
f1 to resume or the using six different

551
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:03,550
adapters that you can put your<font color="#E5E5E5"> microSD</font>

552
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,550
card

553
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:09,190
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> ultimately you doing dungeons and</font>

554
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:11,469
dragons you you know whether you're

555
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:14,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">running into a trap or you run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a wall</font>

556
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:18,399
or something gets in your way to futures

557
00:25:14,499 --> 00:25:21,570
we're going you know we had an infosec

558
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:23,379
we have problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to celebrate</font>

559
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:25,520
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always work the way they're</font>

560
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:28,730
supposed to

561
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,990
through those high ball thingies address

562
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,990
was not sure

563
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,919
which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feeds it's nice into less</font>

564
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:39,529
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> five which is the elements a chance</font>

565
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:44,270
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever goes the way you expected</font>

566
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:46,500
you I think anybody who's ever worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

567
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:48,450
the computer is well aware that

568
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,000
even some of us who were the experts are

569
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:53,160
more small<font color="#CCCCCC"> fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something by magic break</font>

570
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,710
we don't know why wasn't working five

571
00:25:53,160 --> 00:26:00,510
minutes ago but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just did x and</font>

572
00:25:55,710 --> 00:26:02,730
outwards so done with dragons you know

573
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:05,100
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of show beginning you know one</font>

574
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:08,790
of the elements was all the dice and all

575
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:10,830
the table so everything the game is

576
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:12,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">based on this on the system of chance</font>

577
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:15,149
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a character sheet that</font>

578
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:17,850
has you know certain stats and points in

579
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:20,400
it but in the end or you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything you</font>

figure out over

611
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:52,870
end of this just working as well you

612
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:57,460
know anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can possibly go wrong</font>

613
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:59,169
with there's there's plenty of lists on

614
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet of work these laws of</font>

615
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:04,420
combat dragons anything else and there's

616
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:07,629
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as many for work</font>

who<font color="#E5E5E5"> have nothing to do in their free</font>

620
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,309

622
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,730
so the summer

623
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:33,750
so there's five lessons right it takes a

624
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:36,390
team having people who can work together

625
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:42,260
who have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> skills you can come</font>

626
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:42,260
together and together better than

627
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:46,509
the funny thing about it takes the team

628
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:51,129
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I probably took a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> longer life to</font>

629
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:51,750
learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> that limit ensure that we first to</font>

630
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:54,899

00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:07,740
