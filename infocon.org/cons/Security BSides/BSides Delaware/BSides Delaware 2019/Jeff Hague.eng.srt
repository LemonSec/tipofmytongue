1
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:18,110
all right oh good afternoon everybody

2
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,820
tall I should stay right here for the

3
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,130
video so I'll try not to walk around too

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,540
much hopefully you're here because you

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,970
have some type of interest they learn it

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,439
about mobile security if you're belper

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,918
from that side maybe you're building a

8
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,800
mobile studio Ram for your company I

9
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:36,620
think by ear with questions yeah don't

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,110
jump into things it's a big point away

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,940
nothing other than what I said X is that

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,019
your mileage is gonna vary everybody's

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:46,010
situation is different

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,539
that's kind of the going here I'm

15
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,489
usually not a fan of the Who am I slide

16
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:51,140
but I put this in here because it's kind

17
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:52,788
of screams a little bit about the

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,910
different types of scale you can work

19
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:57,400
with as we go

20
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:59,319
anybody was at a family business

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,809
especially it was kind of born into that

22
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,720
that was my first career small family

23
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:05,740
farms and agricultural stuff kind of

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,600
move from there into the software

25
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,600
development that's my first introduction

26
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:18,680
they're out there sticking with us theme

27
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,679
music all the messes with that

28
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:24,229
spent most of my career at a large

29
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:26,149
international bank so 19 years through

30
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:28,880
it a bunch of different stuff effective

31
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:30,829
with that time Jerry herbicides software

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,729
development got into architecture mobile

33
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:33,729
essentially mobile security

34
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,410
and have a little fun but what might

35
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,860
represent that from the vehicle

36
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,860
perspective

37
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:46,479
right now I'm at a bit sighs life

38
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:47,589
sciences company I will say because I'm

39
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,469
wearing the shirt and response in the

40
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,810
conference I'm a picky scientific seeker

41
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:56,548
there we've been there about four months

42
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,549
to get into a mobile security

43
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:05,580
like a vehicle's in between these two

44
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,580
somewhere Oh pick a nice car

45
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,030
all right so does letting will appear

46
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:14,609
the program has a couple different steps

47
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,500
here first thing is gonna be to know

48
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,690
your organization this is all the stuff

49
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,030
that's telling unique - doing what -

50
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,920
trying to do who are the people involved

51
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,319
what kind of budget do you have history

52
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,890
all that kind of stuff that's going to

53
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,420
be unique next is to identify the mobile

54
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,290
risk and spend the most time looking at

55
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,119
that

56
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,950
but you have that list identified then

57
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,459
you're gonna need to prioritize it what

58
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,458
you can work on

59
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,819
then quietly we'll see

60
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,190
there's a book people thinking about

61
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,640
city getting risk is the way to respond

62
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,870
to that

63
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,869
especially a bunch of different options

64
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,850
you think about this is that the very

65
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,739
first one I can't help you with it all

66
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:08,420
so if you came to hear about your

67
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:12,950
organization thank you I don't have to

68
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:16,149
get into your own space that's your

69
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,149
starting point

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,260
identifying mobile risk these are mostly

71
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,580
common to everyone look at a bunch of

72
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,170
different resources that are available

73
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,530
to you and you can see what state that

74
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,530
is

75
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,360
you

76
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,380
prioritising boat risks again that's

77
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,380
going to be

78
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:37,119
isn't that sorority

79
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,950
and with the risk

80
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,040
all right give some of people have heard

81
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,160
of us web application security project

82
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,459
sit around for a while we have a top 10

83
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,650
list

84
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,690
focus on the bedside is the W implies

85
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,370
you also have a mobile type camera

86
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,950
please that a couple years ago it

87
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,069
updated a couple times as a side note as

88
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:05,089
awesome as he lists

89
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:05,089
we use that as well

90
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,459
we're not going to run through all the

91
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:14,370
top ten here so this is one resources

92
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:18,019
you know - how she's a couple he's

93
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,019
saying some samples later on

94
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,980
people used to talk about mitre attack

95
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:28,159
as a framework putting more of analogies

96
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,270
especially it's like an inventory of

97
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,000
tactics techniques and they do have some

98
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,979
mitigation

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,620
with the 79 techniques this is a fair

100
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,740
amount of detail all the different

101
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,930
things

102
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,970
over the weeds you can attack won't

103
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,420
escape with that's when the device level

104
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,420
up yeah

105
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,119
that's that muttered or we'll get you

106
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,120
there

107
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,270
like use government actually has a

108
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,770
couple different publications though

109
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,200
nationalists to the standards and

110
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,560
technology of a fun place to read things

111
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,760
they have a couple things on mobile

112
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,660
setting the security mobile applications

113
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:12,120
it would be a resources Bakley who feel

114
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,550
a certain party application that's at

115
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,510
the station we need to take the same

116
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,510
principles on the part of that

117
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,189
catalogue is exactly what it sounds like

118
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:27,188
like the attack with

119
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:36,660
a couple years back

120
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,010
I would she years ago now Department

121
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,740
Homeland Security put out a study on

122
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:44,870
mobile device security pretty heavy read

123
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,870
a while but they cover

124
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:52,939
this was kind of a quick one but us

125
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,279
within anyway Center for Internet

126
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:57,860
Security has listed with these top 20

127
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:01,479
control not mobile-specific of these

128
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:08,499
lots of good principles in funny and

129
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:08,498
implies it was the goals these before

130
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,989
that's security the other work has that

131
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,550
all right this one workman's to list as

132
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:25,099
well throw in UDK she's gonna have to be

133
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,720
packed into it maybe a management read

134
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:27,590
about something in a journal or they

135
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,879
heard about something at a conference

136
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,878
and that was on you to do list

137
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:37,919
I'm a tissue

138
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:44,669
and other bunch of different variations

139
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,039
of both but basically learning by the

140
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:49,340
mistakes is what other companies do in

141
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,340
your face

142
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:00,400
all right so you know you know your Ord

143
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:03,639
we did identified a bunch of over risk

144
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,799
advertise what was kind of a couple

145
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:06,900
things

146
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,310
so one thing there that's hard to

147
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:13,429
everybody at some point is the Boston

148
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:13,430
store so you have to question

149
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,650
watch yourself

150
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,190
here implies that statistic I've heard

151
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,370
all the data that's stored on there is

152
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,370
what

153
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,510
I remember we have to use the data

154
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:37,210
stored about the operating systems but

155
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:40,130
and user starts to readily think about

156
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:42,590
I'm going to pop them with that

157
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:45,110
that's stuff like Wi-Fi passwords word

158
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,770
prediction list counts location history

159
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,770
all that kind of

160
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,080
that is a use of the device

161
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:59,020
and all the stuff that you contact a put

162
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,020
in there

163
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,008
Bumba list with chat after you use all

164
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,009
the ones that are out there

165
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:24,299
if you only asked what could be the

166
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,319
impact of all this it'll loss doesn't

167
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,679
get much of a mention but it's worth

168
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:32,119
putting on there yep device works

169
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:32,119
offline for whatever reason

170
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:41,750
see the disclosure intensity everybody

171
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:41,750
phone's going to be

172
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,930
you

173
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:51,280
but extras involved is going to be

174
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,280
well they would be

175
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:02,050
all right so we definitely can't slow

176
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:04,689
them advice would be one thing but offer

177
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,359
once someone has control of advices yeah

178
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:10,950
but nobody associated with that he plays

179
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,950
that's used for - spatula authentication

180
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,170
servus

181
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,950
no fancy but the person who has a device

182
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:24,030
and all of it has it

183
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:27,480
cell service conditions

184
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:30,390
looks like there could be one no I mean

185
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,620
person ate someone doing have to easy if

186
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:35,930
you have their device that can send

187
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,930
something from their account for that

188
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,300
that's a monetary loss for the device

189
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,360
itself and if you actually happen to get

190
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,849
the device back address lost now where

191
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,260
as possibility you know there's that

192
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,840
happens with some period of time with

193
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,750
the device wasn't

194
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,950
Oh your call

195
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,900
don't have a question about what

196
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:59,660
happened during that time maybe that's

197
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:02,079
where the device wasn't actual purpose

198
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,079
of the attacker

199
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,870
on

200
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,520
yes ask the question who bears the

201
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,520
impact sometimes it'll be the end user

202
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,530
so the department like this a couple

203
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,600
questions to ask ahead of time what kind

204
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:22,089
of places are these home by the

205
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,960
organization and we have all these

206
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:29,140
little devices or work with us and use a

207
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,880
little bit forward on devices or

208
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:33,870
past good requirement and grids how long

209
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,960
is it some of the other ones before

210
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,960
before yeah

211
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,969
the first question can I remove white

212
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,959
some of them

213
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,540
operating system versions on the device

214
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:52,829
isn't much to look at in a later example

215
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,829
gentle about the question

216
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,069
and recertification

217
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,140
when the loss actually happens is a

218
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,480
couple other questions

219
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,199
so as an organization that our first

220
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,910
warning device

221
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,279
I'll tell you would actually at that

222
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,890
point but it's actually stored on to a

223
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:17,860
specific device that was law guide your

224
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:20,069
response to that my question is still

225
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,070
there

226
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,880
all right second example going now where

227
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,160
I look at what this looks like

228
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,270
usually what's the third party app

229
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,810
stores and say that's a scary place

230
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:36,670
funky drafts they're also working at the

231
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:39,180
officials for instance we're gonna show

232
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,180
up there as well

233
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,089
you

234
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,560
now abusive permission is another thing

235
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,420
so there's apps out there that

236
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,849
may not do what they should be doing

237
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:02,469
with the questions that they have

238
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,470
of these efforts in getting done

239
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:08,540
here we for the Chad asset bubble over

240
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,890
at other applications going over in the

241
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,959
wraps

242
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,959
use that function over the entire screen

243
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:19,190
you log in each other after every fight

244
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,810
kind of the same concept with you the

245
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,100
resources so they can fight off your

246
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:26,329
network

247
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:28,550
suppose the loading adds our money for

248
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:33,490
the its owner same thing is a

249
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:33,490
cryptocurrency minor battery

250
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:40,839
after exploits os1 abilities look at

251
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,839
that little bit later

252
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:47,500
but I was an Android makes the top ten

253
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,560
top 50 products it has

254
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,560
you

255
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,820
profiles are nothing to look at just for

256
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,890
iOS but

257
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:06,020
there's just so many legitimate purposes

258
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:06,020
they have a phone

259
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,970
of a profile

260
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,689
debatable with this last one ready after

261
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,160
the for security or privacy practices

262
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:25,769
they have the same impact is how are you

263
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,399
though the pen isn't there I think the

264
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:28,399
kind of stuff we're down

265
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,860
how do you categorize that

266
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,649
as far as the impacts on here so we've

267
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,980
heard about ransomware it's a mobile as

268
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:47,600
well but out buta loss we'd access the

269
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:49,639
key logins and David Becker about Heinz

270
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,889
access has a couple different when Bruce

271
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,889
he counts fishing

272
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,640
other things we call surveillance where

273
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:07,170
we following in that privacy ball

274
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:10,939
category just be natural civilians where

275
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,939
you are family microphone type stuff

276
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,910
under the monetary loss side

277
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,640
same questions out there who bears the

278
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,900
impacts

279
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,010
mobile security program for your

280
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:30,090
organization you have to worry about

281
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,090
what comes back to you especially

282
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,230
you

283
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,760
we're out of time we're mostly the same

284
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,680
except for that last one of the top

285
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,020
session how am I going to check them out

286
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,979
more infection obviously though you know

287
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,949
could happen

288
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:47,040
I mean that come in first step but

289
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:51,649
effect it when it happens well it does

290
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,649
happen through a similar Lister question

291
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:58,800
especially illness OS vulnerabilities so

292
00:14:56,309 --> 00:15:01,519
here's the third one here guessing what

293
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,519
the rip does this is

294
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,990
speaker themselves every read about

295
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,640
things like executing arbitrary code

296
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,920
with kernel well privileges it's just

297
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,960
level privileges or awfully network

298
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,229
traffic data pretty much puts this

299
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,230
notebook

300
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,779
oh sure code whatever these after ten

301
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:32,430
look at the two

302
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:35,810
olessa cereal I was an Android

303
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,810
couple years is plenty of

304
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:51,489
questions here to ask ahead of time who

305
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:54,250
use this on any device I could have a

306
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:56,790
lot more leeway and we're seeing the

307
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,790
lightest offering

308
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,510
buffeted pieces

309
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,369
platforms that support

310
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,680
have a good answer to

311
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,610
operation system versions are currently

312
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:25,210
use if you're walking into a situation

313
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,210
where you know

314
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:41,849
I'm going to find a life version

315
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,790
I'll see this sp4 forward he's bigger

316
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:48,470
than fish national database rusher

317
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,469
around of these what

318
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,620
once you have that list how am I gonna

319
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:01,040
enforcer again I could just be through

320
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,040
policy

321
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:08,579


322
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:12,720
along with that or if you're talking

323
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:15,649
about this device or even controls at

324
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,650
the mobile application way

325
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:28,419
best example for prioritization is

326
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:28,419
middle attack risk here everybody

327
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,520
requested the state of disclosure and

328
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,940
that privilege that works positioning

329
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,940
the theater

330
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,520
in that position relations possibility

331
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:53,428
my first pet and then do the house

332
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:56,750
service but being that maybe less likely

333
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:56,750
but they should be following

334
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,159
so the

335
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,539
questions yes I'm here or what systems

336
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,470
my mobile apps talk to have some

337
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:19,220
networks my mobile device II biggies

338
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,220
data its Wi-Fi

339
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:31,370
well ever did is transferred so and

340
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,370
that'll tell you that

341
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:40,420
you handle bubbles that be here company

342
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:43,260
back to the food loss

343
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,260
how

344
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,940
all right so we go through that section

345
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:55,740
um we jump all the way into this

346
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:59,400
ecology opposes the friends you have

347
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:02,980
here three suicide you have all the work

348
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,760
with your tools offenders

349
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,760
partly

350
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,090
whatever

351
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:19,840
but though we have all the limitations

352
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:29,679
Fuzzy's makes the top of the list and

353
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,680
definitely places

354
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,020
Oh how much time

355
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,880
one that's all my different

356
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,620
pulse is worth the mention here just

357
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:48,080
because and every company's a little bit

358
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,360
different every was a specific could be

359
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,020
a group facility tight-knit and once the

360
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,560
hall problems around the world where

361
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,560
could be the place

362
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,980
you

363
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:06,509
oh he hasn't place right now are going

364
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,509
to be part of the equation

365
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,080
history associated

366
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,010
again if we go through the handling risk

367
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:27,590
well a couple examples and I put this

368
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:30,410
out on a continuum here all the way on

369
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:32,480
the scary side this one we use HTTP

370
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:35,950
acknowledge that's what we're using and

371
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,950
you'd have all the risk

372
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:42,670
a little bit better those using HCBS and

373
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,370
we go this completion a couple different

374
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:48,960
please quietly things like Gucci sale

375
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,959
and over with these with heart bleeds

376
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:56,340
it's to tell spooky scary side

377
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:02,490
a little bit for the river to do things

378
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,490
like sharing the risk

379
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,330
oh but it's do things a little bit for

380
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:19,210
the river I finish there's always an

381
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:22,060
option before you're buying good policy

382
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:24,120
you can risk

383
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,120
you

384
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,410
they're getting a little bit more on the

385
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,450
healthier side here like in the actual

386
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:32,840
reform certificate or gonna believe it

387
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,840
to get things

388
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:50,110
you transparency long-sought up in this

389
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:52,470
context again it's partially of reactive

390
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,469
control

391
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,000
especially

392
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:12,550
therefore gave some overlap okay so

393
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,550
that's active

394
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,439
and my share of the healthy side

395
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,929
the heavier the work size

396
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,210
we look at especially like this you can

397
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,440
have to decide where's the way spot

398
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:30,590
along the beach

399
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,590
how much

400
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,910
everybody

401
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:43,959
we've been transit at rest Haas here you

402
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,740
just go all the way on the ferry side

403
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,740
and say we're just gonna educate

404
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:57,029
nice encryption every modern mobile

405
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:58,769
device with that ability

406
00:22:57,029 --> 00:23:00,949
please do that you're doing something

407
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:00,949
but

408
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:09,960
some say that fibbing on farms

409
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,940
I've insurance disappearance again

410
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:17,160
that's just include there

411
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:22,340
device encryption but enforcing a trunk

412
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,340
ask again

413
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,890
cut across the bottom here is

414
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:37,090
application level encryption people if

415
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:41,159
there's a point that is being very good

416
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:41,158
but depending how you doing

417
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,129
so using the device right next to the

418
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,130
dealer

419
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,320
you

420
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:57,420
he's from the users own password I will

421
00:23:53,320 --> 00:24:00,659
do it once - baby of - and assure you

422
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,660
that's good

423
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:07,199
he sort of servers

424
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:14,479
authentication the better

425
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,480
and all the other side

426
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,139
you

427
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:27,420
well that's your development practices

428
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:29,610
other places with us will try and

429
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,790
capture data for you to their life

430
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,790
either

431
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,159
we're dealing

432
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,160
all right pretty secure codes another

433
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,900
way so if you're building an application

434
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,790
sorry about this so if you're getting

435
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,770
enough patience party

436
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:10,720
a little bit doesn't ask but you say

437
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:13,450
about that as well dude the bottom third

438
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,190
party and you have to poppy okay I

439
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,930
probably got a third party so we don't

440
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,970
have to worry about it

441
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:21,630
level protection but probably the

442
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,630
society bike

443
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,420
there's conditions that you want into

444
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:29,440
the contract that we were already got

445
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,440
Stevie the application

446
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:40,820
there's much options of popular to come

447
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:42,020
with anything bug bounty program

448
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,439
doing things like appalling human code

449
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:47,510
reviews and your social vulnerability

450
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,220
penetration testing all sorts of stuff

451
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,280
obviously the kind of partial

452
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:56,100
mitigations

453
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,100
or things to do we're looking at

454
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:10,120
distant oppression

455
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:13,139
Wow

456
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:22,170
you

457
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:26,060
so that's a good example there again but

458
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:26,060
how much is different between everybody

459
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,330
you can share a couple different things

460
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:31,330
away that are common to everybody

461
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,350
let's stuff together and help you file

462
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:35,350
that stuff

463
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:41,570
somebody example

464
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:02,249
stay on top of cybersecurity news is

465
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:04,379
another one I usually let this refer to

466
00:27:02,249 --> 00:27:07,649
mobile years install gears how much

467
00:27:04,379 --> 00:27:10,459
changes as much as that pace that I want

468
00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:10,459
to use this slide

469
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:16,299
we drove those updates nothing annually

470
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:22,500
my capabilities is kind of on that

471
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:22,500
puzzle as well so for policy changes

472
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:35,340
Catherine Sue's things like this these

473
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,360
are the kind of more periodic what they

474
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:42,080
happen after year things to watch their

475
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,080
Kalevala building disclosures

476
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,180
at hospitals also

477
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,060
watch it

478
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:55,860
clean up all these reducing for my fire

479
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,860
house but it's always flowing it

480
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,780
everybody here she kind of loses this in

481
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:06,190
an earlier talk today but knowing who

482
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,190
the smart people are will help you

483
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,299
all right we rather you're gonna be an

484
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:13,609
expert and everything bunch of the veins

485
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:15,168
that are out there and then an overlap

486
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:20,139
with mobile a little bit but you're also

487
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:20,139
pretty distant literally NASA's managing

488
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:29,639
let me do this my people are to go to

489
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:29,640
them input them selling a problem

490
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,399
you

491
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:44,120
we ran through this was a quick thought

492
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:44,120
I thought I would finally laid

493
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,399
you

494
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:12,120
yes great word I heard once the word

495
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:12,120
fragmentation team up these before

496
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:19,380
because looking at the OS versions that

497
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:21,840
are out there kind of depends whether

498
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,700
you had control of who advices nobody

499
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,669
buys them wash them down with MDM and

500
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,970
some users put a bunch of tiny speck on

501
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,970
that

502
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:39,549
and if it's you talking about with

503
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:42,940
employee situation the leeway in

504
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:45,090
defining that's like this to buy a new

505
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,090
surprise

506
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:51,889
you're making an app for the whole

507
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:55,000
market tail there

508
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,000
