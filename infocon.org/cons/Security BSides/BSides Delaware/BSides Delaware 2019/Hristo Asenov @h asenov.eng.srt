1
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:12,719
welcome everyone this is just to talk

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:16,769
about about a malware to call Carbonite

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:20,080
so what makes you guys in the right room

4
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:23,709
for 30 minutes today I'm going to be

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,698
talking about my journey and exploring

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:33,270
this hour that I thought was pretty cool

7
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:33,270
so we get started with dad and just

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,990
[Music]

9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:55,519
yes they're looking at me okay okay

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:58,220
great so my my name is Krista Seto and

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
the system software engineer all right

12
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:04,369
system software engineer at Rackspace

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:07,100
early before this is more related to my

14
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:10,310
previous employment which was at a

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:14,479
company called sir cadence and what they

16
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:16,280
do is they design a cybersecurity

17
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,860
virtual environment for learning

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,600
purposes so if you think there is a talk

19
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,850
earlier of the hack box

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,530
it's something similar to that face I

21
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:28,940
Connor on a bigger scale like though

22
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:35,990
build a whole a whole network of a red

23
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:38,270
team and blue team environments so in

24
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:46,640
case everybody a mine wants to again

25
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:50,090
touch and kind of related to those

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,149
circles they have a lot of red team and

27
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,770
blue team and the blue team be called

28
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:57,289
missions so they're cyber security

29
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:03,140
missions and they have things ranging

30
00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:06,740
from like doing spearfishing another one

31
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:09,860
the hair was on on ransomware like we

32
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:14,209
put like the watercress somewhere in a

33
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:19,069
mission and we always are trying to look

34
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:23,599
for new and exciting the malware so

35
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:26,179
we're looking for is for a mission that

36
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,540
dealt with banking transactions more

37
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:33,400
specifically if anybody hears familiar

38
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:36,260
there is a protocol about banking

39
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,900
communications how how transactions are

40
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,880
transferred and this is the protocol

41
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,650
that were looking at

42
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:47,500
the Swift protocol and uh you know a

43
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,420
couple of colleagues looked around and

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,870
look for different things and one thing

45
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:56,399
that kept popping up a lot with this

46
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,400
power called carbon tax

47
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:11,079
so some background on the actual malware

48
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:15,520
itself so it was I think actual attack

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:20,830
happen in 2015 so quite a while back

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:26,170
this happened however the the malware

51
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:28,180
itself is pretty complex and I really

52
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,769
they're like they have them been that

53
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:34,620
much information about it out there

54
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:39,700
there is a couple of resources are found

55
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:42,660
and so the first company that actually

56
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:45,280
disclosed this was first scale and

57
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:49,359
actually extermination their car Barak

58
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:53,650
itself it's mostly it has been found to

59
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:57,700
be president in in like the Eastern

60
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:02,170
Europe area including Asia areas around

61
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:07,679
there so Kaspersky was really the first

62
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,679
company to do analysis on earth and

63
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,370
and then a little bit after that

64
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,600
so here's the link focus first thing if

65
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,920
anybody needs to go back to it now by

66
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,239
the way this is going to be recorded so

67
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,930
you guys can you can just look at the

68
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:29,849
video later on but this is really first

69
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:33,330
write-up that came out and let me show

70
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:35,670
you guys what that looks like so they

71
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,229
just they came out with a PDF that was

72
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,150
more related to how the actual it's

73
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,160
happened they don't need to talk about

74
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:45,210
the intricacies of the malware itself

75
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,230
how it how it works on the inside they

76
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:50,370
talked about the community

77
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:53,070
communications protocol and what kind of

78
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:59,240
artifacts to look for to see if you're

79
00:04:53,070 --> 00:05:04,469
infected so for instance right here when

80
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:07,770
when infection and stuff happens it

81
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:10,340
installs a couple of files in Sirte

82
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,340
folders

83
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,870
so this is by the way this is all

84
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:21,540
windows this is all Windows Windows

85
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:22,860
based malware and so from that after

86
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,180
Lucas person came out with the report

87
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:32,640
then a Mahler analyst Pro far I analyzed

88
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:34,650
the actual binary and he came out with a

89
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:39,020
write of those extremely detailed and

90
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,020
very useful and

91
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:49,630
though his report is here so after that

92
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:52,300
happened the store scope was actually

93
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:55,680
found online it was found in some

94
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:59,020
pavement somewhere so it was very unique

95
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,400
relation where somebody analyzed the

96
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,250
buyer and then you have the source code

97
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,000
after work afterwards so another

98
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:09,660
researcher from far I went to the source

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,310
code and they compare notes and they

100
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,380
kind of talked about it in this block

101
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,650
and they have follow-up YouTube video as

102
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,650
well

103
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:23,349
so I thought that was really interesting

104
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:27,100
so if you see here if you look at the

105
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:29,110
block a lot of this stuff is a lot of

106
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,150
like comments in the source code I think

107
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,830
things like that are in Russian it's a

108
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:36,820
little helpful if you know Russian but I

109
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:39,460
mean yeah and I'll go through that later

110
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,860
on in this PowerPoint will look at the

111
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:49,359
actual UI it's it's like a Russian

112
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:51,850
language so so in that in the fire

113
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,060
record I from the fire report I really

114
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:58,660
wanted to get the environment working

115
00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:00,310
and I I kind of I kind of had a lot of

116
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,580
struggles with that actually get into

117
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:07,780
working and having it run in my system

118
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:11,070
so in this stuff that's kind of what I'm

119
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:15,609
going to talk about my journey Rome

120
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:18,250
again an actual source code dome and

121
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:21,340
diviner is to actually get it running in

122
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,500
my system so and then hopefully you guys

123
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:27,070
can benefit from that and you can take

124
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:29,620
take my work and analyze it further

125
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,210
because there's just there's a lot of

126
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,440
interesting things that are happening in

127
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,440
this malware I think

128
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:40,780
and the other two resources are so the

129
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,180
first two resources are more technical

130
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,039
they're they're more about like the

131
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:49,540
actual operation of the Maori everything

132
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:51,910
else now the two are more media they can

133
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:55,090
talk about the exported stuff in like

134
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:58,530
what actually happened so those are

135
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,530
interesting check out as well

136
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,950
so

137
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,430
yeah the actual malware itself right so

138
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:18,600
it has two component it's a remote

139
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:20,970
access Trojan meaning that it has on the

140
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,370
victim it has a binary that's executing

141
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:28,400
and it's talking back to your command

142
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:31,400
control server Sam is not exploit right

143
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,400
so

144
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:41,450
the yeah so running running cover itself

145
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,750
wasn't easy for me I had to do a couple

146
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:46,880
of changes in order to get it running

147
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:50,420
and I really really wanted to have the

148
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,510
source code and be able to compile that

149
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,430
because in our environment we we have a

150
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,439
lot of a lot of times we need to make

151
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,939
those different changes and we need to

152
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,350
tweak little things if you don't have

153
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,490
the source code you can't do that right

154
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:06,230
so we really wanted to be able to to

155
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:11,620
compile the sort of the source code

156
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,620
itself so

157
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:26,570
the bar itself it was it's it's written

158
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:28,519
in win32 C++ and I you know I really

159
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,230
wanted to do that to get a compile but

160
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,560
unfortunately I I didn't have success

161
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:40,339
with that so a lot of successful

162
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:46,479
actually compile the the actual win32

163
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:46,480
C++ code what I end up doing was

164
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:53,390
the dome contain the actual binary I was

165
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,220
able to figure out how that works and

166
00:09:53,390 --> 00:10:00,560
was able to get that running within my

167
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:06,440
system and I what I what it up happening

168
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,689
was I committed a some source code that

169
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,230
wasn't compiling for me and then when I

170
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:17,600
actually ran it it was giving me crashes

171
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:19,850
that were related to two dynamic

172
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,260
pointers if anyone is familiar with C++

173
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:24,410
they have something called small

174
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,000
pointers so they have that now dot

175
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:28,579
implementation what was actually doing

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,090
was it was implementing smart pointers

177
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:34,900
in the actual source code so it was it

178
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:39,110
was actually reading some smart pointers

179
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:41,579
and I think that was because the version

180
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:44,920
of

181
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:47,680
you know win32 they were using didn't

182
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,630
have smart ponies at that time so they

183
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,359
did this some kind of a weird stuff

184
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:58,510
where they really implement operators

185
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:01,780
you know so I mean if anybody's familiar

186
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:05,650
Morphin I'm not very not very familiar

187
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:07,240
with C++ I haven't really user if anyone

188
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:11,050
is familiar with C++ you know you can

189
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:14,260
definitely give it a give it a shot and

190
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:18,310
I I think I got pretty far as far as

191
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:20,620
that but I mean the binary that was

192
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,089
there work obviously so there must be a

193
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:28,380
way to compile it and there must be a

194
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:28,380
way to for it to actually work so

195
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:35,170
yeah so

196
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:37,180
once we we have the binary it was a

197
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,250
little bit complicated figured out how

198
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,670
it actually what actually needs to

199
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:45,310
happen in order for it to work so there

200
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:51,310
is a binary and there is actually a

201
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:56,770
separate executable which if you use you

202
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:58,750
use the binary as input into the into

203
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:02,380
the executable so it's a configuration

204
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:03,940
the configuration executable and what

205
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:09,400
will do this it'll rewrite the

206
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:14,490
executable you plug in its own values in

207
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:21,610
there so it'll insert the IP of the C&C

208
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:24,370
things like that and so there's a

209
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:29,320
there's a live version and there is a UI

210
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:32,950
a GUI version what you need to do is I

211
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:36,580
need to set it off right here I need to

212
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:39,730
start my my IP address right here and in

213
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:43,840
the configuration file and then if you

214
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:46,200
can see at the top all them use my laser

215
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,200
for

216
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:55,810
so right here I'm running billowed onyx

217
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:58,310
t-bot eat exceeded the input executable

218
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:02,239
example da config is the configuration

219
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:05,869
file which is this and ba-da-da bottom

220
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,720
score out is the output executable which

221
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,639
actually the the bottom the score out is

222
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:16,819
what actually used or executing the

223
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:20,079
actual binary right like I said it has a

224
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:20,079
good but it's not very good

225
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:30,320
the corner of this is not especially

226
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:33,800
good like you can tell that they did

227
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:38,990
really hastily like they something some

228
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:40,760
some some functions are are in this call

229
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,680
the stern way but they don't actually do

230
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,900
what they're called or you can see that

231
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,339
somebody like hold it one way then you

232
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:51,630
can change the functionality a little

233
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:56,959
bit inside so it's a little bit

234
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:58,980
a little bit weird in that sense so

235
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:02,939
that's one of the ways that you can

236
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:06,740
configure that a binary your ID the one

237
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,740
that Isaac used on the box yeah

238
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,920
that's a good question so

239
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:21,850
I especially I gotta from from the from

240
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,370
the dump what I did was there was

241
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:27,670
somebody else that had a github that

242
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:31,210
made he just did a made a github of all

243
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:34,120
the different artifacts and then I took

244
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:39,070
those artifacts and I modify them so if

245
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:42,790
we're looking at the source code I think

246
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:44,620
it's this thing and if they're actually

247
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,189
right here so this is actually a

248
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,190
beautiful

249
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:55,239
Oh

250
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,469
yeah this Russian so it's kind of hard

251
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:06,029
understand exactly says he needs like

252
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:10,430
Google Translate or something but I I

253
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:10,430
just all I did was I figure out that

254
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,750
the video hosts the video hosting is

255
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:22,610
what is the address of the actual CNC

256
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,410
alright so this song is don't make much

257
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:27,050
sense like video host you wouldn't think

258
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:34,939
that that's the CNC phone but you know

259
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:36,260
it works yeah obfuscation right so the

260
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,410
other thing I think that you need to

261
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,939
change is the password or a listen you

262
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:44,300
to know what the password is

263
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:48,070
so that you can you can you can

264
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,069
configure it after it's running

265
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:59,300
yes so so that's where I got those from

266
00:15:53,750 --> 00:16:01,610
yeah and so then when you're actually

267
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:05,270
running it what's also interesting is

268
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:08,540
that when it's when it's running you can

269
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:12,380
actually Rick reconfigure it while it's

270
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:15,550
running so it in Windows

271
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:17,930
I think instance of name pipe and

272
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:21,430
there's another program called batch

273
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:25,130
engine start that up it will set up

274
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:26,719
account between the binary and between

275
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:31,100
two batteries and you can essentially

276
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:34,930
configure it our way and there's this

277
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:39,080
little read me about the scene the

278
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:42,849
commands and also what's nice is that

279
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:47,560
his first two guys they provided

280
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:47,560
information about all different commands

281
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:59,310
they have stuff like RTP VPN VNC in

282
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:02,310
secession have a keylogger

283
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,310
somewhere

284
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:16,230
you

285
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:23,640
so that was that was the actual payload

286
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,148
itself the turning on on the actual

287
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,839
victim

288
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:30,719
now for the CSC as in c-sharp

289
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,970
that's a c-sharp application and I was

290
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,289
able together working with Visual Studio

291
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:40,500
2012 and I suggest all 2013 sorry

292
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:44,210
thousand thirteen and I suggest use a

293
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,210
version if you resist

294
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:52,750
and it's it's all the changes that I

295
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:56,560
made are actually on that github account

296
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:58,060
and I created a couple of videos rolling

297
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,340
through how actually made those changes

298
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:05,129
if anybody is interested in exploring

299
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:09,820
that but essentially what happens is

300
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:14,040
this booty right here pops up this this

301
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,040
is the server back in X Server

302
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:24,769
this right here is the bottom a connect

303
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:31,700
server and you see the line right here

304
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:34,119
for this is actual of the victim victim

305
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,119
binary

306
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:41,080
the IP addresses and then you have all

307
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:46,090
the different ways you can you can do

308
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:47,949
stocks in see RTP and the other

309
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:50,500
interesting thing is right here I have

310
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:55,330
prospects for of the top to the server

311
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:58,990
and then you can see right here there's

312
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:01,360
a solicitor known for number seven zero

313
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:03,250
zero and this is I think this is a zero

314
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,360
zero so it's so small and supports

315
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:10,380
server and in order to see here we have

316
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,379
establish connection

317
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,240
the victim

318
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:20,658
yes yes the boss and actually that was

319
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,539
first given if it has some information

320
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,740
about how it was encrypted another thing

321
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:26,960
that I needed to it should actually to

322
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,250
get it to work I am good thing thank you

323
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,270
for asking that question because I

324
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,710
forgot about that

325
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:33,309
another thing I ready to get it to work

326
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:36,890
was after you around that configuration

327
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:40,039
executable there's two files that get

328
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:42,289
dumped out of that to you two keys I

329
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:44,029
need to take those you need to to put

330
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:46,010
those on the server because otherwise

331
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:49,059
it's an incomplete connection story nice

332
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,059
thing is those in there

333
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,790
yeah

334
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:59,330
but I wouldn't imagine what it would be

335
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:01,740
too hard to figure out what those

336
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,840
especially like once you have this once

337
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,180
you cry out once I was able to modify

338
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,949
the server it was very easy like you can

339
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,860
just set breakpoints of the server and

340
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:14,090
you can see exactly what's going on you

341
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:16,800
can see what commands are going through

342
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:18,870
what what actually you know what it's

343
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,149
sending back and stuff like that so it's

344
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:23,629
pretty real easy to figure out once you

345
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,630
have that

346
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:38,678
I don't think they'd I don't think they

347
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,600
were doing that I think all they needed

348
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:42,809
to do that for this for my specific use

349
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,809
case

350
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,860
you know I think we do

351
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:53,850
want you back to the kaspersky paper

352
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,850
because it has a little mention of that

353
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:01,059
you know I actually I I don't I don't

354
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,550
have knowledge about how this actually

355
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:07,320
how the sniper was running on the actual

356
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:07,320
ATM software I have no idea

357
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:13,780
I just I was just able to get it running

358
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:16,590
for my own system but there's some

359
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:20,670
information hearing because Persky about

360
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,669
and what they were doing with them

361
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:25,418
ah

362
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:38,780
so so we had this send 100 port open and

363
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,370
we have 800 port often right so this is

364
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,440
actually there's another command you

365
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:45,080
need to run in order to actually control

366
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:48,200
this and it's called command CMD manager

367
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:51,949
and actually another command the system

368
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:55,030
communicates with server and once it

369
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:58,790
establishes a connection right here

370
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:01,520
you're able to do file transfer so I was

371
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:05,899
able to follow file chance right here

372
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:09,080
and I was able to execute commands so

373
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,770
it's exactly like a shell exactly like

374
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:15,129
lettuce body you know it's just the

375
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,129
sternest e sharp

376
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:25,389
so and there you have a bunch of

377
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:29,879
different things you can do on the

378
00:22:25,389 --> 00:22:29,879
actual victim itself

379
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,480
a little

380
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,679
a little bit harder to see but this is

381
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:47,059
already here and then you can start

382
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:48,770
socked here you can close RTP and other

383
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:52,940
stuff a lot of the stuff I don't

384
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:54,530
actually router because you kind of like

385
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,660
me sometime and or figure out what is

386
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:59,360
fun exactly what it does it's like I

387
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:02,870
said sometimes the bum doesn't actually

388
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,389
correspond to the action itself because

389
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:11,330
you know it's just that it's a weird

390
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:13,970
sort of project so we've done similar

391
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:16,428
stuff like this at sir cadence where we

392
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:19,690
had we have like all we have met us for

393
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:25,130
running and we needed to automate it so

394
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:27,770
we didn't we use the this board has this

395
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:29,660
remote procedure called protocol r15

396
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:32,960
protocol you can start out on the CEFR

397
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:35,030
pc and we're using that to essentially

398
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,850
automate Metasploit and are in our

399
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:41,030
project and I wanted to use something

400
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:43,340
like that for carbon as well so what I

401
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,899
did was I went and I looked through Sims

402
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,760
II manager that program that I just

403
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,910
showed I want to look through the

404
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:52,129
through the communications protocol and

405
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:55,910
just to see how it's actually

406
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:59,090
controlling C and C and I was able to

407
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:01,460
just do a little a very very quick

408
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:03,770
program in Python that will kind of

409
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:08,170
duplicate that behavior so like you can

410
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:08,170
see here I can get I can get

411
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,820
back in that here this is the back and

412
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:17,210
neck from the actual box this is my P

413
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:21,570
[Music]

414
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:23,970
and either the ports are open I don't

415
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:27,178
have much time to do much further than

416
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:30,570
that but I maybe I will go back and try

417
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:32,720
to actually get a better version the

418
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,720
work

419
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:45,269
oh yes so with that I just want to say

420
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:47,399
that there was a very interesting fire

421
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:49,590
especially on the victims side like what

422
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:56,008
the Vic what the victim Byron is doing

423
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:59,399
but I think also from from just signal

424
00:24:56,009 --> 00:25:03,710
on expect perspective how how the actual

425
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:06,209
carbon act our works all sensing as well

426
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:08,129
what I was sure there was doing was is

427
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:12,659
the privilege escalation because when I

428
00:25:08,129 --> 00:25:16,619
would see the process itself it would it

429
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:18,779
would run with the system it was running

430
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:21,389
a system and if there is something worse

431
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:23,460
its install itself as a service and

432
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:29,639
studying your system is very typical of

433
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:31,739
Windows Windows now where to do and it

434
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:37,289
is actually something that I would like

435
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:40,679
to go back to is so the far I guys did a

436
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:43,830
presentation and this is the list that

437
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:45,989
they have for for the for the export

438
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:48,480
that they were being used there nothing

439
00:25:45,989 --> 00:25:50,700
is nothing like zero days and nothing

440
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,919
too complex some the star they actually

441
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:55,409
stole from other projects like they

442
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:57,629
stole from wrapped from that exploit and

443
00:25:55,409 --> 00:26:01,559
I think they stole one from COBOL strike

444
00:25:57,629 --> 00:26:04,789
as well but it's just it would be

445
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,789
interesting to look at that

446
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:11,559
yeah so I have my you can you can get my

447
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:13,330
videos from my Twitter and uh yeah I

448
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:18,178
just want to say thanks to my colleague

449
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:18,178
star Mario and William

450
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:24,900
um yes so with that I'll turn up the

451
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,900
questions if anyone has any

452
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,100
you

453
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,470
you

454
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:48,090
yes I believe so because this the binary

455
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,480
that's executed of the victim itself it

456
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:54,270
was looking for certain processes that

457
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:58,050
are popular for bond banking

458
00:26:54,270 --> 00:27:01,490
transactions in those countries so there

459
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,490
was something similar to

460
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,909
like a little program that is then

461
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,910
little what's it called

462
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,260
you

463
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:43,690
yeah like in the movies

464
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,100
you

465
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:59,449
yes so if you go back to this video to

466
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,130
this source right here I think it's this

467
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:04,030
one there's a podcast that talks about

468
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,030
exactly that stuff

469
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,139
you

470
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,580
yeah

471
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:30,180
yeah just with something outta my way

472
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:30,180
here it's very interesting

473
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,409
you

474
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,770
you

475
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:44,460
yeah it's actually actually I can show

476
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:48,460
you right here

477
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:52,029
this is my actual victim here

478
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:54,220
and this is the CNC here that's running

479
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:57,159
I have a faucet right now

480
00:28:54,220 --> 00:29:00,940
what I would suggest is if you want to

481
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:03,960
do it you want to make sure that you

482
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:05,950
have your ever open a statistical slowly

483
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,500
you want to make sure you do it in that

484
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:11,940
right just one can't stress that enough

485
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:15,549
but yeah that's what I was doing I was I

486
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:19,289
had I had this is my victim and this is

487
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:19,289
my my scene see here

488
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:28,340
you

489
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,080
yes I was and I was able to find that

490
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,710
file actually that file that they were

491
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,070
talking about

492
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:42,149
I found out every single time a very

493
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,149
good indicator of compromise

494
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,700
Oh

495
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:58,619
yeah

496
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:01,570
well I think I think my time is well

497
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:05,139
