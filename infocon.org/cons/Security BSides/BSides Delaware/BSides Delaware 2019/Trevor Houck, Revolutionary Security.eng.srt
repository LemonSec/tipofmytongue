1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,379
and dive dive straight into this I know

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,799
no you guys have a lot of other options

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:13,139
for talks and workshops or abilities to

4
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:16,800
the answer thanks for coming coming to

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:19,890
this talk my my name is Trevor Hawk I've

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,680
had the opportunity to work in a various

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,650
number of cybersecurity roles in my

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,320
career I started out as a systems

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,709
engineer at lock at Lockheed Martin

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,379
doing a lot of secure system design on

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,750
some cloud and cloud environments for

12
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:39,649
various government customers and I

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,410
started working more as a cyber security

14
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:45,960
analyst for cyber force our commands I

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,319
had just so many opportunities to to

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,440
learn and opportunities to expand and

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,739
then I that that for a for a couple

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,410
years I gravitated more towards a

19
00:00:54,739 --> 00:01:02,239
towards a penetration testing role I was

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,319
able to do that in both the IT and

21
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,630
corporate environments and then more of

22
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,428
the industrial ot environment which

23
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,999
which will dive into here a little bit

24
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:14,810
more and I've seen a lot of examples of

25
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:18,089
Sox those security operations center

26
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:21,119
working in both the IT and OT

27
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,609
environments and I've seen a lot of a

28
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,590
lot of companies doing it really well a

29
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:28,380
lot of companies doing it not so great

30
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,039
so I really had the opportunity to kind

31
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,689
of pick and choose that's the best

32
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:35,639
practices in each model and I just

33
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,898
wanted to kind of above it aggregate all

34
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:41,789
that all that experience knowledge

35
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:43,770
together present this before we do that

36
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:46,469
I want to give a little overview of

37
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,359
myself in my spare time when I'm not

38
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:49,678
looking through firewall walls and

39
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,649
flying to incidents I enjoy the

40
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:55,889
woodworking so it's nice to just take a

41
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,840
step back from all the technology and

42
00:01:55,889 --> 00:02:01,949
work with your hands either some of the

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,679
projects that bill mostly at my wife's

44
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,550
direction for for furniture around the

45
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:11,520
house and so it's a nice nice way to

46
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:14,400
detach so if you're anything like me

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,590
when I started my career I started a

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,540
company called law

49
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,940
Lockheed Martin and then we were sold

50
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,310
off to another company called Wyeth and

51
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,400
then we had we the opportunity kind of

52
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:29,340
create our own company of revolutionary

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,920
security and when I started with them we

54
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,200
were doing both itno t work and I

55
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,869
started my interview and they asked me I

56
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,660
was like what's over T I have no idea

57
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,849
what it is I know what ideas and so I

58
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:47,069
kind of wanted to kind of set the set

59
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:50,100
the page here to kind of go over the IT

60
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:52,100
all of us we're all here at IP security

61
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,739
conference there it's gonna be the

62
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:58,799
computers servers file servers VoIP

63
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:00,390
phones networking infrastructure that's

64
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:03,299
really used in a in a corporate

65
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,250
environment to process and store data or

66
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:09,630
if you're home with your xbox to play

67
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:12,390
Halo where as ot is gonna be more

68
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:15,569
focused on control system Hardware is

69
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:20,488
kind of perform certain control

70
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:23,220
functions example we all have our houses

71
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:25,769
or apartments as a thermometer we we use

72
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,359
that thermometer to set up a certain

73
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:29,850
temperature of like what we want the

74
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:32,579
house to be and that that setpoint is

75
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:35,250
going to determine how hard our HVAC

76
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:38,100
system is going to pump out air whether

77
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,350
it's colder or higher and how long it's

78
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,420
going to do it for until that sensor

79
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:45,450
that thermometer reaches that at that

80
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,750
point another example is a simple garage

81
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:50,608
door opener or any any smart home

82
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,549
devices you have Smart Switches smart

83
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:56,639
plugs there are kind of really small

84
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:59,700
small examples of a control system order

85
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:02,840
and this over here is an example of a

86
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:06,149
PLC a programmable logic controller

87
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:09,410
those are gonna be used to really

88
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:14,780
control real time process functions and

89
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:18,350
chemical actions in a in an industrial

90
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:20,870
context you're you're gonna see ot and

91
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:26,150
like a power plant

92
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:29,020
or hydroelectric dam or new nuclear site

93
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:32,090
site operations and you're gonna have

94
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,549
operators or engineers working on on HMI

95
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,888
that are going to be monitoring like the

96
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:39,650
flow of water flow of electricity I mean

97
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:44,300
able to respond to those different life

98
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:48,650
life situations in that arena I kind of

99
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:50,810
wanted to go over what what the how ot

100
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,698
met network topology has been in the

101
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,330
past and kind of where we live the

102
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:58,880
current state I'd say probably a deck

103
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,039
yeah a decade ago or past they've been

104
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,580
trash and air gap or should have been

105
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,979
air gap where you saw these systems that

106
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:11,150
are isolated from your corporate

107
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:16,090
networks or the internet they're gonna

108
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:16,090
be standalone and environments with

109
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,570
there's been more of a shift towards

110
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,370
kind of stepping away from the

111
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,190
completely air gaps and the more

112
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:28,150
connectivity in the name of efficiency

113
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:31,700
so you have the introduction of

114
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:34,280
third-party Internet connections set up

115
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:42,229
by hard hardware vendors to go in there

116
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:44,960
and monitor or maintain or you you see

117
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:48,219
more connections moving into the

118
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,560
corporate net Network environment so

119
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:55,160
ok-kk monitor metrics or performance

120
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:58,370
about how this and industrial is working

121
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:02,000
and obviously with that with the growth

122
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:05,180
of those new connections there's going

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:11,240
to be an increase in the amount of cyber

124
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:13,720
security concerns connections so I

125
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,510
really wanted to kind of highlight the

126
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:20,389
progression of ot or ICS both from our

127
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:22,490
ICS is industrial control system for

128
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:27,169
this talk you can think about them so

129
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:29,630
obviously in 2010 we our first example

130
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:32,859
that really put it put on the mat with

131
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:34,550
Stuxnet this was the first example of

132
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,160
computer code

133
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:40,580
that caused damage to a physical device

134
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,699
it wasn't just a matter that was

135
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:46,280
stealing your data order or an anchor in

136
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:52,520
Europe it was causing physical

137
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:54,530
destruction the hands Iranian it

138
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,330
contained a number of zero days that

139
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,830
exploited a Windows system and once the

140
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:02,330
Windows system was exploited it was able

141
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:04,370
to exploit a Siemens PLC for their their

142
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,590
program logic controller which which

143
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,500
controlled the mechanical actions of a

144
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:13,099
centrifuge and and what the Malheur was

145
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:15,940
doing was that it was it was spent

146
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:19,009
spinning the centrifuges really unsafe

147
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,199
had unsafe intervals it was telling the

148
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:27,039
system operators on the HMI that are

149
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:30,169
that were monitoring it okay when

150
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:38,750
reality it actually halted the nuclear

151
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:42,710
operation so it was it was unprecedented

152
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:51,620
at the time and it was and the delivery

153
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:57,799
vector was a simple USB connection the

154
00:07:51,620 --> 00:08:00,050
next was 1/2 X and 2014 this leverage

155
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:05,419
tenon and the industrial protocol called

156
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:08,449
OBC was the open platform controller

157
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:14,690
which is basically used to scan a

158
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:16,639
network and in this case it was

159
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,770
specifically looking for hardware

160
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,469
related to Rockwell Automation or

161
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:24,380
Siemens Hardware those are those are two

162
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:27,050
major players in the in the OT industry

163
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:30,710
as it was it was really fine to and

164
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,060
enumerate that and it it targeted

165
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:36,020
multiple different industries that

166
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:38,699
targeted energy aviation pharmaceutical

167
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:44,699
and defense primarily and

168
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:46,649
and the Europe and the delivery doctor

169
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,709
for this the hackers didn't directly

170
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:53,000
attack those companies but instead they

171
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:55,800
attack the vendor website the website

172
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,410
and compromised those websites and

173
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:03,300
injected their own malware masquerading

174
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:04,560
as operators and engineers on the power

175
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,819
plants were thinking they were just

176
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,079
updating normal but they were actually

177
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,370
downloading malware thong and giving

178
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:16,829
hackers access to those association and

179
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:19,920
operating the coordinate we had crash

180
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:21,779
override in a store in 2015 five fact

181
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,120
this is called two different names the

182
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:28,050
entire industry calls it in destroyer

183
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,540
but all dragons that's that's really

184
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:36,959
heavily in the OT space they call it

185
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:39,420
crash override as hackers there's such a

186
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:46,469
big player and the in the industry that

187
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:49,140
we just call them both and in 2017 we

188
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:52,410
had threatenin crisis this was the first

189
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,350
time that we saw now are specifically

190
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:58,740
targeting safety systems in these

191
00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:04,019
industrial environments now when when we

192
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:07,350
have humans working South's a very very

193
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:10,290
dangerous environment temperatures

194
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:13,800
hovering temperatures of batch processes

195
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:15,689
going out this count countless numbers

196
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,519
of opportunities for harm to human life

197
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,529
and they and there's hardware

198
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,640
specifically designed called the safety

199
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:25,980
instrument system or SAS to prevent harm

200
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,810
or death of humans but this malware was

201
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:32,430
specifically targeted to override the

202
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:36,170
safety protocols in that hardware and so

203
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:39,739
that was obviously a really big big deal

204
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:43,920
really just wanted to highlight that of

205
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:45,779
the ever growing OT threat landscape to

206
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,360
really paint a picture of me

207
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:51,620
oh the obvious need for these modern

208
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,700
response capabilities

209
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,350
traditional socks you know you think

210
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,940
thank you our traditional IT sock

211
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,490
they're gonna have almost full

212
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,660
visibility into everything I write

213
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:09,450
they're kind of like in charge of

214
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:11,520
everything from the server they want

215
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:22,380
alright but but if you're a company that

216
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:24,420
also is not always a case that your IP

217
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,720
sock is gonna have the visibility those

218
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:30,000
types of environments and it's hard for

219
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,180
you as the as a sock to say I have the

220
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
mission to protect to protect my entire

221
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:37,469
company's enterprise from cyber security

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,610
threats when you have zero visibility

223
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:44,010
into into your operational environments

224
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,320
there's this there's just too much of a

225
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:48,990
possibility of actors hiding in those

226
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,970
environments and oftentimes if if you're

227
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,240
a company like if you're if you're a

228
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,740
pharmaceutical company you're the main

229
00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:00,480
like business driver for you is the

230
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:02,580
manufacturing of and so that's going to

231
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,710
be an obvious target for hackers that

232
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:07,170
they wanted to drop your business

233
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:10,410
operation they're gonna be where your

234
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:13,110
crown jewels are another way to combat

235
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:16,170
this threat landscape is a collaboration

236
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:19,380
between IT teams and I don't say that

237
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:21,420
like that right like we I know that it's

238
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,390
much easier said and done especially

239
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,490
when you start to consider you might

240
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:32,010
think that both of these teams might

241
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:33,450
have competing priorities but it's I'm

242
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,730
gonna get into this later on they're

243
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:39,420
talking kind of approaches I found work

244
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,500
to kind of bridge that gap but I think

245
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,780
it's important to realize that this is

246
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,820
no longer should we do this should we

247
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:47,730
collaborate the communities but it's

248
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:52,710
more of a let's find the best way to do

249
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:56,690
this and third I found that a lot of

250
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:58,770
companies try to apply traditional

251
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,410
security monitoring approaches to this

252
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:04,090
and and it's at some some successes and

253
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:06,610
some some shortcomings but

254
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:09,580
I think in general that the traditional

255
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:11,380
approaches include isolated efforts that

256
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:15,760
aren't really holistic I want to kind of

257
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:23,230
dive in to really illustrate what I've

258
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:30,610
seen different companies summarize all

259
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:32,770
what I've seen in integrated I dedicated

260
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:36,900
or a hybrid approach and each approach

261
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,900
is gonna have their their pros and cons

262
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:43,689
this integrative approach this is my

263
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:46,840
favorite approach this is where you have

264
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:49,900
your your physically combined itno t

265
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,730
sock space gonna have your your ID stock

266
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:55,930
analyst sitting with your Okazaki

267
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,880
analyst site side-by-side physical space

268
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,829
share physical space you have your your

269
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,080
dashboards to the screens on the wall

270
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:03,880
that that that used to impress all the

271
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,850
executive company but you don't actually

272
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:10,240
use in a security incident you're always

273
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:13,990
working on their own desktops your

274
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,510
shared words a better gun going to be

275
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:19,200
displaying information and data from

276
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:21,700
both your IT and enno team wrote

277
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,520
technologies and with that you're also

278
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:27,040
gonna be able to cross trainer analyst

279
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,810
you're gonna be able to create instant

280
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:40,410
response processes better tailored to

281
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:42,939
both and ideal well it's challenging

282
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:46,390
what are some of the challenges we've

283
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:48,160
had to work through our finding finding

284
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:54,130
cyber security analysts that are really

285
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:55,870
good usually a lot of people who have

286
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:58,270
those skills are very happy in their job

287
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:02,290
so it takes a lot of convincing to get

288
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:04,840
them to to move move over the other

289
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,880
approach that is the beginning to cross

290
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:10,210
cross trying analysts and in the OT

291
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,610
domain knowledge other challenges is

292
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:14,650
creating processes that that work for

293
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,060
both both domains it can be a lot a lot

294
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,470
to overcome especially when you're

295
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:21,459
talking about interest

296
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:23,560
regulation and political norms and

297
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:27,910
battles say that I have to fight through

298
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:31,300
and also avoiding information overload

299
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:33,310
with with aggregating log log sources

300
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:36,520
from both your IT and ot and

301
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:38,229
environments the other approach I've

302
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,290
seen people take as a dedicated approach

303
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:44,050
where you have your your IT sock you

304
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:46,120
have your ot sock your ot analysts are

305
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:48,640
only monitoring traffic from the

306
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,680
perimeter down down to endpoint devices

307
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,780
and you have your IT sock where you're

308
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,800
monitoring only traffic from your

309
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,689
network perimeter down the endpoint

310
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,609
devices and not looking at any kind of

311
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,770
lateral movement in between the two

312
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,820
environments they're gonna be physically

313
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,890
separate you're gonna have separate

314
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,560
dashboards separate analysts separate

315
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,760
skillsets and really the only time you

316
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,939
begin to integrate is when there's a

317
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:13,860
really serious threat and and obviously

318
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,860
that's not ideal I was it's ideal for

319
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:19,750
addressing the incident higher up in the

320
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,280
kill chain right not not down down low

321
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:25,930
when they're when they're working on

322
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:28,750
data or or command control and then I've

323
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:31,030
seen the to be a hybrid approach where

324
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,040
it's kind of like a la carte option of

325
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:34,720
like I'm gonna choose this part of the

326
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,949
dedicated model or this part of the

327
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,860
integrated model I'm not gonna do this

328
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:41,650
and it was trying to combine just like

329
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,840
certain functions and then maybe you

330
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,520
might have analyst shadow shadowing in

331
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,010
the other sock but there was never

332
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,530
really like all an approach for an

333
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:54,490
integration so I never really seen it

334
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:57,069
worked well work well and I think I I

335
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:59,020
alluded as to why I think the the

336
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,490
integrated approach well works well so I

337
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:04,180
just want to kind of expand on that a

338
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:06,370
little bit we've found a lot of improved

339
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:09,490
situational awareness in these

340
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:13,479
environments when you have a well

341
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:15,430
structured sock operating model things

342
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,699
just there's gonna work well when you

343
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:20,860
have your detection sources aggregated

344
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:23,290
together in a central sim so you're able

345
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:26,229
to do some real advanced or advanced

346
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:29,200
correlation you're gonna have your your

347
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:31,060
co-located IT and ot cyber security

348
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,070
analysts you're gonna have that

349
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:36,159
domain knowledge at a real real easy

350
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:37,689
access know and when when you're sitting

351
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,550
next to someone it's gonna be a lot

352
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,750
easier for you to be like hey do you see

353
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,639
what I'm working right now like what's

354
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,590
what's your opinion on this based off

355
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,730
your domain knowledge instead of instead

356
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,679
of picking up the phone and calling

357
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,210
someone and you might think I don't want

358
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,010
to bother them with this when in reality

359
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,390
like that might be the simple phone call

360
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:55,270
that could have prevented the next

361
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:57,790
infection into your teen varmints so

362
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,950
just having that the the the access to

363
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:04,420
that knowledge co-located with you just

364
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:06,970
makes for so much more for it allows for

365
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:09,850
faster event correlation and remediation

366
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:12,040
which which brings us into the quicker

367
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:15,760
response times when you're when you have

368
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:20,110
your holistic approach to be able to see

369
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,540
the entire enterprise and different

370
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:25,209
tools were reporting in it's gonna make

371
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,560
it so much faster be able respond

372
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,210
because when you're able to see oh I

373
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,060
don't have to call someone to ask for

374
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:33,100
proxy logs over here or access logs to a

375
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:35,139
field component I can see this all real

376
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:39,280
time and I don't have to waste time with

377
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:42,040
the my new show process it's going to be

378
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,800
able to prevent a delays and incident

379
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,080
remediation also its cost-efficient this

380
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,850
is one of the biggest biggest sellers if

381
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,490
you're trying to win top top level

382
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:53,199
support you're gonna be able to combine

383
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:56,560
management structure is gonna be able to

384
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,450
combine physical spaces and I think if

385
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,580
done correctly you're able to reduce the

386
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:02,670
cost of yours two security stack if

387
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,480
you're able to use technique two

388
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:07,780
technologies and these different

389
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,970
environments that we talked I talked a

390
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,740
lot about why this is awesome and you

391
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,180
might think wow this is this was really

392
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:17,050
cool but there's no way I can ever do

393
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:19,480
this in my in my my environment but I

394
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:23,590
want to kind of go through some some

395
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:26,350
examples or what we found works best to

396
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:29,379
kind of get us there towards this path

397
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:31,209
of integration I know it doesn't sound

398
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,730
sound sexy but one of the first things

399
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:37,420
to do is to understand your your

400
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:41,380
baseline so really really taking time to

401
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:43,410
to understand how your organization is

402
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:46,120
set up

403
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:48,040
understand reporting structures so

404
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,050
really they think of it from a RACI

405
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,899
matrix point of view think of functions

406
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:55,570
think of positions who's in charge of

407
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:58,780
what understand what what your current

408
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:03,570
snapshot is same thing with your tech

409
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,570
with your technology stack question

410
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,030
you

411
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:30,879
i their their absolute absolutely

412
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,080
challenges to to go through especially

413
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,480
when you you're talking about

414
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,899
traditional IT analysts aren't gonna be

415
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:41,350
as familiar with a packet capture let's

416
00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:43,350
say ZigBee traffic or where my Modbus

417
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:46,779
traffic or or knowing how to read a

418
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:48,639
syslog file that's and think that's kind

419
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:50,350
of where we have the cross

420
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:53,289
cross-training come in and come into

421
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:56,168
place and being able to understand the

422
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:58,990
the norms or base lines of each

423
00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:03,759
environment but well will I dive into

424
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:06,519
that deeper to later on and so really

425
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:09,309
when when when you begin to understand

426
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:11,169
your snapshot for your or your or your

427
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:14,918
current snapshot of your organization

428
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:17,820
your them your limitations in your tech

429
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:20,129
technology and your security stack

430
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:23,019
you're gonna be put in a much better

431
00:21:20,129 --> 00:21:25,750
position to understand the gaps that you

432
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:27,279
have and be able to you know it's kind

433
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,960
of like a you don't know what to fix

434
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:31,600
until you know it's until you know

435
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,840
what's what's broken sort of approach to

436
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,769
help you better understand your your

437
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,799
capabilities and your process and

438
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:41,799
technology gaps second is your vision

439
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,769
now I say I say the integration approach

440
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:47,918
is is the industry best standard

441
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:50,950
approach there you might have some real

442
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,929
tough tough battles to fight at the

443
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,730
corporate level at the top top level you

444
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:57,820
know mine works best

445
00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:00,340
I would I would Lobby to say have a

446
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:04,178
vision of of integration and work

447
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:06,039
towards that and see not not a I like I

448
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:07,990
like to follow the approach of wow it

449
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:10,509
before you how it say wow that's a

450
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,889
really good idea let's see how we can

451
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:13,659
make that work instead of instead of

452
00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:14,918
hearing idea be like I don't know how to

453
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:17,909
do that so that's gonna be impossible

454
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:20,080
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna even try

455
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:22,299
here's where you're really gonna map out

456
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,009
your your like you had your baseline

457
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:26,620
RACI of roles responsibilities now that

458
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:28,509
you're combining functions plan out a

459
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,389
new race II like who's going to be in

460
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:35,260
charge for what talk about processes and

461
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:37,120
responsibilities in integration with the

462
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,010
business

463
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,649
next is the is the plan this is where

464
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:44,530
it's gonna be a little more in the and

465
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:48,120
Andy gritty text actively but see okay

466
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,120
if we're gonna have a shared

467
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,320
responsibilities different sources into

468
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,670
one central environment and there's

469
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,189
gonna be things you have to overcome

470
00:22:54,670 --> 00:23:00,460
like like industry regulation there's a

471
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:02,290
lot of electric utilities I work for but

472
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,690
there there was had to there was a lot

473
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:08,889
of work had to go around just sending

474
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:11,559
logs from from an endpoint device sorry

475
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:14,500
it was just a simple come it was a

476
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:17,770
Windows 10 server but it was operating

477
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:20,410
on it was operating in front of Quitman

478
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:22,450
I was controlling the electrical grid

479
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,440
so there was a lot of compliance that we

480
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:26,380
needed to work through to send those

481
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,210
logs over to a non protected space in

482
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,470
the corporate environment it was able to

483
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,600
be done but not without a lot of

484
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,880
challenges and so once we had that we

485
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,379
just had so much more visibility into

486
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:40,360
those operating spaces I identified log

487
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,179
log sources you're gonna have your

488
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,550
application and an operating system logs

489
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:47,230
from so from a lot of the IT

490
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:49,720
infrastructure that's going to be in the

491
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:51,940
OT environments that network

492
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,000
infrastructure your HMIS your operator

493
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:58,809
workstations time servers process data

494
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,220
and telemetry from satellites or a field

495
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:02,440
field devices that are time to are

496
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,000
important using all that to aggregate

497
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,530
events in your corporate and your

498
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,080
corporate soccer just kind of it's going

499
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:12,670
to be very awesome when you start to

500
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,379
when you're playing when you're able to

501
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:16,240
write rules in your in any kind of

502
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,530
central sin that you have to have to

503
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,429
aggregate and correlate all of these

504
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:24,070
close data and here to in this plan

505
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:27,910
approach I've found that it's it's easy

506
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:29,700
to look at the let's let's go find a

507
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:34,000
tool to give us the latest greatest

508
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:35,980
detection Zoar or let's let's pay for

509
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,840
this really cool threat right a threat

510
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,789
Intel feed

511
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,649
but one of one of the things I really

512
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:43,899
like to kind of hit home when when at

513
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:45,849
this stage is like let's instead of like

514
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,678
let's instead of trying to run let's

515
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:49,859
just learn how to walk in this new kind

516
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,779
of environment so I like to take a back

517
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:54,820
back to the basics approach and I know

518
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:57,489
the kids on reddit these days are saying

519
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:59,080
okay boomer when talking talking about

520
00:24:57,489 --> 00:25:01,359
stuff that's been been done in the fast

521
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,340
old methods but well that's okay you can

522
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:06,070
call me you can say okay boomer to me

523
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:08,799
but I found that following these these

524
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:10,899
steps I've never led led me astray and

525
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,918
as has really said a lot of people out

526
00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:13,869
for success

527
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,359
that's it management I know it doesn't

528
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:17,859
sound sexy it sounds boring but when

529
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:19,779
when you're able to do this correctly

530
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:22,359
you're gonna be set up set yourself up

531
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:24,549
for so much more success when you're

532
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:27,369
ingesting through things like that sexy

533
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:29,440
thread all right Intel feed when when

534
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:33,488
when you're able to group systems and

535
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,589
into logical divisions so you know that

536
00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:39,789
like okay and this in this in this

537
00:25:35,589 --> 00:25:42,129
organism I wind owes 10 servers in this

538
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:44,529
subnet I know they're this this patching

539
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:47,228
level okay you might look over here and

540
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:51,159
your roti environments is saying this is

541
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:54,009
I have all this siemens step7 hard

542
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:56,769
hardware running on this this four more

543
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:58,509
version okay so that when when I get a

544
00:25:56,769 --> 00:26:01,690
tip from my threat Intel feed and they

545
00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:03,309
say oh you this this firm from where is

546
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:06,219
out-of-date this firmware is vulnerable

547
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:07,869
I don't have to go through and and worry

548
00:26:06,219 --> 00:26:09,669
about scanning my entire system to try

549
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:16,959
to find this Rimmer I already know and I

550
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:19,690
can the next next basically like Apollo

551
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,769
is a vulnerability scanning if you have

552
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,119
really good asset management

553
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:23,469
I wouldn't even I wouldn't do any

554
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:27,149
vulnerability scanning and your ot

555
00:26:23,469 --> 00:26:27,149
button before you have asset management

556
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:42,840
yes yep yeah it's all it's there's

557
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,840
there's obviously some concern about

558
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:49,240
more around industry compliance and like

559
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:52,210
there's like there's there's one utility

560
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,740
I would work for that it's good to have

561
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,019
a government clearance to be able to

562
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,190
have access to some of the equipment so

563
00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:59,139
there's a lot of sensitivity around

564
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,399
there and I think that that company's

565
00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:02,769
approach was to get everyone in the saw

566
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:04,570
it cleared so that it basically turned

567
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:06,429
in turned in to ask if they had to have

568
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:08,260
access to get in the sock but everyone

569
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:11,019
who who was able to step foot in the

570
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:15,870
sock was was cleared by the DoD or sorry

571
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:19,649
ideally so with vulnerability scanning

572
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:22,570
there's a lot of times where I've seen

573
00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:25,809
corporate our corporate scans from the

574
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:26,830
IT environment traverse into the OT

575
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:28,840
environment because it wasn't proud

576
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:31,059
although we segregated and a lot of this

577
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,439
equipment is old legacy stuff that isn't

578
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:34,480
designed to handle traffic it of them

579
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,750
know and so it knocks it over and you

580
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,210
halt operation and that's a real

581
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:47,529
relationship breaker but between IT and

582
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:50,110
ot right so if you yeah it's your your

583
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:52,720
stuff them off yeah so don't don't

584
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:54,879
blindly throw your your own your

585
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,139
vulnerability scanners over to the ot

586
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,590
environments you will break something

587
00:27:56,139 --> 00:28:00,908
and you will break for relationships

588
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,559
like I said before it have it into

589
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:05,200
logical groups so that if you want to

590
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,450
conduct scan you know exactly what you

591
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,289
need skin we need to scan and it's going

592
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:14,080
to allow you to have quicker scans and

593
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:17,919
more efficient scans more targeted you

594
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:21,370
can make it the it's gonna be secure

595
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,580
architecture design there's this model

596
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:26,709
called the Purdue model I don't know if

597
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,539
we don't I I wasn't exposed this at all

598
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:31,090
when I was working in only IT it wasn't

599
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:32,889
until I started working in in ot

600
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:34,658
environments that I really became

601
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:37,449
familiar with it and this is basically

602
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:40,000
just saying you you have your top level

603
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:42,220
and you're like corporate lands up here

604
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,590
in level five and then what this is

605
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,690
trying to say is is to have a DMZ in

606
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:49,120
between your Corp

607
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:51,190
IT networks and euro T networks we're

608
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,500
going to be level three and down and to

609
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:55,420
have enforcement zones or firewalls in

610
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,070
between each and only allowing the

611
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:01,050
minimal amount of traffic that's that's

612
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:01,050
required to go in and out of these zones

613
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,770
restrict viral roles only necessary

614
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:09,340
traffic ensure that logs are being

615
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:11,710
sentenced to securely if it's if if if

616
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:13,929
the device doesn't support an encrypted

617
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:19,090
transmission set up a tunnel do

618
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:21,430
something that yeah and that's just

619
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:25,169
going to put you in so much a better

620
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:27,530
position to be able to ingest those logs

621
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,530
yeah

622
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,210
you

623
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:41,270
we've I wouldn't say there's a simple

624
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:44,540
answer to that it's always based on the

625
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:46,220
hard hardware yeah there yeah I don't I

626
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,570
don't think there is one I've never been

627
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:50,690
able to give a simple answer that and

628
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:52,970
I've never had a one-to-one application

629
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:57,370
of this working in every Sitz always

630
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:59,450
gonna be slightly modified and edit

631
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:01,850
medication plans

632
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:03,920
you can't avoid having I could see a

633
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:06,350
quick quipment and you're in your own

634
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,660
environments vendors just aren't fast

635
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:11,899
enough with with upgrading boat both the

636
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:15,050
software and hardware to combat the the

637
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:16,160
threat landscape and I guarantee you if

638
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:18,560
you start doing this you're going to

639
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:22,160
have to work to collaborate with with

640
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:24,860
your ot engineers to mitigate a 20-year

641
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:27,140
old box running running Windows NT that

642
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,990
has some look and that has some control

643
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:32,679
function

644
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:36,789
right it is going to happen you can't

645
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:39,940
avoid it so talking about collaboration

646
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:43,299
this is more of a soft skill approach

647
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,770
but I was able to really break it down

648
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:47,529
into three three different approaches

649
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:49,960
here one is understanding and

650
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:52,090
appreciation well as much as we want to

651
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,309
integrate and talk about let's come

652
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:55,809
together let's be happy let's let's do

653
00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:57,340
all this stuff together we have to

654
00:30:55,809 --> 00:31:00,250
realize that the environment are

655
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:01,689
different for a reason so we need to

656
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:05,740
treat them differently and think about

657
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:07,240
identified vulnerabilities as in more or

658
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:11,049
less in the context of the environment

659
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:14,549
so if we go back to this example if I'm

660
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:17,830
if I'm running an IT sock and I see

661
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:20,320
incoming Boehner incoming SS traffic

662
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:22,029
into US internet-facing server in my DMZ

663
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,020
I'm not gonna be concerned about that

664
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:24,789
because it happens all the time

665
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,980
kids throw scanners or that stuff all

666
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:27,940
the time I have pretty protections

667
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,309
against that I'm not worried about that

668
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:32,080
but if I see a scan coming in through

669
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:33,700
the internet all the way down to an

670
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,760
engineering workstation in level 2

671
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,890
that's a really bad thing so it's the

672
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,299
same it's the same voter but it's the

673
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:42,820
same incident happening but in a

674
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:47,049
different context and it has much it has

675
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:51,629
very different consequences because it's

676
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:53,679
the difference in the environments to is

677
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:55,750
relationship building traditionally has

678
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,309
just been if we want to kind of bridge

679
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,279
that gap between these two we can just

680
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:02,678
have our IT security awareness go over

681
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:04,419
to ot and say this is why this is why

682
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:06,760
you should be so concerned with with

683
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:09,730
phishing and this is why you shouldn't

684
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,049
use USBs I just be like listen to me

685
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:13,120
this is the way it's gonna be because I

686
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:14,770
own cyber security responsibility for

687
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,989
the entire enterprise where that's a

688
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:19,539
real leadest approach and that's not

689
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:23,380
really trying to understand the cultural

690
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:25,480
differences between but instead try to

691
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,890
take of take an approach of what can we

692
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,409
learn from each other what can we what

693
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:31,179
can we do in terms of knowledge transfer

694
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:33,309
that we found works well in our

695
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:36,039
environments and learn so one example

696
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:37,539
I've found is OD teams are really good

697
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:39,399
at backups they're really good at

698
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:42,019
backups because the business will come

699
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:44,989
to a halt if their operations are

700
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:47,090
stopped and so they have really good

701
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:49,999
right readiness operations and

702
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:51,499
procedures built-in I think IT could

703
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:55,159
learn a lot from that and that could

704
00:32:51,499 --> 00:32:58,549
help IT respond or recover to a ransom

705
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:03,499
learn and infection and reduce their

706
00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:06,559
time to recovery another example is ot

707
00:33:03,499 --> 00:33:08,269
could learn from from my IT about Y USB

708
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,700
use gives them so much heartburn now to

709
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:12,950
talk about talk about Stuxnet talk about

710
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,649
delivery vectors talk up show them a

711
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,360
rubber ducky you know how dangerous like

712
00:33:15,649 --> 00:33:20,719
me and how and how easily that can be

713
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:23,869
done as soon as it's inserted another

714
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:27,440
thing I found a blog on this later too

715
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:29,240
about site tours bringing your IT people

716
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,759
in and talked into that too that one

717
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,679
system engineer and say what would ruin

718
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,259
your day what piece of hardware going

719
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,059
down would just ruin your day and it

720
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:40,879
shows you this piece of hardware maybe

721
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:43,070
it's a maybe it's an RT you maybe it's

722
00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:45,139
some kind of field field component say

723
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:47,240
if that goes down I'm gonna be working a

724
00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:49,340
24-hour shift to get operations back up

725
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,659
so like okay that's a really important

726
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,749
piece of equipment what can we do a

727
00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:55,490
cyber security to protect that but not

728
00:33:53,749 --> 00:33:56,960
halt business operations because if

729
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,179
business operations are halted you're

730
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,950
not making money I be security is

731
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:03,409
something that's only around because

732
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:05,269
companies have money right so don't

733
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:07,700
think of cyber security where we're

734
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:10,510
kings where royalty no it's it's a

735
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,510
support function

736
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:16,510
um then obviously there are there are

737
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:18,570
these like tensions or challenges to

738
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:21,460
overcome now we talked about the

739
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:24,460
cultural differences but between two

740
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:26,199
groups ot might be in a sense of like we

741
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,639
never upgrade we never change this is

742
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:29,739
the way it's always been done so that's

743
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,940
the way I'm gonna do it when in when in

744
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:33,549
reality that doesn't work anymore

745
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:36,659
because there's this this rapidly

746
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:41,290
growing threat threat landscape and

747
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:45,219
they're constantly evolving TTP's and

748
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:46,540
just growing growing threats ask the

749
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:48,009
question of who owns cyber security

750
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,139
responsibilities me in the OT

751
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:52,240
environment typically when you're

752
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:54,909
running an OC sock you have both the

753
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:56,469
responsibility and liability for any

754
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:58,509
cyber security incident across samurai's

755
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:00,339
someone at the top is not gonna care if

756
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,890
you're like oh well that infection was

757
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,750
in the OT environment um I just over

758
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:06,129
here hi T they're like no we're giving

759
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:08,560
all this funding where you're gonna

760
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:10,810
protect the entire enterprise and but

761
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,060
you have to balance that with some some

762
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:15,670
grumpy plant plant manager of a site

763
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:18,250
that's bad his his box has got knocked

764
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:21,040
over because someone ran a necess can so

765
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:24,040
every chance he has he says no to IT

766
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,950
coming in and and doing anything so it's

767
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:29,440
really trying to find find the find the

768
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:31,210
balance there something that we've

769
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,860
worked really well I think I talked

770
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:35,830
about it about it earlier about

771
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:38,650
organizing tours you know organize a

772
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:41,560
tour for your fort for your IT analysts

773
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:44,350
to come over to an operational site and

774
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,000
get briefed by the engineers and the and

775
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,339
the administrator there's like what's

776
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,990
your daily operations what what what's

777
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:53,440
your mission what struggles do you deal

778
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:55,810
with on a daily basis and and the

779
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,690
opposite you know I'm I'm working as a

780
00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:00,940
consultant right right now in a and in

781
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:04,830
an IT sock and they're constantly giving

782
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:07,000
tours to upper-level management

783
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,830
executives and any other employees of

784
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,220
the company who wants you to just get an

785
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:13,930
overview of the operations and I

786
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,549
understand how they're doing their

787
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:17,680
mission what they're doing why they're

788
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:19,870
doing it and just well when you start to

789
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,000
get when you just get briefed like that

790
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,950
and understand you become a little more

791
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,900
understanding of

792
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:28,970
why things are done in a certain way and

793
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:30,750
it just really starts to open up a

794
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:32,660
communication when you just start to

795
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:35,099
just talk about it talk about the

796
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:36,960
concerns and notices I know is that I

797
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:38,880
see folks we don't really like to talk

798
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,329
talk about a lot of these things but it

799
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,790
really starts to a dividend than that in

800
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:47,160
that operation so I just wanted to kind

801
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:48,750
of go over again like the benefits of

802
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,410
this you have your improved situation

803
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:55,050
where as you're gonna have much more

804
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:56,790
capabilities to respond to the adapting

805
00:36:55,050 --> 00:37:00,450
threats going to lower response times

806
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:04,470
and and if done done correctly can can

807
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:06,210
really start to drive down costs so I

808
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:10,500
just want to say thank you guys

809
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:12,349
there's my eye I always used a gif of

810
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:15,540
keyboard cat and all my college

811
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:17,220
powerpoints so thank you and I promise

812
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:20,359
these QR codes are not links to malware

813
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:23,129
it's my twitter twitter handle and email

814
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:24,839
this has been my first talk at a

815
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:27,950
conference so I wanna thank you guys for

816
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:27,950
suffering through it with me

817
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,848
I'd love love to take any questions I

818
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,940
know I ran a little short but any

819
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:37,940
questions
