course nothing works Wow next slide

6
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:34,230
there we go

7
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,210
I'm mr. glass area sober mints I'm a

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,559
developer a on cyber solutions they have

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,269
no idea what I'm talking about here

10
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,760
today they were very kind about sending

11
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:44,129
me here but no this represents them it's

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,070
all me I'm involved in all sorts of

13
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:53,399
community things many of you know me

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:55,980
from there not hi mr. glass been a

15
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,910
developer for about a decade now worth

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,309
about 10 organizations because startups

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,050
are terrible so hope you like to talk to

18
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,850
me about battle scene and the craziness

19
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:09,390
is involved and why you end up in 10

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,640
jobs in 10 years I can but the good

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,770
thing is I've had the opportunity to

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,970
work in a a lot of organizations and

23
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,619
every one of them works differently

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,660
being worked with a lot of different

25
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,060
technologies and wear a lot of hats as

26
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:24,780
you change roles so I really got a whole

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,700
breadth of what's going on focused

28
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,610
mostly on back-end web application

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,619
development I'm security so while I do

30
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,200
front end jobs occasionally most of what

31
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,720
I do is api's authentication things of

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,630
that nature laws cloud engineering and

33
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,830
applications like that I often get

34
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:46,880
suckered into CIC DS ops work so for OC

35
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:49,890
ICD our integration continuous delivery

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,050
terminology and DevOps for automated

37
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,580
processes for building and publishing

38
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:56,970
code I'll get into that a lot more later

39
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,920
I get often get into that for two

40
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,239
reasons first of all starts or small you

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,250
only have a few people on your team

42
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,319
somebody needs to do work getting

43
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,209
back-end I tend to be more into the

44
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,950
Linux server stuff than the front-end

45
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:10,949
developers so it often falls on me and

46
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,770
the other thing is DevOps just the

47
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:15,750
general move in the world to integrating

48
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,450
these specialties means that I've had to

49
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,430
learn more of any do more of it so I

50
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,480
often end up being the guy on the dev

51
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,700
team who spends a lot of time not

52
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,590
and I've always been obsessed with

53
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:32,089
security of going depth on college

54
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:33,530
things like that so I've always ended up

55
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,360
being the guy who did the security work

56
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,800
at the company and more recently I've

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,959
actually ended up to more of a security

58
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,459
resource level sometimes so I've also

59
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,510
done compliance work in small

60
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:47,080
organizations and things like that

61
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,040
that's me what we're going to talk about

62
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,099
today

63
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:55,450
so this talk comes from a bunch of rants

64
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:57,730
on Twitter basically since I've been in

65
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,379
this community for years I've seen all

66
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,420
sorts of people who get angry when a

67
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,920
developer won't listen to them or why

68
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,319
can't the developers just do this right

69
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,458
or why can't we do this and half the

70
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,899
time you're totally right that

71
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:09,819
developers being annoying he should be

72
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,920
fixing his damn code but half the time

73
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:14,560
it's like you don't understand there's

74
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,970
you know hours of processes involved and

75
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,319
you know it takes two days to publish

76
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,599
something and there's all sorts of stuff

77
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:21,578
going on and you know if you spent time

78
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,988
learning how developers work and how you

79
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:25,870
can work with them you might actually

80
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:28,000
get them to listen to you so this is

81
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,099
what inspired me to make this talk is

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,840
just all these rants people who don't

83
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:33,010
know how developers work haven't I

84
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,470
haven't worked with them at all and

85
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,700
don't spend the time learning and so

86
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,970
that's why I'm here to talk about we're

87
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,828
gonna tell you the process we go through

88
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,750
for developing a product the different

89
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:45,579
I'm gonna touch on agile little but not

90
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,220
a whole lot and how you can integrate

91
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:49,750
into agile as well as how you can use

92
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,450
what we have the tools that we use for

93
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,310
other work for security purposes and use

94
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,018
your leverage as a security person to

95
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,290
get security features built in by the

96
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:58,290
dead

97
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:04,460
developers our focus is shipping

98
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:08,270
features that's what makes the company

99
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:10,940
money when you work as a developer most

100
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,980
of us tend to want to go and dig deep

101
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,230
into a subject or spend hours figuring

102
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,300
out this one little bug right but you

103
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,709
spend 10 hours fixing it one-line bug

104
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,760
that you could have done by duplicating

105
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,079
that line of code somewhere else or

106
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,480
something you've just wasted a ton of

107
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,340
money and time right so we have to

108
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:30,530
balance good with actually getting

109
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:32,630
something out the door and this is kind

110
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,000
of pervasive in what I do now it's a lot

111
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,950
of what agile is about and so we have a

112
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,130
mentality about pushing code at the door

113
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,479
and so we don't necessarily go through

114
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,730
like the process you would do if you're

115
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,040
writing code at home or like we don't

116
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:48,700
dig in and learn a subject fully we just

117
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,700
can't

118
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,729
okay it was a bit of a rant if you saw

119
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,560
my bio on the website you might have

120
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:59,520
read that I hate DevOps AB seconds

121
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,800
anybody want to raise their hand and

122
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,859
tell me what DevOps is

123
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,860
you

124
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,530
okay that's a different one and I have

125
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,030
heard it's good that you bring up agile

126
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,559
though because DevOps reminds me of

127
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,580
agile and that it means something else

128
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,560
to everybody

129
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,700
some everybody has if you matter what

130
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,060
company you go to they will do agile

131
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:24,159
differently than the last one you are at

132
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,510
agile has a bunch of principles most the

133
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,670
places that do it end up sticky notes

134
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,420
pencils but DevOps has been a little bit

135
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,730
different

136
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,280
DevOps started right when I was getting

137
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,470
out of college and the idea was hey you

138
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,150
know the operations team is siloed the

139
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,970
development team is siloed the security

140
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,409
team is siloed right let's go ahead and

141
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,300
make these people work together let's

142
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,370
collaborate let's automate and use

143
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,810
coders do some of the ops work let's

144
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,910
work together and do this right right

145
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,000
and I originally develops had a huge

146
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,920
push for automation before reacting to

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,890
high load and for optimization and

148
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,690
things like that and also for optimum

149
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,490
ating processes that they couldn't go

150
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,010
wrong so build processes and things like

151
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,050
that or heavily automated now and that's

152
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:08,409
the devops world that's all from DevOps

153
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,960
and that's great but what happened was

154
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,610
they stopped talking about this very

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,950
clearly the businessí people know stood

156
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,990
horrible cliff you know horrible stock

157
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,969
our business guy they stop saying that

158
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:21,790
and it started being more like this oh

159
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:24,040
hey all about you all of our developers

160
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,180
are responsible for all the security and

161
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,350
all the ops work

162
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,370
I literally have interviewed of

163
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,380
companies where like everybody's

164
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,550
expected to be a sponsor all the office

165
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,250
everybody spent all the code I'm

166
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:35,080
vice-consul for this and this sounds

167
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,340
great in theory and I'm not trying to be

168
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,169
here and say I have no responsibility

169
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:42,029
when the server goes down I am also on

170
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:44,729
doing things to fix it but

171
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:47,369
we don't know opps the Gophers don't

172
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:48,869
understand how Linux works right I have

173
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:50,549
my favorite example is what's an inode

174
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:52,079
I've heard of it once when a server

175
00:06:50,549 --> 00:06:55,049
crashed and the other developer who had

176
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,879
heard of it before fixed it right and we

177
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:58,948
don't know how these things work an ops

178
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,989
guy is trained in this stuff and we have

179
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:02,939
no idea and there simply is no way we're

180
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:05,159
gonna get that knowledge so when you

181
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:06,479
make DevOps in your organization like

182
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:08,429
we're gonna be DevOps now you all are in

183
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,869
charge of DevOps they won't know what to

184
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:11,458
do and it's all you can send them to a

185
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:13,439
DevOps training camp they'll learn the

186
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:16,259
automation stuff but they're still not

187
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,329
gonna know how Linux works I literally

188
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,279
the only developers I have met who could

189
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:22,229
fix a like the Linux server is broken

190
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:23,489
and we need to bring it back alive we're

191
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:27,688
ones who are obsessed with open-source

192
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:30,328
freaks who did that as a hobby you need

193
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:32,459
a trained professional and the real

194
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:35,789
reason for that is this is your typical

195
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:39,259
learning curve it's the horrible graph

196
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:41,248
and I just made look like darby

197
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,959
untrained worker right and then you

198
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:44,339
slowly learn and maybe it gets harder or

199
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,229
easier as you go up and then you hit a

200
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,249
plateau when you're an expert you don't

201
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:49,378
learn much out there because you've

202
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:50,999
learned most of it that's fine when

203
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,110
you're developer you're always on this

204
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:54,449
learning curve every day is another

205
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:58,079
puzzle I have to solve usually lots of

206
00:07:54,449 --> 00:08:00,360
googling and so you end up doing

207
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,009
learning but you have to stop again you

208
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,539
have to should feature so typically I

209
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:06,360
get to about there which is literally

210
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:07,498
about two minutes after I've gotten a

211
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,409
level of knowledge or I'm comfortable

212
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:11,969
pushing my codes that's it so if I need

213
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:13,709
to figure out this Linux problem I learn

214
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:14,939
enough to say hey I have solved the

215
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:17,249
Linux problem and I don't learn how the

216
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:17,639
file system works because I don't need

217
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:18,959
to

218
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,009
that's the efficient thing for the

219
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,009
business and that's my job

220
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,120
what we need to do instead break down

221
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:31,230
walls work together you know have

222
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,669
teamwork they we cannot have people who

223
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,980
are good at all these specialties at

224
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:37,169
once it's simply not possible right how

225
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:39,210
hard is it to get skilled InfoSec people

226
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:41,159
right you're gonna get a skilled InfoSec

227
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:44,790
person who also knows hops and who also

228
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:47,310
knows development it's not happening

229
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,020
so most of the teams I have worked on

230
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,069
that have been good and what I look for

231
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,970
now in a company is these

232
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:56,700
cross-discipline product teams you have

233
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:58,410
anywhere from four to ten people they

234
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,520
have everything on their son

235
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,260
you'll have your developers in the room

236
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,660
you may have your ops people in the room

237
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,819
you may have QA engineers in the room

238
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,589
have design you may have you definitely

239
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,680
have a project manager these are

240
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:13,650
everybody involved in the process and

241
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,319
the thing is especially on the technical

242
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,970
side you want to have everybody's

243
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,110
knowledge to like this is our effective

244
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,360
our ops guy

245
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,650
everybody has the wool but you all share

246
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,170
these responsibilities everybody does

247
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:27,420
like 10% ops and 10% this and 10% back

248
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,920
and when they have a problem you don't

249
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,750
do what we call my company now is

250
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,849
throwing the ball over the wall right I

251
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,740
have this thing I'm trying to fix it I

252
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,050
need ops help I cannot figure out the

253
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,490
sauce problem I call the ops guy and we

254
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,500
don't just say he Rob's guy here's a

255
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,060
broken server fix it no you sit with the

256
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,530
ops guy you pair up you figure it out

257
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,020
together and then the next time that

258
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,850
sort of breaks you both can do it this

259
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,470
is the only way to get them to learn I

260
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,960
like this is the only way to share real

261
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,090
speciality work and it prevents mistakes

262
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,340
because you have the good ops guy paying

263
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,170
attention to what they're doing this is

264
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,910
the best day and you end up people who

265
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,890
have some of that skill but again we'll

266
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,829
never have that real ops person

267
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:07,740
knowledge all right I'm sorry for the

268
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,540
long tangent about DevOps but it kind of

269
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:14,580
is a background for what we're gonna go

270
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:19,230
into but let's talk about now agile and

271
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:21,090
sprint planning I'm planning backlog

272
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,170
grooming these are parts of agile if you

273
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,390
want to learn more about gel their

274
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,520
entire talks about agile specifically

275
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,110
for the security audience circuits Wan

276
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,090
did what a couple years ago besides look

277
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,470
it up you learn all the different parts

278
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,660
of the process and the principles and

279
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,000
whatever the prom with agile is every

280
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,530
company does it differently oh my

281
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,630
company doesn't have backlog grooming so

282
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,770
as much as and some company is all this

283
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,870
planning I'm gonna talk about what

284
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,550
happened back on grooming a bit my

285
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,340
company happen sprint planning cuz

286
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,140
that's what they do but you should talk

287
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:52,020
to project manager and get involved in

288
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,720
their agile process these planning

289
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,709
meetings are all team members who have

290
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,540
any

291
00:10:56,709 --> 00:11:01,149
any stakeholder in the project right so

292
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:03,069
QA sales people sometimes will show up

293
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:07,029
the project managers the product

294
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:08,769
managers and the core of agile is this

295
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:11,740
collaboration between these two teams

296
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:13,329
the the before agile came about you had

297
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,740
what's called waterfall process somebody

298
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:16,300
would sit in the room decide what

299
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,920
features would be like write an email

300
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,809
send it to the dev team and the dev team

301
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,240
would stare at the email go okay I'll

302
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:24,100
make our webpage that does that but you

303
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,749
run into issues right away you need to

304
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,730
collaborate need to talk to them so

305
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:30,550
agile it's about everybody gets in a

306
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,749
room hour to a week it's and talks about

307
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,889
what are the features we're building

308
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:34,689
this week and you go through all the

309
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:36,369
problems and the developer might go oh

310
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:38,050
you know it's hard for me to build a

311
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:39,220
three dimensional table like that but

312
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,839
you know if we get rid of this part of

313
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,040
the feature do you care about that okay

314
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,199
it'll take me a tenth amount of time

315
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,740
right and that you can only do that if

316
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:49,118
you have this cross meaning which is why

317
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,889
you should get involved with it to ask

318
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:53,110
for the security stuff right you're the

319
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:55,899
stakeholder for security now so get

320
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,999
involved has to be added to the meeting

321
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:00,160
invite check the agendas you do not need

322
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:02,439
to show up every time you do not need to

323
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,329
say anything half the time so my project

324
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:06,550
my product manager is in the meeting

325
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:09,699
every week and I've heard her say five

326
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:13,029
words in past two months but if we have

327
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:14,199
a question we turn to her um you do not

328
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:17,259
need to go to every meeting and

329
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:18,849
especially if you start going to these

330
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:20,529
meetings you start establishing yourself

331
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:24,370
you can get the point where they'll come

332
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:26,139
to you with problems so your goal is to

333
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,939
ask for security features in the

334
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:29,829
requirements so hey you're making a new

335
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:31,929
log in page can you make sure the login

336
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:33,399
page is mfa can you make sure that the

337
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:34,509
login page actually doesn't let you

338
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,029
interview enter in the wrong password

339
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:39,069
right these are requirements it's very

340
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:41,019
important to get them in early and you

341
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:42,399
should also raise security concerns if

342
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:44,110
they're starting a new project that's

343
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,279
gonna gather a lot of data if you're the

344
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,079
person in the room who's responsible

345
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,360
raise your hand going hey maybe we

346
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:51,189
shouldn't gather that data right you

347
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,509
know hey how are you going to secure

348
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:54,429
this data in the cloud how are you going

349
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:56,920
to encrypt it right you need to raise

350
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:59,049
those concerns early also want to answer

351
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,949
questions this is a my role a lot in the

352
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:01,689
room there's gonna be a new feature

353
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:03,819
somebody's asked to make a login page

354
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:06,309
they're like how do you make a secure

355
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:07,809
login page and then your job is to go

356
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:08,819
and tell them you know use this use that

357
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:10,650
you helped

358
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,240
and establish self has this resource

359
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:14,370
they could come to with these questions

360
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,110
because developers are spending all

361
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,880
their time trying to learn about the

362
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,050
problems that they can code it so if

363
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,130
you're the resource they'll come to you

364
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,089
and ask you for help I have been

365
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,090
googling it hopefully

366
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,770
it's important to get your requirements

367
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,569
early I can't stress that enough not

368
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:33,000
just because you don't want to be the

369
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,170
guy who comes in as we're about to put

370
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,520
code out in the door I mean like oh

371
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,860
actually you can't release that you need

372
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,170
to add encryption I that will make you

373
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,370
enemies fast it always happens and

374
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,990
everything there's always a change

375
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,279
requirements at the last minute but if

376
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,810
every time there's a release you're

377
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:47,730
coming in at the end and being like that

378
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,500
you're gonna make enemies which is why

379
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,480
agile was invented it was to prevent

380
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,830
this like long process of that the

381
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,120
helpers are working on the thing for

382
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,320
three months and then somebody goes and

383
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,930
sees what they ask for and it's not what

384
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,400
they asked for it so get involved in

385
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,099
time get your requirements in early

386
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,810
it also helps because the team needs to

387
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,920
estimate time and if the requirement is

388
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:08,160
in there they're not gonna put timing

389
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,560
for it right we and often the companies

390
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,209
will have a QA person whose entire job

391
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,439
is going down the list of requirements

392
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,540
and making sure they're actually

393
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,550
fulfilled well if you want during the

394
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,410
process of this feature going out the

395
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,790
door somebody sits and goes through and

396
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,680
make sure that security feature is in

397
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,719
there you put in the requirements and

398
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,250
often don't actually be out as unit

399
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,709
tests so it's not even a manual person

400
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,690
so every time the code gets tested with

401
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:33,000
the unit test program it'll run through

402
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,560
a test of whatever you want security

403
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,790
feature you once you get into the

404
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,650
requirements and you get all these

405
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,569
things that we use for general software

406
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,920
development right but you can do them

407
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,630
for security too and there's no reason

408
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,890
not to but you have to get them into the

409
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:48,810
requirements

410
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:51,939
and also ask for security features right

411
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:53,469
mfa is my favorite example of this MFE

412
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,330
is a feature it is a stronger

413
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,600
authentication mechanism companies sell

414
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,130
it

415
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,720
companies saw it as an add-on there you

416
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:01,000
have to pay more money for how is this

417
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,920
not a feature right so going at it

418
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,540
through the future backlog and that

419
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,620
gives you a different status this is no

420
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,849
longer a bug this is something we're

421
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,600
working on this is a product we're

422
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:11,330
shipping

423
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,530
whoa but it's this is it's not a

424
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,760
functional requirement rights isn't

425
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:16,040
requirement so requirements go on

426
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,450
features requirements are when you're

427
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,819
making long a page it has to do this

428
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,620
this is more we're gonna add a new

429
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,990
application thing to our application

430
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,120
it's gonna do something new so ask for

431
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,470
security features right people are all

432
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,770
sorts of companies are selling

433
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:32,930
encryption and an MFA as add-ons to

434
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,160
their existing web applications so you

435
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,900
know getting this feature to get you a

436
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,610
whole new status and developers now

437
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:41,050
their job is to work on your feature and

438
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,050
you're not even a bug slowing them down

439
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,450
my engineers time to refactor code so we

440
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,340
don't get to decide what we're working

441
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,690
on most of the time we'll sit there in

442
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,760
the meeting and we'll go man I really

443
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,800
want to fix you know the server's the

444
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,300
server's keep breaking on us but you

445
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,010
know where you have this quarterly

446
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,300
project due and I need to get that out

447
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,460
the door literally a conversation I had

448
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,290
with my boss yesterday right so I have

449
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,670
to stop working on the servers and I

450
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,439
have to go get the project out the door

451
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,500
if you come into security and you're

452
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,820
like no this is vital this needs more

453
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,800
time this needs to go it done you're

454
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,780
changing these priorities and now that

455
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,449
quarterly project may get backward while

456
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:19,430
I go and fix the security thing so going

457
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,170
in and being like hey that thing that's

458
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,579
causing you pain points that piece of

459
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,229
you know that piece of code that's

460
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,760
causing you issues that's also causing

461
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,110
security issues right the authentication

462
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,150
keeps breaking this thing gets killing

463
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,640
servers this is a problem that keeps

464
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,870
hitting us know them and say hey this

465
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,550
piece of code keeps you in security

466
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,500
issues so maybe go and refactor it

467
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:39,020
bolster their arguments for when they

468
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,310
want to refactor it because if helpers

469
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:44,930
always have a list of things they want

470
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:47,000
to refactor similarly we have a huge

471
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,709
list of stuff we want to spend time in

472
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,720
terms of infrastructure and tooling so

473
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:54,470
scripts for automation and deployment

474
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,520
scripts for checking stuff etc a lot of

475
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,960
companies again you need balance

476
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,640
developing these in turtle doing with

477
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,930
actually getting a product out the door

478
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,180
these are not even part of the product

479
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:04,550
right so the season even like oh I need

480
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,599
to fix this bug or I need to deal with

481
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,220
this issue in the product this is

482
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,230
completely the customers will never see

483
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,240
this all it does is make our jobs more

484
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,160
efficient right and does love that

485
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,109
because we're lazy so if I were job gets

486
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,750
more efficient it's easier for us but we

487
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:19,929
aren't given time for that long

488
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,920
abrogation automated testing

489
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:23,300
infrastructure is code so the idea that

490
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,620
you hit a button and it makes your

491
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,889
service for you based on the script

492
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:29,959
right monitoring all these are tools

493
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,070
that developers often are like yeah we

494
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,660
should really turn that on but we don't

495
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,280
have time and again if you come in as a

496
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,080
security person it's like we really need

497
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,879
Monterrey for our security apparatus too

498
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,639
now you have two people in the room who

499
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:47,370
want this feature and it gains priority

500
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:49,020
leveraging DevOps tools so most

501
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:51,209
companies every company I've worked at

502
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,310
most companies out there have an

503
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,290
automated process for doing their films

504
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:57,120
and getting code actually up on to

505
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,740
wherever it's going right this is

506
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,149
actually I work with working websites a

507
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,190
lot of terminology I'm using websites

508
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,810
but the same stuff happens with phone

509
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:06,270
apps the same stuff happens with Windows

510
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:08,429
computer applications everything these

511
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:11,160
days go through your CI and CV pipelines

512
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:14,160
they they check out the code they test

513
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,600
it they build it to see if it builds

514
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,910
right they then go through a functional

515
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,639
test etc they do all sorts of things and

516
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:23,430
the thing is these are all pretty much

517
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,200
bash scripting or something similar you

518
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,840
can hit a button to do it you can

519
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,610
trigger an event so a very common one is

520
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,470
hey not all these tests every time done

521
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,840
somebody does a pull request or somebody

522
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,250
merges two master right order you doing

523
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,379
my schedule I of stuff that runs nightly

524
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,060
right or every single time we hit the

525
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,460
build button to push code out just stick

526
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:44,429
this in there right and also they're all

527
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,140
built for alerting as well so something

528
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,370
goes wrong or you want alerts based on

529
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,850
what you're checking you can get that

530
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:54,840
right

531
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:57,360
so it's typical to do unit tests for

532
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,889
just general features colanders to check

533
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,689
style and things that the code stays

534
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,940
nice it's easier to maintain I don't

535
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,930
make sure it works simple check scripts

536
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,250
like that

537
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,020
and they'll build the application

538
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,540
actually run it of course even add

539
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,950
security checks writing functional tests

540
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,230
I don't understand why I don't see these

541
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,000
more it takes you about two minutes to

542
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,830
write a test there probably is already a

543
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,390
test actually that goes and logs in is

544
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,860
somebody right they'll take you two

545
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,270
minutes to doubt to take the code for

546
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,830
that test and modify it to put in the

547
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,990
wrong password and check that it says

548
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,370
password incorrect right how many

549
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,780
websites every year so you hear about a

550
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,790
website that just stopped checking

551
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,200
passwords and let everybody in they

552
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,480
added something like this it won't

553
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,920
happen right you can test the access

554
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,360
controls in the same way you can test

555
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,790
your input validation I have caught

556
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,870
scripts that like taking input have

557
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,540
impaired validation code that was

558
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:45,239
running and always returning true right

559
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,980
oh it's valid it's just always valid

560
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,630
so I've caught that by having these

561
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,210
tests that actually put something back

562
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,650
up and see that says nope invalid so you

563
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,780
can write those tests you can ask them

564
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,790
to be written you can also just run

565
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,059
premade tools so so literally add in a

566
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,590
bash line that runs

567
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:01,749
that checks all your packages and your

568
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:04,809
package manager every package manager

569
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:06,549
has it there's static vulnerability

570
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:07,989
Alice analysis stuff as well so again

571
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:10,599
you run the script and it checks for

572
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:12,099
known things that often go wrong or

573
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:14,109
known problems like sequel injection

574
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:16,168
right it's very easy to look at code and

575
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:18,820
say hey this might have sequel injection

576
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:20,259
so you can run the stack analysis and it

577
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,080
alert you and you can program it to

578
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:27,009
email you pop up and slack every day now

579
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,869
in my company I have we run all of our

580
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:30,460
unit tests and Konya security ones our

581
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:33,509
full functional test so it actually goes

582
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:36,129
through a full usage of our application

583
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:37,869
it checks all the libraries for security

584
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:38,978
vulnerabilities and I'm looking into

585
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:41,709
different statical in the billing

586
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:43,719
analysis tools but they're very they're

587
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,659
noisy at first so I haven't turned any

588
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:48,519
on yet but every morning at 9 a.m. I get

589
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:50,409
a little alert in slack weather this all

590
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:52,299
passed or something isn't right right

591
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:53,739
and I've caught in the past two weeks

592
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:57,070
I've caught three vulnerable NPM

593
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:59,879
dependencies because every day I get an

594
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,879
alert whether it is

595
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,490
if you wanted more of this and this is

596
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,410
my favorite thing to do right now there

597
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:08,180
was a huge conference a few days ago

598
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:10,010
called all-day DevOps it was all online

599
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,800
and all the videos are online now and

600
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:15,260
they had several talks on just this they

601
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,790
had a dev SEC ops track pacifically on

602
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:20,290
security and they had several talks on

603
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:20,290
just the tools and how to run

604
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:25,360
okay at a certain point you're going to

605
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,250
need to walk over to the engineering

606
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,379
team be like hey you guys have this

607
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,429
around this book right you don't need to

608
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,200
go in and go hey guys

609
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:33,429
we noticed that you're not actually

610
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,679
checking people's passwords when they

611
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:39,789
log in hopefully that goes great before

612
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:40,900
that thing goes oh my gosh that's

613
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:42,280
terrible I mean if it's not checking

614
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,080
password so probably gonna be oh my gosh

615
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,610
that's terrible but if you're like in

616
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,199
olders this bit of code and you can't

617
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:49,299
actually run this unless you're to an

618
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,650
admin but if you do that as an admin you

619
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:52,210
can then do this thing and that triggers

620
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,990
a vulnerability developers might go

621
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:57,130
uh-huh

622
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:58,419
and that's a problem we have many

623
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,490
stakeholders this goes back to the

624
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:01,840
buying US time argument so if you come

625
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,220
to us with that problem we might say

626
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,539
listen I'm not saying that's not a

627
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,809
problem but I have bigger fish to fry

628
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:09,580
right I have a long list of features in

629
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:11,408
my backlog like literally you want this

630
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,960
MFA but there are people waiting a year

631
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:16,120
for multi tenants right having two

632
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,990
counts for the same actual account to

633
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,459
sign into the same account bomb tendency

634
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,390
engineers they may not understand the

635
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,280
problem when you come to them you're

636
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:25,840
like hey you have this weird problem in

637
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,580
your Olaf scheme and the engineer will

638
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,899
be does not know Allah I'm the only

639
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,820
engineer I know that that actually

640
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,679
understands their life works there are

641
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,720
others out there but I'm the only Olaf

642
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:36,280
guy ever company I'd bet right so

643
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,780
they're gonna need to look into it and

644
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,399
they should be willing to learn and you

645
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,250
should be able to tell them at least

646
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,690
getting started right so if you come to

647
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,610
them and they like have no idea about

648
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:48,539
OAuth recognize that their job is

649
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:50,939
learning every day all right

650
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:53,049
hatching something is far easier than in

651
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,789
theory than in practice so you go to

652
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:55,960
them and you're like oh man can you fix

653
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:57,158
this they're like oh it's gonna take me

654
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,539
to a show like what it's just gonna take

655
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:00,880
to date why do these developers can't

656
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:02,140
get this fix out in 24 hours and it's

657
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,520
like yeah but you don't know that this

658
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,140
framework needs this thing and this and

659
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,639
I've had things that literally should

660
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,890
have been one-line change take three

661
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,840
weeks it's just nature of the beast and

662
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,270
these are these are all really the

663
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,590
things that I can rants about on Twitter

664
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:15,970
and like you need to understand that

665
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:19,959
you're working with people who have jobs

666
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:21,159
that isn't just security we often don't

667
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,289
get the chance to fix I have been

668
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,299
chastised at several companies or

669
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:26,940
working on a fix or dealing with an

670
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:30,760
incident rather than writing code that

671
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:32,290
several times in the state law hi it has

672
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,090
happened because they wanted me to be

673
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,379
working on code rather than fixing some

674
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:39,010
security bug that they weren't concerned

675
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:41,080
about most important and I see us a lot

676
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:43,240
sometimes pen testers walk in like jocks

677
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,490
like oh man your scoot is terrible I

678
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,440
found this problem that's how you make

679
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,810
enemies this isn't really a security or

680
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,910
developer thing you know be nice when

681
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:54,159
you come somebody and go hey your codes

682
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,180
broken you made something bad understand

683
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,790
that you're walking over somebody and

684
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,410
saying your work is terrible and so when

685
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:01,180
you do that approach it knowing that

686
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:02,410
you're saying that you have to like you

687
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,690
have to go and tell me did something bad

688
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,980
but approach it that way and know that

689
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,330
you're doing you're telling somebody

690
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:11,170
something that they're not going to be

691
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:12,970
happy about that's pretty much it

692
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:15,970
establish yourself as a knowledge

693
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:18,670
resource try to work your goals into the

694
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:20,710
requirements and some features here's a

695
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:22,870
capital buy time for engineers to do

696
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,490
what they want please please please look

697
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,989
into these tools if you have them your

698
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:28,570
company if you have developers please

699
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:31,149
tell them to look into doing it and be

700
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:33,210
tactful for godsakes

701
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:33,209
you

702
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,790
right so that that goes for to learn

703
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,530
anything right if you go to me like hey

704
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:49,540
and I looked into it and you need to

705
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:51,160
flip the switch in your library or you

706
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,139
can do this they'll usually appreciate

707
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,760
that you careful about talking down to

708
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,710
people right you know want to go a

709
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,240
developer be like oh you have a sickle

710
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,740
infection do you want me to do you know

711
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,850
what a sequel injection is every

712
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:04,390
developer has heard of a sequel

713
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:05,679
injection but they may be like oh yeah

714
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:08,050
I've heard of a sequel injection but how

715
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,990
do I prevent that right and you you need

716
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:12,879
to be prepared to be like oh I'll go

717
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,320
look into stuff for you or I'll sit with

718
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,790
you and I'll work on it or here's a

719
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,230
jumping-off point that I found you know

720
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:20,050
this other guy I don't know about sequel

721
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,760
injection but here's this talk I go be

722
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:24,580
prepared to help them that's huge

723
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,860
because they don't know security I've

724
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,600
had this thing recently when I interview

725
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,639
people I asked them three basic security

726
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,010
questions and I do when I asked them how

727
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,550
do you store a password how do you

728
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:40,960
prevent against I have somewhat XSS is

729
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:43,750
and what xsrf is and I have never gotten

730
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,550
the correct answer hopefully never now

731
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,780
these are web developers right these are

732
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:48,629
professionals in this field and they

733
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,910
don't know how to store a password or

734
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:53,260
about half will have a store password

735
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:55,960
almost none can I decked Lee

736
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,430
differentiate between xss and xsrf now

737
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,220
it's partly because those are terrible

738
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,570
terms and partly because you don't have

739
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,180
to deal with it because it's all baked

740
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:06,520
into the framework now so usually what

741
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:08,260
happens me no do you know what xsrf is

742
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,960
now in the cross-site request forgery I

743
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:12,580
have no idea you know it's something

744
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,690
with talking between sites again

745
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,659
terrible name cross-site request forgery

746
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,980
worst name I've ever seen some talk

747
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,540
about different sites whatever and I go

748
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,980
yeah it's not that you know that token

749
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,270
that's in all your forms automatically

750
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,010
for you from me like yeah yeah that's

751
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,930
the CSR thorny you're right yeah that's

752
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:27,820
prevent this thing and they've seen it

753
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:29,020
but they don't know the security portion

754
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,830
of they don't know why it's there

755
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:34,850
it's just part of their lives

756
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,850
any other questions

757
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,090
honestly I really don't think it would

758
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:44,399
be very valuable I think it's important

759
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:45,779
for developers to be exposed by winch

760
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:48,360
and the training sessions and send them

761
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:49,830
to things like this right give them a

762
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,299
day so that they were exposed to it so

763
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,080
they can see the concept can see how

764
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:53,490
hackers learn

765
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,139
I don't think sitting them in a

766
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,139
five-week course is gonna help much

767
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,660
oh there definitely is and I'm not

768
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,810
talking about security awareness

769
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:12,840
training security practices are

770
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:14,580
interesting they're not bad but the kind

771
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,379
of standards a lot of the stuff you see

772
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,639
in devops world and DevOps now DevOps

773
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,100
has transformed a little bit again and

774
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,830
now it's just modern ops right this is

775
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:25,290
what every option CD working together

776
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:27,389
things like that and so instead you know

777
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:29,040
secure coding practices are part of that

778
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,840
and they're a lot better than where

779
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,879
twenty years ago so most developers are

780
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,740
not durable about it and again you can

781
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,750
you can get mostly to secure development

782
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,040
practices in a day all right a two hour

783
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,540
training course just like security

784
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,280
awareness you get to 80% by having that

785
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:44,730
stupid two hours thing that we all hate

786
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,290
so I don't think you want to give them

787
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,630
like a five-week intent five-day

788
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,980
intensive course in the middle of

789
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,050
nowhere I don't think there's a huge

790
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,040
utility to it unless they want to do

791
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,570
security unless they're actually

792
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,580
building security features or doing

793
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,810
security engineering or you don't have

794
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,860
the security to engineer on your team if

795
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,750
you don't have a security engineer on

796
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:04,919
your team maybe send one guy over to

797
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:06,980
become a security engineer part-time can

798
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,980
I

799
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:12,820
you

800
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,590
you

801
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,230
yeah

802
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,830
you

803
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,630
so

804
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,890
startups in particular and most

805
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:30,350
companies these days are obsessive being

806
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:32,210
flat structures oh you know how all of

807
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:34,909
them don't even be have a manager but we

808
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,890
pretend he's not a manager right the the

809
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:38,600
main stakeholders in that meeting who

810
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:41,630
actually called the shots will be your

811
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,370
product manager product manager is in

812
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,960
charge of what features are there and

813
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:47,418
what the product is and a project

814
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,600
manager is making sure times are met

815
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:52,309
things get out the door etc so your

816
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,360
product manager will know about the

817
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:54,889
thing they're selling the project

818
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,299
manager will know nothing about it but

819
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,760
will know how to get the developers to

820
00:28:56,299 --> 00:29:01,668
actually put code out the door they are

821
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,020
the two usually calling the shots if

822
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:04,280
it's an actual technical question

823
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,870
usually there's some senior technical

824
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,940
person an engineering manager who can

825
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:10,250
call those shots but usually if it's a

826
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,289
one feature a on one feature B that's

827
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,789
the product manager saying this feature

828
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:15,379
is more important because I manage the

829
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:17,059
product or the project manager saying

830
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,340
you don't have time to spend on that

831
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:21,879
product that feature you need to work on

832
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,879
this other one

833
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:32,290
yeah

834
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:36,310
you

835
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:38,350
so um I touched on this a little but I

836
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:40,000
might not gone into it really a lot of

837
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,159
the cross-functional teams some of the

838
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,900
people will be on multiple P my project

839
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,580
manager works for three teams if you

840
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,530
have QA and design they're not spending

841
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,389
as much time on an individual thing as a

842
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:52,149
developers so they'll work with several

843
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:53,680
teams that's one thing right one person

844
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:55,210
can cover multiple teams if the load on

845
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,860
them from that team isn't bad but they

846
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,590
can't be in meetings all day every day

847
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,699
to attend these meetings different

848
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,990
companies the different things the

849
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,970
bigger companies have moved toward

850
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:06,310
making secure libraries and other tools

851
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,720
like that so Google all my Google

852
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,280
engineer friends have no idea about

853
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,500
secure I say something to them they're

854
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,389
like oh yeah what's the password hashing

855
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,800
algorithm these days because there's a

856
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,030
list of algorithms are approved in they

857
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,500
use that right you're encrypting

858
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,100
something to use Google pink which is

859
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,260
open-source

860
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,719
highly recommended option library easy

861
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,120
to use it's made by the security team

862
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,770
the security engineering team I believe

863
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:29,290
be almost idiot-proof

864
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:31,030
so if you use Google tink there aren't

865
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:32,980
all the weird settings you can get wrong

866
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,690
with in cryptography they're not thinner

867
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,890
you're they're probably under the hood

868
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:37,150
somewhere you can probably change there

869
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:38,560
you want to but the way you're supposed

870
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,910
to use Google pink you don't get to

871
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,889
change the settings that everybody gets

872
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:43,540
wrong so they're working on libraries

873
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,850
that developers can use without security

874
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:48,040
knowledge the biggest mistake I see for

875
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:49,510
security is people are they're not using

876
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,149
a framework so I do web dev and there

877
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:53,500
are web dev frameworks in every language

878
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:55,840
people either don't use the framework or

879
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:58,510
don't use the tools of the framework

880
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,909
they're in so your framework will have

881
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:03,760
almost always a form processing library

882
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:05,110
which will do validation for you but if

883
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,879
you don't use the form processing

884
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:09,719
library to process the form you don't

885
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,720
get the validation

886
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,530
you

887
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,800
yeah

888
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,800
you

889
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,550
another thing I have done developers

890
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,290
tend to be extremely curious and loved

891
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,210
learning about this stuff so if you see

892
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,920
an interesting talk that's slightly dev

893
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:47,920
centric or an interesting article or

894
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,660
some goal post in their chat book ended

895
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,730
phenomen right I've sent the POC or gtfo

896
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:54,280
to numerous developer teams and they'll

897
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,600
go in a meeting which gets them in that

898
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,520
mindset right gets it in their head

899
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,809
they're thinking about security it's not

900
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,580
gonna be anything practical what they're

901
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:01,629
coding right now but hey look at all

902
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,889
these weird traits you can do maybe

903
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:07,660
think about what that means for your

904
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:11,190
code any other questions I think we're

905
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:11,190
over time Thanks

906
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:25,090
if anybody would like a card contact me

907
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,090
later come see me

908
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,810
you

909
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:37,729
I mean that's true of libraries and NPM

910
00:32:35,149 --> 00:32:40,668
um but that's the known vulnerability

911
00:32:37,729 --> 00:32:42,619
analysis right so you put that tool in

912
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:43,700
your CI and you just get alerts there

913
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:45,559
are some companies I've hooked it up and

914
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:58,809
automatically update it which is recipe

915
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:58,809
for disaster presentation
