1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,000
Oh

2
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:15,349
all right cool so this is retro game

3
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:17,419
reverse engineering and that shows some

4
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:20,119
sort of software stuff in Pokemon and

5
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:23,000
some part where stuff kind of with

6
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:25,960
fences before and also Coulthard stuff

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,480
my name is a flower and this is a stump

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:34,000
follow us on Twitter while I'm in the

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:36,060
way that's okay and let's go

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,060
you

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,100
all right cool so this is my credibility

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,420
I spoke at Blum Khan for the last three

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,850
years and they've had it back a few

14
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,020
times I was cool I first talked with it

15
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,180
is lessons learned from putting away

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,550
University of how I found her shell

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,920
injection in Penn State's website and

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,830
then hold them about it in a responsible

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,110
way I said I've taught what it is near

20
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,730
2018 what it was titled all the third

21
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:03,260
thing you need to go hacker in 2017

22
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:04,670
because out of deke stuff and stuff I

23
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,340
don't think that wonder is recorded the

24
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,800
first one was and the third talk is this

25
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,479
one but not as good we get to do it

26
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,410
again here which is awesome and it'll be

27
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:18,190
recorded that's wonderful and we have

28
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,190
cooler stuff this time

29
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,060
so I'm gonna talk about the El tari also

30
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,720
Hollow I'm non-binary my pronouns are

31
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,210
they then

32
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,220
thank you so first I'm just want to pass

33
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,470
this around

34
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,850
look at that joystick get an opinion

35
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,730
about if you think it's good or not

36
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,199
but anyway this story this whole thing

37
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,870
starts with Craigslist and I love to

38
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,910
practice because you can get cheap stuff

39
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,410
like really low prices because a lot of

40
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,330
people don't know what they have or what

41
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,158
it's worth and there's a lot of

42
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:49,170
different stuff like

43
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,799
breakfast is great check it out buy

44
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:56,790
stuff on it and sort of meet during

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,220
daylight in like populated parking lots

46
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,040
like at a gas station or something and

47
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:04,600
you probably won't get stabbed like

48
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,780
works for me

49
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,780
life

50
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,760
all right so I've got my Atari from

51
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,209
something on Craigslist and really I

52
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,159
thought the joystick sucks like it feels

53
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:21,390
terrible like moving it up and down I

54
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,250
don't know if anyone in the audience

55
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,470
like agree something after they sort of

56
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,900
try to do the round a bit it sucks and

57
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,760
there's sort of a hacker mantra is like

58
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,650
I want something better I will make

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,010
something better so can I have everyone

60
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,610
say that with me I want something better

61
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,890
I will make something better awesome at

62
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:47,579
Blum Connolly one person said that so

63
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:49,260
it's great all right so you also you're

64
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:51,540
legally required to have a son suit

65
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,209
quote in your slides if you're giving a

66
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,590
presentation at cybersecurity conference

67
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:57,480
but it's not enforced so it doesn't

68
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,700
matter but I want to know sort of what's

69
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,190
going on with the Atari joysticks I want

70
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,560
to make something better so over here is

71
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,879
a screenshot from Wikipedia that I sort

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,099
of cropped because the whole image it

73
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,010
was too big and it shows the pin out of

74
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:14,910
the Atari we have our pins and they do

75
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,709
stuff and basically what I did is I just

76
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,510
kind of connected some wires to the pins

77
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:20,639
and touch them to each other sort of

78
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,679
figure out what was going on which in

79
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,639
hindsight was probably a bad idea but

80
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,349
I'm not an electrical engineer so I

81
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,849
wasn't too afraid of the electricity and

82
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:32,429
I thought again it's low voltage I won't

83
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:34,290
die and I didn't die I figured out that

84
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,169
basically if I connect any of the pins

85
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:40,290
like one two three four or five four

86
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:43,230
buttons at least here the digital

87
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,660
buttons on the Atari if I connect that

88
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,790
to ground the Atari thinks that I'm

89
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,540
pressing the button because on the next

90
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:55,108
slide we have a very good diagram that I

91
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,870
drew in GIMP like six months ago

92
00:03:55,109 --> 00:04:02,470
and essentially this is the joystick and

93
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:04,930
sort of a bad circuit diagram

94
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,660
I don't know which way it is ground or

95
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,070
purposes it really doesn't matter

96
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,049
basically imagine that this is the

97
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,910
firebot that I mean you press it it just

98
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,130
sort of completes the circuit and the

99
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,560
Atari thanks for pressing fire and the

100
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,120
joystick it's not actually like an

101
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,790
analog joystick like you'd find on a

102
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,310
modern like controller for a new console

103
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:41,050
it's basically just four buttons but

104
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:44,080
it's mechanically set up but that sort

105
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,330
of design kind of and get pretty crafty

106
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,250
pretty quickly it wears out it just

107
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,320
doesn't have a really good tactile feel

108
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,340
to it that's what I wanted to sort of

109
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,340
fix and make better

110
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,510
I have a Raspberry Pi I thought yes this

111
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,490
is what I'm going to use it has its GPIO

112
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:03,130
pins which is just a general purpose

113
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,260
input output pins so it's like five

114
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,900
volts and I can send digital signals or

115
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,699
receive digital signals or analog as

116
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,770
well but I'm a little caring about the

117
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:13,810
digital pins on the guitar right now so

118
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,490
that's what it was using it's also just

119
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,970
really easy to develop on you just sort

120
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:21,430
of like download the like image you put

121
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,260
it on to the SD card you like create one

122
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,510
file so that you can actually SSH into

123
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,389
it and it has this Python so I don't

124
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:30,010
have to install it or do anything Python

125
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:31,810
it's easy to just sort of quickly

126
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:35,099
rapidly develop in prototype stuff with

127
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,100
it and that's why you

128
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,680
sort of playing around and you go with

129
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,810
this one Python GPA Oh librarian that

130
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,150
I'd previously used on a Raspberry Pi to

131
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,650
control of a real controlled car when

132
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,270
you're trying to make an iPhone app that

133
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,400
would control a remote controlled car

134
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,140
I'll tell you the rover and it won

135
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,330
second place in a hackathon and a few

136
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,520
years ago so we just sort of connected

137
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,919
some Raspberry Pi pinch the Atari pins I

138
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:03,510
turn them on and off I think I was

139
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:06,240
playing this game Star Wars Episode five

140
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:08,460
it shows this game because I thought the

141
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,650
game sucked but it uses the up-down

142
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,169
left-right and fire so I was ok with

143
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:15,120
like sort of seeing this game a lot and

144
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,370
hearing the game a lot when I was in

145
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,350
sort of a bad situation it's like it

146
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,390
works I hope it works I thought you know

147
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,070
what I already don't like this game I'm

148
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,570
okay with hating this game because I'm I

149
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,820
used a really good game like Missile

150
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,990
Command but also fit my requirements I

151
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,880
thought you know what maybe I'll hate

152
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,010
Missile Command and I already had really

153
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,900
loved it and didn't want to hate it sort

154
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,330
of turn the Pinzon off Wow and I was

155
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,219
like wow because at one point the space

156
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:41,000
shift moved that's sort of figured out

157
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,000
what I did and

158
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:48,270
like all right yes it's good

159
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,670
so what I had to do next was sort of get

160
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:53,669
USB inputs and then convert that to

161
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:55,950
Atari inputs but I am a good programmer

162
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,450
or maybe a bad programmer I'm a

163
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,940
programmer and I thought that's scary I

164
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:02,460
want to do something easy instead and so

165
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,960
I just sort of throw an abstract code

166
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,270
that I hope would be useful in the

167
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,859
future and save myself time I made a

168
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,359
sort of joystick class or it just sort

169
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,740
of said all right these are the pins

170
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,280
these are the numbers that go to the

171
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,700
buttons

172
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,729
had like a press up function I press the

173
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:20,340
down function who's really good and I

174
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:23,900
was like ah yes this will be useful to

175
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,900
me I hope and it was

176
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,560
all right so it's getting USB inputs

177
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:32,199
eventually I found a Python library

178
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,520
called a dev but the problem with it is

179
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,290
that it doesn't just like listen to

180
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,810
everything sort of have to tell it hey

181
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:40,900
call us function and listen to these

182
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:43,000
devices and thankfully I was able to

183
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,969
just sort of to get a list of devices I

184
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,910
was interested a name I just doing LS

185
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:50,800
dev input which is like basically every

186
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:54,340
single thing that my computer is making

187
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,470
input from and I just ran that through

188
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,869
grep and tried to find anything with

189
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:02,800
event now Pat putted that to a file

190
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:04,330
called eby's because that was like three

191
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,530
letters and easy to type and I was like

192
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,190
yeah this is fine at the time

193
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:11,049
I have Python open that up and then it

194
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,430
can sort of see what's going on it said

195
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,919
all right leads to the ones I care about

196
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:17,320
I took some nice sample example code of

197
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,330
how people use the library and I mangled

198
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,010
that and it was basically just printing

199
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,130
out every button I pressed I was like

200
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:25,840
yes this is perfect cuz I'm like

201
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,310
thinking about oh no I need to get used

202
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,320
to being put that's really scary but

203
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,270
just having a sort of feed of strings

204
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,780
that I can just parse that's that's a

205
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,780
lot easier

206
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:41,480
goal is to associate an input string

207
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:44,300
with a function call and in place on

208
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,220
everything is an object so basically

209
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,829
what I did is I had a dictionary of

210
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,450
where the keys were the input strings

211
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,400
that I wanted so I'd say all right so

212
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,130
I'm gonna bind a key I'm gonna bind a

213
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,260
key I'm gonna buy the key to like a

214
00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:01,490
different input so the way the code

215
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:03,650
works is actually good my controller I

216
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,230
just pressed sort of the buttons I want

217
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,490
them to be in a certain order and then

218
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,020
it'll say alright cool this input

219
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,910
strange is going to be the key in the

220
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,260
dictionary and a contents of the

221
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:15,439
dictionary won't give me the function

222
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,360
and I just sort of like how functions

223
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,280
and it's really cool and my quotes on

224
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,680
github and I think it's mentioned in the

225
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,350
later slide

226
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,628
but not this one basically first it goes

227
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:29,059
through binding mode every single new

228
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:32,059
input from the controllers is sort of

229
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:34,309
bound to a joystick function I ignore

230
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:35,959
analog input because that turns out to

231
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:38,509
be a huge pain in the butt to deal with

232
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:40,670
and I don't wanna like I tried reading

233
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:42,199
code to sort of simplify it but it just

234
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:45,229
didn't work and I was like all right I'm

235
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:47,660
just going to ignore a knob in place but

236
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,269
basically after 10 unique inputs because

237
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,550
we have player 1 and player 2 in the

238
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:53,929
Atari is going to have everything bound

239
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,550
and it's going to go into play mode

240
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:59,089
where we actually get to play the games

241
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:01,550
and making a good note to myself Oh

242
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:03,350
Peters left right down fire up that's

243
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,899
the order I have to press buns and to

244
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,939
make it work how I want I don't know why

245
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:11,949
it just is that way and I don't want to

246
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:11,949
change it because it works

247
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,269
think it's time for a live demo of this

248
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,269
Oh

249
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:28,339
all right good all right Harley it's

250
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,649
hard

251
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:32,649
capturing it oh hey that was a sound

252
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:50,160
plugged in oh my god a charge plugged in

253
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,160
before you view them

254
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:59,399
you

255
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:59,399
table put in like minutes ago

256
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,510
you

257
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:19,420
[Music]

258
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:23,260
all right that's father so now all right

259
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:25,060
so I need to have my phone turn on a

260
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:28,120
Wi-Fi hotspot for the Raspberry Pi to

261
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:30,819
connect to and I'm going to SSH into it

262
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,480
and I have to do stuff and hopefully it

263
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,480
does what I want

264
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:51,770
my dance play Frogger hopefully and then

265
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:55,900
this thing is plugged in as well finds

266
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:55,900
player to first and I want to be

267
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,579
yeah

268
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,000
you

269
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,670
all right

270
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,770
you

271
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:25,929
all right cool it shouldn't be running

272
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:35,139
so I'm going to press down left right

273
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:38,220
fire up on this controller fire it up

274
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:38,220
and hopefully

275
00:12:39,510 --> 00:13:19,720
all right yeah cool oh all right so it

276
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:21,399
was working before all right all right

277
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:48,220
actually I think I can set it to the

278
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:51,390
two-player mode all right all right I'm

279
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,390
just gonna turn it off and back on

280
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:13,969
because like for my part

281
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:16,069
the like mighty time I was going to come

282
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,279
out of that talk about welcome you know

283
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,279
this

284
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,390
before were we gonna have an echo

285
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,480
oh yeah

286
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,630
you

287
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,089
you

288
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:50,000
all right let's try finding this one

289
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:50,000
first down right fire

290
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:56,420
left-right fire up turn on Frogger

291
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,950
it reset

292
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:14,529
this one again already yeah so I'm

293
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:14,529
playing Frogger with Pettis

294
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,269
all right so now it shouldn't be maybe

295
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:31,990
in two player mode I died out of this I

296
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:31,990
can play on this

297
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:50,380
all right so here we go just let the Dan

298
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:52,139
expand I'm using sort of hasn't folded

299
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,459
up for a long time and it kind of sucks

300
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:55,660
wants to come up and try to stamping

301
00:15:54,459 --> 00:16:00,930
their way across the river

302
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,930
feel free anyone all right

303
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:07,610
one person once the truck come on

304
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:10,180
alright so you see it up there you can

305
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,180
see back here

306
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:23,949
maybe it can move off the plate alright

307
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,950
alright now it should work

308
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:34,699
alright that's also sort of move side to

309
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:36,260
side is those cars alright so when you

310
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,360
get to go and then we're gonna finish

311
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,140
this part of the talk and he's going to

312
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,140
talk about Pokemon

313
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:46,620
yes Froggers hard

314
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:56,319
you

315
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:02,719
it works yay all right questions we'll

316
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:05,200
do that at the end remember your

317
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,200
questions

318
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,850
contact me yes that's my twitter handle

319
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:15,199
that's an email that's a Google Voice

320
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:18,199
phone number and if you go back and find

321
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:21,220
that tweet it'll probably have pretty

322
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,220
close to these slides

323
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:34,930
nice yeah

324
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:38,710
oh I thought it was like dig deep into

325
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:41,140
how things works on over to the hole and

326
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:43,920
such and put unintended behavior things

327
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,920
can be made to

328
00:17:52,700 --> 00:18:05,990
so I quite a while ago I did a device

329
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:10,330
driver and less long ago I made I put

330
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,330
together this device here which

331
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:21,790
here's an Arduino and it's connected to

332
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:24,760
a cut-off and 54 controller cable and it

333
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:28,090
this is set up to bang the controller

334
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:32,070
protocol that I can make interesting

335
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:35,620
things happen with the out of the

336
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:37,960
expansion slot of it namely reading and

337
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,399
writing state files from our ears

338
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,760
plugged into a transfer pack which we

339
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,760
will be

340
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:56,620
so I'm mainly gonna be talking about

341
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:58,889
some things in the first gen and put my

342
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,889
games

343
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:06,500
there are a lot of edge cases that

344
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:09,790
aren't properly handled in them

345
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,790
and we can

346
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:17,970
we can explain some of them

347
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:21,980
and I remain involvement in this it like

348
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:26,390
with making

349
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:30,890
interesting things happen here is to

350
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:34,830
think is to speedrun the games and help

351
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:37,370
improve the routes of them so that's the

352
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,370
main angle

353
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:48,590
just something to anyways today but if

354
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:52,460
faster as they

355
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:57,309
something to exploit the game for

356
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,309
so there was a little large

357
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:04,020
the way that the popularity of the games

358
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:09,000
had and people were stumbling upon

359
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:11,059
things and hearing stories about them

360
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,230
and

361
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:19,660
something and this often resulted in

362
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,660
and true legends but also

363
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:33,100
but also in things that have something

364
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,690
that look like don't look that useful

365
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,439
but have something a little bit deeper

366
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,440
going on

367
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,999
like on the east on the passage out of

368
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:50,759
pewter city the east if you have an

369
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:53,639
unbeaten Brock yet there's an NPC that

370
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:56,909
will forcibly talk to you and walk you

371
00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:59,549
over there and if you skip them which

372
00:20:56,909 --> 00:21:01,529
you can do by saving and reloading at a

373
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:04,820
particular spot and you talk to them

374
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:07,470
from the right the game tries to load

375
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:10,350
the movement data out that year to

376
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:12,090
follow but according to the coordinate

377
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,549
that you talked to him from but there

378
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:16,740
isn't one set for that so the game

379
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:20,759
appears to be completely soft locked and

380
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:24,320
not doing anything but there's still

381
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:28,409
that loop going on that marketed that

382
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,119
isn't looking for any form of Terminator

383
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:35,159
in the table because that's not supposed

384
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:39,230
to happen so it continues marching

385
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:39,230
through the entire address space

386
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:46,120
and for something for a matching entry

387
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:52,110
in that table

388
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:52,110
so that also included Ram we have

389
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,879
like where we have our own data

390
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,720
Oh

391
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,720
I can bypass this

392
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,390
reload I mentioned

393
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,480
whew

394
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:24,600
let's

395
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:26,880
if

396
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,939
is there

397
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,940
you

398
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,510
right

399
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,490
there Oh

400
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,590
[Music]

401
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:40,720
all of you out there nice thing about

402
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:43,139
16-bit addresses you can just go right

403
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,140
through them

404
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,720
you

405
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,590
here's the

406
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:05,210
the table of your coordinates ends

407
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:10,640
the address of the movement data for

408
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:14,630
them o X 11 X 23 use one set x1 to x2 5

409
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,160
use another but there was only a there

410
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:19,809
were only a few titles that where that

411
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:22,340
supposed to happen so there's no

412
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:26,110
counting no check and no bounds checking

413
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,110
no termination of any kind

414
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:35,070
marks right past the end of that table

415
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:37,450
or in the 73 s now where there's no

416
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,439
where it doesn't look like a table like

417
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:42,220
that anymore

418
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,530
and if we hadn't set things up set our

419
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,210
party up in a particular way then if I

420
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:48,040
continued the emulation you would just

421
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:51,479
hear the music and absolutely nothing

422
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:55,579
would happen if your to be happening and

423
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:55,579
you would have to reset the system

424
00:23:58,149 --> 00:24:06,238
Oh our coordinates are in registry BC x1

425
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:09,239
0 to 4 and in our party data which I had

426
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:09,239
here

427
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:23,370
there's our coordinates and this so soon

428
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,370
we'll find them

429
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:33,550
Alice oops whose additional jumps

430
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,939
for when it did not match so if we

431
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:39,629
continue there really see that it got to

432
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,630
that and it matched

433
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:48,699
then we start copying the data to a

434
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,450
place where there is not enough room for

435
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,450
what it points to

436
00:24:52,450 --> 00:25:05,590
and here's like the buffers around here

437
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:10,510
and c-d-i then continue you'll see all a

438
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:18,360
whole bunch of random data lands in the

439
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:21,658
memory that's showing and we

440
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:24,059
normally this is in cutscenes you can't

441
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:25,620
control the character but one of the

442
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:29,700
variables that gets corrupted and this

443
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:32,100
gives you control and also lets end a

444
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:36,710
different part of what's going on lets

445
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:36,709
you walk without regard to the collision

446
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:45,290
turning what was thought to be a soft

447
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:45,290
lock into something more

448
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:56,310
but that's an example of like things

449
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:59,270
that the code assumes can't happen that

450
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:59,270
you can

451
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:06,460
got something useful to happen if you do

452
00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:06,459
make it happen

453
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,190
you

454
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:28,470
and all those links worth of code at

455
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:30,530
play in the from the hominid disassembly

456
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:34,180
that

457
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:34,180
as for this

458
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:40,350
that's one example of seven how

459
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:50,449
go want to we'll go on to the best part

460
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:58,139
so here's the

461
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:04,159
you

462
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:04,159
here's the what I the other for for the

463
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:11,039
here's the code that's running one there

464
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:15,690
a because of the way the little line

465
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:18,419
works they actually did some cycle

466
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:20,220
counted and line up large plot with

467
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:25,220
inline assembly here to get the right

468
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,220
timings but that's the rate things

469
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,970
you

470
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:38,740
and I've got a Python

471
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:42,090
drive it to extend their to write things

472
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:47,070
over the over USB interface to make it

473
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:47,070
write something to the cartridge

474
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,230
you

475
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,700
you

476
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:00,080
we'll take a five

477
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:12,189
yeah so

478
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:18,350
education will occur here and

479
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:22,550
[Music]

480
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:25,370
it does the right operations and the n64

481
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:27,409
controller protocol to enable this

482
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:31,199
transfer pack that's plugged into it and

483
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:34,960
write out a new save file to it

484
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,779
so I just put on this cartridge the save

485
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,039
file from the first playthrough of

486
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:41,039
twitch plays Pokemon

487
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,740
so

488
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:52,899
I have a way player in this game cube

489
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:56,679
here so that you can see that the sag

490
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:59,460
that like this really is what's one

491
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,460
there but

492
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:19,739
so the official software for using that

493
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:22,389
thing is like has some shortcomings so

494
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:26,320
like some better software has been made

495
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:31,570
where it called Gameboy interface but

496
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:36,279
wow that's not you know not something

497
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:41,168
that you can directly load through

498
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:44,740
official channels so in for systems like

499
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:51,039
the Gamecube which is which are like

500
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:53,200
past the older cartridge era where you

501
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:58,310
would run custom code by beating the

502
00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:00,650
cartridge I think just

503
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:05,740
I heard about a flashcard or something

504
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:10,690
and not but not knew enough to like have

505
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:12,620
have ways to interface with things that

506
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:15,800
general-purpose computers can also

507
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:20,500
interface with and if you don't want to

508
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:20,500
modify the console you're left with

509
00:30:21,389 --> 00:30:23,718
with

510
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:35,429
through by exploiting an official game

511
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:39,839
for it so where did that the community

512
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:43,289
has developed a whole bunch of different

513
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:48,799
packaged save files to put onto your

514
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:48,799
memory cards that you can

515
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:53,070
that use different exploits in different

516
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:59,490
games that you're likely to have at

517
00:30:53,070 --> 00:31:03,300
least one of and Lodha and boot some

518
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:06,260
payload is in packaged in a different

519
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,260
file so

520
00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:10,559
okay

521
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,669
you

522
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,629
you

523
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:35,070
we're going to use the game Super Smash

524
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,260
was mainly because a name entry for that

525
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:39,179
the way it loads from the memory card is

526
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,740
it loads the name and then at the end is

527
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,510
the little termination things say this

528
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,980
is the end of the name a little bit next

529
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:46,230
corner or maybe you're done or something

530
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:48,540
that's useful because names are supposed

531
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,130
to be up to four characters but if you

532
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,720
have a name that's like a thousand

533
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,700
characters long it'll just keep loading

534
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,670
new character for the name and putting

535
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:58,410
them into memory even if like that

536
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:00,510
memory should be something else we'll

537
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:02,880
just write over stuff and we can use

538
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:06,030
that to sort of get our Perico execution

539
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,890
and this lets us do it into the Gameboy

540
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:09,950
player

541
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,950
you

542
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:14,870
yeah so we booted that from the memory

543
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:20,290
card that's plugged in here and we got

544
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:24,439
it once it there by using by using some

545
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:26,590
Wii homebrew the Wii is a useful bridge

546
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,020
to this because it supports both

547
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:31,939
GameCube memory cards and SD cards and

548
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:36,980
so you can put what you want onto the SD

549
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:38,750
card through whatever transfer stuff

550
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,480
indiscriminate you between your SD cards

551
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:45,110
and gave you memory cards and we play

552
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:49,400
pokemon yeah and if we load the safe out

553
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:57,080
here you can see that we have the final

554
00:32:49,400 --> 00:33:00,500
state from switch place back on so I've

555
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,000
got another any different file to also

556
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:09,320
load one to this and that's a

557
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:12,620
consequence of so like for a lot of

558
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,899
gameboy games the save file is just

559
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:17,260
directly mapped into the address space

560
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,260
and

561
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,570
is generally directly copied to and from

562
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:25,960
some part of it and this includes

563
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,960
pointers

564
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:31,470
so

565
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,470
you

566
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,379
you

567
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,860
you

568
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,600
you

569
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:46,360
so I have

570
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:51,360
copy here of the payload that was used

571
00:33:51,370 --> 00:34:00,360
at the end of the ad agency exhibition

572
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:00,360
had awesome games done quick 2016

573
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,059
that right yeah yes it is

574
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:16,418
yep that goes through so that has been

575
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:20,380
modified to have some of those liked

576
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:26,400
wieners moved into into the save file

577
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:31,090
and ocean who made it has a really nice

578
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:33,600
right above it that is linked here

579
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,600
but

580
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:42,168
you

581
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:46,370
you

582
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:48,440
yeah so there's like this is sort of

583
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:50,540
also playing into like the like old

584
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,520
myths of like different Pokemon glitches

585
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:55,190
and people we should have a rumor that

586
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,870
if you use strength on a truck and push

587
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:58,640
to the way there'd be a Mew there and

588
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:01,130
that is not the case that doesn't

589
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:07,580
actually happen but this is a fake say

590
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:09,650
file where we do that it was actually

591
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:14,299
set up to demonstrate this other glitch

592
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:20,740
or because Jen wanted to show that when

593
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:20,740
we when this was done' night at agdq but

594
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:35,660
customizes one all that's changed is the

595
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:37,280
points the new code is one that is

596
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:46,819
called from the over old code every

597
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:50,030
frame and so that was used to like to

598
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:56,590
make it possible for there to actually

599
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:56,590
be you under the truck let's kill it

600
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,290
that's that

601
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,170
you

602
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:14,869
yeah yeah that one actually happened

603
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:17,330
because kind of modifying the party to

604
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:22,070
like look like what someone might have

605
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:24,049
had went back then I didn't do the I

606
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:28,970
didn't change the experience in editions

607
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:35,750
of the level so does that happen but it

608
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:37,700
went over well with their last place

609
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:39,980
that was level 40 instead but it had

610
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:43,359
enough XP to be like level 100 already

611
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,359
it just got a little bit more

612
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:54,890
yeah yeah we touched a bit on how all

613
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:58,519
due to the rumors like this a lot of

614
00:36:54,890 --> 00:37:01,519
like more complicated setups were

615
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:01,519
disbelieved

616
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:07,880
like talk to a guy walk over here wait

617
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:11,259
30 minutes and walk back and you get the

618
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:15,520
impossible doesn't exist Pokemon

619
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:18,079
and this was the inner flower mu

620
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,030
so-called mucilage that not even be

621
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,180
believed by a lot of people for the

622
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:25,579
first few months after that was first

623
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:29,750
posted and like if we took one of our

624
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:35,839
routes them somehow sent it back to two

625
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:39,849
thousands would believe it I think oh no

626
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,849
you can't have your items like

627
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:49,779
and there are other cases in the games

628
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:54,500
were where something is not right about

629
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:58,000
what the game does but a subtle way that

630
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,000
causes them to not be noticed

631
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:06,890
like it's matches between us the

632
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:09,589
subtitle you just fit check whether you

633
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:11,450
encounter something wild as opposed and

634
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:13,849
the different one being used to check

635
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:19,868
whether it's a land or water one which

636
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:22,579
is what causes the extent which is the

637
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:24,170
bronco surfing glitch that happen where

638
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:25,910
you sort of talk to the old man and

639
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:27,770
gives you a catching tutorial it

640
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:30,500
displays a cutscene where it displays

641
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:32,660
old man as your name it has to store

642
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,339
your name somewhere and they just sort

643
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,170
of said hey let's store it in the sort

644
00:38:34,339 --> 00:38:38,509
of table of wild Pokemon that you can

645
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:42,560
encounter so then typically the table

646
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:44,540
for land land encounters and then off of

647
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,869
our coast there's a few tiles you can

648
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:50,630
encounter on Pokemon but there's land

649
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:52,849
tiles I think yeah so then it just

650
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:55,190
checks the old man table if you haven't

651
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:57,650
walked in any grass recently that's why

652
00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:00,020
people might have said oh yeah I like I

653
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:03,079
encounter a Rhyhorn in the ocean it was

654
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:05,960
weird that's actually possible if you do

655
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:08,270
it I'll so the text that shows up when

656
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,369
you use the Quinn case in gold and

657
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:12,859
silver is not properly terminated in the

658
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:17,569
English Channel and that causes the

659
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:22,940
instruction pointer to go instead of

660
00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:25,700
memory that is used for sound effect

661
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:27,440
processing among other things it so

662
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:30,069
happens that in most cases it will very

663
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,829
soon encounter return instructions so

664
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:37,490
nothing appears that have happened in

665
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:38,960
this cases but if you had certain

666
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:41,509
sequences of sound effects played

667
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,369
recently they're convenient increment

668
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:45,640
stack winner instruction in there which

669
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:47,660
causes all sorts of fun things to happen

670
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,759
remember hearing a rumor about if you

671
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:51,710
like talk to a certain the Pokemon had

672
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,339
heard its cry and did that it would

673
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:54,339
crash the game

674
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:03,980
and for the rest of the school

675
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:08,309
yeah

676
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:25,579
so one of the things that yellow hat is

677
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:29,359
the red and blue don't is the Iike cube

678
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:32,349
found around the overworld and there are

679
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,348
some places where

680
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:45,029
where she was just need to go somewhere

681
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:49,380
and not move for a little bit if you got

682
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:52,070
a wash screen then your steps are

683
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,070
buffered

684
00:40:55,490 --> 00:41:01,160
and this isn't cleared out because

685
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:06,970
because she wasn't being made to move

686
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:06,970
and this can go out over memory after it

687
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,710
you

688
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:21,319
if we scroll down to our

689
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:24,000
ass face

690
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,480
here we go

691
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:34,089
and if we step into this building he

692
00:41:32,109 --> 00:41:36,900
could use fast left area and goes over

693
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:36,900
to talk to it

694
00:41:37,819 --> 00:41:42,160
and if we move around a bunch

695
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,990
you can see that

696
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,720
I want you to ones and to this

697
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:51,890
representing are the directions of our

698
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:55,939
steps God written me out there and

699
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:59,230
actually will go over

700
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,230
other variables

701
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:11,299
and crash the either crash the game

702
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:15,409
where make worse off locket

703
00:42:11,299 --> 00:42:18,339
but we can instead target what we're

704
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:18,339
corrupting with it

705
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:30,069
cause there to be a sign that you can

706
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:30,069
read in that room that doesn't exist

707
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:37,720
Oh

708
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,720
to do that

709
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:43,390
you

710
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,000
yes

711
00:42:53,710 --> 00:43:00,550
there's the it's the number of signs on

712
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:04,400
the current map that is there are seven

713
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:07,130
different ones in million city

714
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,970
and if we walk inside there are no signs

715
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,970
inside here

716
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:18,049
Oh buddy carefully counting her steps

717
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:39,960
and Pikachu on screen again who 3:10 so

718
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:43,450
we wrote a four to the number of signs

719
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:45,700
we had to do to that place

720
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:47,500
because to get that for we had to step

721
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:51,040
right which brings Pikachu back one

722
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:55,640
screen so we had to go from the end and

723
00:43:51,040 --> 00:44:00,330
work back to that

724
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:04,290
but then it created an invisible sign

725
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:08,460
after the title that I am now facing and

726
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:11,060
because the because the text pointer has

727
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,060
never got

728
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:19,799
didn't get cleared because there

729
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:19,800
normally wouldn't be any need to do it

730
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:29,400
you now have the text event index that

731
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:33,029
would be invoked if I talk to this tile

732
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:37,050
go past the end of the text table that's

733
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:37,050
where this ends

734
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:49,520
and do text instructions from Graham

735
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:52,520
which we have which we have set up to

736
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,520
contain

737
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:05,640
the Catana come in to execute code after

738
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,640
it

739
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:10,660
so if we do that we will

740
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:15,260
to that and will I put a break put in

741
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,260
there

742
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:24,339
I thought with this this had to be put

743
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:27,759
into the the experience field of our

744
00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:32,160
fifth if it's Pokemon being up here

745
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,160
I had to there was a lot of

746
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:38,328
finding a rail through the part of the

747
00:45:37,009 --> 00:45:40,009
game that would give you the exact

748
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:42,049
amount of sad experience you would need

749
00:45:40,009 --> 00:45:43,939
to get there to be that command to

750
00:45:42,049 --> 00:45:47,959
execute code followed by a jump

751
00:45:43,939 --> 00:45:51,259
instruction whose destination is also in

752
00:45:47,959 --> 00:45:53,660
RAM which ended up being the focus flags

753
00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:56,829
so we had to make sure you saw things

754
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:58,759
that would not what is there to be

755
00:45:56,829 --> 00:46:02,619
instructions there that would crash the

756
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:07,459
game you end up going into the item list

757
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:13,930
so you had so I had to construct code in

758
00:46:07,459 --> 00:46:19,430
that item list without would get the

759
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:23,118
that would give you a sack of 255 of an

760
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:25,209
item and with the and then return to the

761
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,549
game so you could actually continue

762
00:46:25,209 --> 00:46:30,979
playing I had to get to do this within

763
00:46:28,549 --> 00:46:36,729
the in-game budget but you would have by

764
00:46:30,979 --> 00:46:36,729
that point and then you can use

765
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:42,839
you

766
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,840
you

767
00:46:54,540 --> 00:47:07,520
if you move that stack of items up

768
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:07,520
you can then start throwing away items

769
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:15,339
right here is the number is the length

770
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:19,359
of that list but it's not just counted

771
00:47:15,339 --> 00:47:22,299
but also has a terminator of weight so

772
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:27,640
only the bottom only the first bit of it

773
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:29,560
is actually getting moved off and if we

774
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:33,569
get that counter down to one that's the

775
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,570
highlighted buddy to the other there and

776
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:43,210
we can then do a little sequence here

777
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:46,410
that tricks the game into decrementing

778
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:50,740
it when it's already 0 by emerging

779
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:52,598
stacks of the same item you can use that

780
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:55,410
to the scroll out into the memory that's

781
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:55,410
tested

782
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:04,109
and you can swap pairs of weights around

783
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,830
so essentially even pokemon red

784
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:13,290
inventories only supposed to be so long

785
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:14,819
we made the game think that it was much

786
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:19,320
longer than that speaking this sort of

787
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:20,880
go down and do stuff Anna wants us there

788
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,440
lettuce which I have done our inventory

789
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,380
to sort of keep it organized if we want

790
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,900
this lets us also switch around likes

791
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:30,360
because actually there's a bite of what

792
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:32,580
item is and then a bite of how many

793
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,650
stuff is in the bite yeah you can also

794
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:36,150
decrease every other bite by tossing

795
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:38,060
items as long as the game doesn't

796
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:43,730
consider that to be a key I don't wear

797
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:43,730
fur that is so

798
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:51,599
so if we twist that

799
00:48:54,600 --> 00:49:01,490
then we've rewritten the war

800
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,490
but the bottom of this to go directly to

801
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:12,890
here did not hear what I didn't do that

802
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:16,550
quite right but that was going to go to

803
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:19,250
the like directly the the hall of famer

804
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:22,430
than the game which was like just

805
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:24,560
getting a setup for doing that as as

806
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:26,589
fast as possible was the reason why I

807
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,849
did this this route has been

808
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:31,490
significantly improved many times since

809
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:35,270
then but for a while something derived

810
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:37,939
from it was the like for a few months of

811
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:43,609
early 2015 is something like this was

812
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:47,740
the route for the pokemon yellow 80% new

813
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:47,740
speed no safe corruption category

814
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:56,240
and that was a thing but that's

815
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,790
that's

816
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:09,170
the community the phret who made the

817
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:17,450
team that made the content of the same

818
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:19,910
please also too tas bot who that's like

819
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:22,009
that team

820
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:27,049
uh accomplishes all sorts of fun things

821
00:50:22,009 --> 00:50:32,750
by eating a bite reconstructed input to

822
00:50:27,049 --> 00:50:35,690
different games and systems and the head

823
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:38,420
of a team I see did a great clock at

824
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:41,240
DEFCON 24 about about that and I

825
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:44,000
recommend watching that and there are

826
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:49,629
various locks at different speed events

827
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,630
that they've been to - yes I have

828
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,220
that's

829
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:58,210
Hey

830
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,210
set of questions

831
