1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,740
Blue team engagement and in your daily

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,090
life as a cybersecurity practitioner

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,490
because some of the skills that have

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,170
built Who am I I'm a cybersecurity

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,830
practice lead for Appalachian

6
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:17,180
technologies which is Ryan made-up title

7
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,950
I do a lot of different things I do a

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,350
lot of red teaming penetration testing

9
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:24,220
of blue teaming and on both sides of the

10
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:26,420
fence adjunct adjunct professor for

11
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,538
Harrisburg University and the University

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,039
of Phoenix takes up a lot of my extra

13
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:34,250
free time because I love teaching I

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:37,249
think it's a big thing in this industry

15
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,670
to help be peers and mentors to each

16
00:00:37,249 --> 00:00:41,960
other to help increase the level of

17
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,870
understanding education in our

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,440
environment I do have a master's degree

19
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:52,519
that cost me way too much money

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,260
but like now so moving moving along and

21
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,850
I've been a longtime chess teacher and

22
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,428
player I played chess in high school

23
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,499
it's been a big passion of mine for a

24
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:02,329
long time so it's gonna be fun we're

25
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:05,920
gonna bridge the gap between these two

26
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,920
worlds so what is

27
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:09,040
yes absolutely

28
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,250
that's true I did found besides

29
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,960
Harrisburg and it is a fun event if you

30
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,210
didn't get to it this year come to it

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,919
next year it's gonna be at the end of

32
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,539
August next year and more information

33
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,370
will be incoming about that so love to

34
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:27,080
see everyone who's here there too and

35
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:30,650
vice versa so what is chess this is an

36
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:33,950
ancient board game one of the first

37
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:36,680
strategy board games it's over fifteen

38
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:40,340
hundred years old and they can't really

39
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,400
pin the exact date on it the thing

40
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,290
that's interesting about chess is unlike

41
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,900
a lot of things especially in

42
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:50,660
cybersecurity the rules of chess don't

43
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:53,300
really change like at all

44
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:55,160
the the last rule change was you know

45
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,920
somewhere in the 1900s and for the most

46
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:01,039
part they're small rule changes for

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,410
tournament games the basic rules of the

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,720
game have not changed in a very long

49
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:10,100
time so it's very stable so if you read

50
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:12,530
a book about chess from the 1900s it

51
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,940
would still be very applicable today how

52
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,330
many people can say you know they have a

53
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:20,250
cybersecurity book that's 90 years old

54
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:23,850
that's still viable right

55
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,710
very few right so how many people here

56
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,750
have ever played chess before show of

57
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,040
hands

58
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,980
awesome so most people here so here's a

59
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,690
quick reminder of some of the ways of

60
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,869
different pieces move we have the pawn

61
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:39,510
which is the lowest that's our foot

62
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,030
soldiers but they can promote to any

63
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,250
potential piece that you want once they

64
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,260
get to the other end of the board and in

65
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,050
most circumstances you'll promote to a

66
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,929
queen you have your knight and your

67
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,580
bishop your knight moves in an l-shape

68
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,440
your bishop moves diagonally your rook

69
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,540
can move horizontally or vertically and

70
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,490
your queen is she's the all-powerful

71
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,900
person she's the one really running the

72
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:06,600
show right and he's just really powerful

73
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,000
and moving anywhere diagonally or

74
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,859
horizontally or vertically and then the

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,980
King if you lose the King you'll lose

76
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,990
the game but he can move one square in

77
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,810
any direction

78
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,970
so how many people are familiar with the

79
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,200
point system has ever used a point

80
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,480
system in chess

81
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,369
I know a lot of people but when you

82
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,950
start getting into competitive chess you

83
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,170
have to figure out a way to know how

84
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:36,339
you're doing in the game even though the

85
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:39,010
game's objective is to get checkmate you

86
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,350
have to kind of know how you're doing

87
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,600
while you're playing the game there's a

88
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,790
numerical system that's often used in

89
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,250
chess tournaments and by players to

90
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:51,220
figure out how you're doing and it all

91
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,230
starts with points or one pawn every

92
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,780
pawn is worth one point a bishop and a

93
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:58,299
knight are worth about three or oak is

94
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:03,100
five and a queen is nine the King

95
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:05,170
doesn't have a specific you can't

96
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,269
sacrifice the king that doesn't work in

97
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,850
this game but if we were to give it a

98
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:12,489
power level so to speak we would

99
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,019
probably give it a three because of his

100
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,500
ability to move in any direction at

101
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:19,418
least one space now another thing to

102
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,649
consider is certain players will rate

103
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:22,990
certain things a little bit more

104
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:25,120
powerful and rating than others it's

105
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,310
generally advised if you have both your

106
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,440
bishops they consider that almost like

107
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,620
half a point an advantage because you

108
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,719
can cover more squares with two bishops

109
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,820
and rather than two knights the

110
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,740
situation of the game may change but

111
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,050
this is a good idea as you're playing to

112
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,050
know whether you're doing well in the

113
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,940
game or if you're down by a lot and it's

114
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:51,130
gonna take a lot of strategy in order to

115
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:53,650
try and win come back from a loss so

116
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,150
some basic opening principles of the

117
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,539
game of chess one of the things you want

118
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:02,340
to do is control the center a good

119
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:04,539
example of this if we look at a knight

120
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,690
there's this old expression called a

121
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:10,690
knight on the rim is grim that's often

122
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,190
used by odd chess players and the reason

123
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,719
that is is a knight that is near the

124
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:17,320
center of the board can move eight

125
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,810
squares as he gets to the very edge of

126
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:24,099
the board if he's in and want any of the

127
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:26,229
corners you only moved to and in general

128
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:29,560
that's practice for every single chess

129
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:30,969
piece you have the more central control

130
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,500
you have or the closer they are to the

131
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,960
center the more options and

132
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,010
possibilities you have during World War

133
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,020
two there was

134
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,000
concept known as no-man's land right if

135
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,890
you went out into no-man's land you

136
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,810
would get shot no one controlled the

137
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,909
center of the battlefield when you're

138
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,830
talking about strategy and tactics one

139
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,450
of the things is you want control of the

140
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,370
center of the battlefield if you have

141
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,880
control of it you're gonna have an

142
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:57,880
advantage against your opponent versus

143
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,640
if you don't so central control in the

144
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,830
game is very important another two other

145
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,169
basic opening strategies you don't want

146
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,700
to move your queen out too early a lot

147
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,160
of people tend to do that you don't

148
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,300
wanna move the same piece twice and the

149
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,250
reason you don't want to move the same

150
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,980
piece choice is this thing that we call

151
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,680
tempo and chest in tempo is basically

152
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:19,630
the advantage when one player makes a

153
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,420
move another player has to react and

154
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:24,870
we'll talk about that more because this

155
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,670
happens a lot in cyber security when a

156
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,770
red teamer makes a move and a blue team

157
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,750
has to react we'll talk about the

158
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,280
parallels a little bit but we'll see

159
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,340
that a lot so you don't want to move the

160
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,219
same piece twice because you're losing

161
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,840
time and potentially losing an advantage

162
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,900
you could have the other thing you want

163
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,150
to do is castle early you want to defend

164
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,460
your king or your valuables just like in

165
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:51,878
an organization want to fend the data

166
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:54,758
that's important to an organization

167
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:57,339
so chest tactics 101 we're gonna talk

168
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,459
about the skewer so the first one we're

169
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:03,639
going to talk about is the skewer which

170
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:05,560
is attacking a powerful piece

171
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,060
to obtain another piece so we're

172
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,689
attacking a piece through a different

173
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:14,379
piece so for example here in our diagram

174
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:16,569
we're removing the Bishop to c4 and

175
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:19,449
we're attacking the Queen the Queen can

176
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:23,949
move but in the direction of the Queen

177
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:25,840
the rook is placed on g8 now if we do

178
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:28,469
the math on that if we were to lose a

179
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,349
rook and the Queen then takes the bishop

180
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:35,710
we lost two points so the advantage then

181
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:38,110
goes to wipe so by using skewers you can

182
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,628
pick up additional points and attack

183
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,550
through different obstacles when we're

184
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:43,509
talking about cybersecurity often we

185
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,960
have to look at things a little

186
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:47,860
differently and sometimes our

187
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,080
adversaries especially when we're in

188
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,509
charge of defending an organization will

189
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,919
attack it using methods and we don't

190
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:57,099
really think about they'll go through an

191
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,529
intermediary to attack right what's the

192
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:01,419
what's the newest way that a lot of bad

193
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:03,550
guys gain systems well they attack the

194
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:06,008
the user right the social engineering

195
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,139
will they find some other way to attack

196
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:09,400
maybe it's via physical access maybe

197
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:11,860
it's per trying to be a pizza guy

198
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,318
there's different ways that people can

199
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,529
get in this is a very what the tactic

200
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,839
for this is not an old tactic I mean not

201
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:23,110
a new tactic that's that reversal

202
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:27,219
it's an old tactic made new in

203
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:30,550
cybersecurity this is a basic tactic can

204
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:33,610
you take advantage of something that's

205
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,570
defending or blocking and attack that to

206
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,120
get to something else

207
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,459
a recent cybersecurity attack from a

208
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,149
year ago that I heard that someone was

209
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:46,660
actually employing was they would do SD

210
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:49,089
main computer systems the forced backup

211
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:52,000
systems on an organization to come

212
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:57,339
online those backup systems weren't as

213
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:01,600
patched as the standard operating their

214
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:03,010
normal everyday system so in in essence

215
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,790
this was a skewer attack they were

216
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:08,560
attacking through a different piece to

217
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,519
get the data they were trying to get

218
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,439
through this is how some of these

219
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,630
tactics even though we don't see them

220
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,340
you still apply in a lot of interesting

221
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,650
ways

222
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:20,950
so what's the next tactic we have in

223
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:23,500
chess is be fork which is attacking more

224
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,390
than one piece at once because you can't

225
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,340
be everywhere it wants even though in

226
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:29,500
cybersecurity it always seems like we're

227
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:32,050
pulled in a lot of different directions

228
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:36,210
all the time this is the tactic often

229
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:40,209
employed in guess when you're splitting

230
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:42,339
the ability for your opponent to react

231
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:45,210
in this case we're attacking both the

232
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:47,560
king and the bishop at the same time

233
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,570
White's only going to be able to move

234
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,969
the King and it's going to lose the

235
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:57,070
bishop there is no way the king can get

236
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:59,339
to protecting the bishop so we can see

237
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,339
this

238
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,320
causing a distraction

239
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:08,350
potentially and confusing an opponent

240
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:11,280
and potentially work when you're talking

241
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,280
about a compromise

242
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:19,810
tactic is the pen so making a pen is

243
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:22,390
when you take a piece and it is unable

244
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:26,439
to move because it's protecting another

245
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:29,260
piece so in this example we have we

246
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:33,100
moved our knight as black white is

247
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:37,290
unable to move the bishop because the

248
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:40,590
rook can then take the case and elude

249
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,589
the pen

250
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,370
is ensuring that

251
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,870
stuck because it's defending a higher

252
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,870
piece

253
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:56,850
certain systems that could be

254
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,680
potentially pinned or stuck to other

255
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,350
systems are attached to other systems

256
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,870
oftentimes when we talk about attacking

257
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,249
a web application what's connected to a

258
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,210
web application normally there's a

259
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:08,980
database

260
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:12,010
when you look at these things well maybe

261
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,600
we can't attack the the web application

262
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,490
but we know there's a database behind it

263
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,070
or we can attack the database and then

264
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:20,990
get to the web application couple

265
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,610
different ways you can look at that

266
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,860
this is probably well my favorite

267
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:29,360
tactics which is called remove the

268
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:32,830
defender the idea here is as black I'm

269
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,650
going to attack the the knight and

270
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:38,960
remove that and then check the King so

271
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:41,920
the King has to the pawn has to take the

272
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,360
knight and then the Queen will be

273
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,309
undefended

274
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:51,199
on b5 so if I'm gonna trade a fish up

275
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:53,540
for the night then I'm gonna get the

276
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:54,829
Queen for free that's nine points right

277
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,009
that's gonna give me a significant

278
00:11:54,829 --> 00:12:00,109
advantage but before the smooth the

279
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:03,079
queen was defended by the knight

280
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:04,579
so if the Queen took the Queen it would

281
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:06,888
be okay because I'd be nine for nine

282
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:09,290
what we've done is removed the defender

283
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:12,130
who can think of in cybersecurity the

284
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:15,530
tactic of removing the defender

285
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:18,980
well maybe disable antivirus

286
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:20,630
maybe stop logs from getting to where

287
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,400
they need to be intercepting logs or

288
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,620
stopping the log files from going to the

289
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,350
the SEM or poisoning laws there's lots

290
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,150
of examples we see in cybersecurity

291
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:33,430
where the defender the defensive

292
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:33,430
mechanisms are removed on a device

293
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,820
whoops

294
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,260
look at some live demos because it's

295
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,790
much more fun

296
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,700
I see a lot of people when they first

297
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:48,730
play a chess game they're often going to

298
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,470
be tempted to do something like this if

299
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,990
you've ever done this you don't need to

300
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,550
feel bad about doing this but in general

301
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:57,190
you see a lot of people do this and the

302
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,930
reason they do that is because they

303
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:02,170
think by getting this out because the

304
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:05,979
rook is powerful it can move a lot of

305
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:08,020
different spaces and cause a lot of

306
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:12,660
havoc here but normally what ends up

307
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,660
happening is if you see this move

308
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,250
we'll just move here and then when you

309
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,460
move your rook up it's just going to

310
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:23,040
take it with the bishop and now I'm not

311
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:25,590
a math wizard but 5-3 I just lost two

312
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,349
points and I tend to like to keep my

313
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:30,360
rocks so that's not a bad that's not a

314
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,580
good strategy and in general when we're

315
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,910
talking about chefs we want to control

316
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:37,680
the center so this does not attack or

317
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:41,939
control the center so a more ideal

318
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,219
position when you start as white is you

319
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,500
want to do a move that's going to give

320
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,090
you more central control and often in

321
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,770
games if you look at what a lot about

322
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,210
chess professionals because there are

323
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:55,170
some people that actually make money off

324
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:58,560
this they will start by moving and doing

325
00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:00,959
a move more like this and the reason for

326
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,760
that is because the center of the board

327
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,410
these four pieces right here is

328
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:09,240
generally where you want to have more

329
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:11,040
control of the board because here this

330
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,400
piece is in the center it's now

331
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,680
attacking this this spot so it's giving

332
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,569
me some central control the other thing

333
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,459
is now these pieces the bishop and the

334
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:23,310
Queen are now free to move throughout

335
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:26,370
the board so now I've developed my

336
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:28,920
pieces because now I have more freedom

337
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:31,470
in what I'm able to do and normally

338
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,410
black will return in kind and will tend

339
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:38,780
to do this move because they don't want

340
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:38,780
you be able to do something

341
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:44,900
like if they went here this would be a

342
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:48,590
very beautiful move to do because then

343
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:52,310
you have a very nice opening and control

344
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:55,389
here of the board that and prevent a lot

345
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:58,089
of options for black

346
00:14:55,389 --> 00:15:00,129
so typical opening you might see and I

347
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:01,089
see quite often is something along the

348
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:03,399
lines of this

349
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:05,230
the reason the nice come out again is

350
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:06,160
because when they're in this square

351
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,189
right here

352
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,110
they can move eight bases but more

353
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:13,839
particularly because they move in an L

354
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:17,079
the night attacks this spot and this

355
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,309
spot which is central control right so

356
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:20,979
if I'm moving the night here that's

357
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:23,709
attacking this fall the reason black

358
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,049
then moves here is because it's

359
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:29,079
defending that pawn so you see how white

360
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:32,290
is moving black is reacting but when the

361
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:34,420
game first starts and in general this is

362
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,540
true white actually starts with the

363
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:39,729
advantage they get to go first

364
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,259
until they potentially mess up or do a

365
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:44,589
move that allowed black to

366
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:47,470
counter-attack very similar when we're

367
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:49,899
talking in cybersecurity or when we're

368
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:52,559
cybersecurity professionals are we white

369
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:52,559
or black

370
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:59,990
definitely black right because we have

371
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:02,810
to react what the bad guys are doing and

372
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:05,600
in some cases we're not really allowed

373
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:07,760
to counter-attack either we can defend

374
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,620
but we can't actually attack back right

375
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,800
at least I didn't pass that law to hack

376
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:16,070
back which will be a mess if they do but

377
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,550
as we see here there's a lot of back and

378
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:21,350
forth reacting so what the what would

379
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,660
White's next move be

380
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:26,120
well white might try and remove the

381
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:29,930
defender right so it might attack here

382
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:33,050
and then if black maybe wanted to force

383
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:36,140
white to do something white could go

384
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:38,589
here black could go here and what

385
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,589
happens

386
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:45,609
well white removed the defender now this

387
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:49,600
is an actually ideal opening because

388
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:53,850
there's a little trick here but as you

389
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,850
can see if we look at the the pieces

390
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,100
that whites actually now off upon now

391
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,019
black will get back to pawn because this

392
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,329
isn't a great example of remove defender

393
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:07,789
but that's the basic concept is we

394
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:10,129
remove the defender and we've also done

395
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:14,720
what's known as double dot pawn this

396
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:17,000
reduces maneuverability and is dangerous

397
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,579
as the game goes on because now you

398
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,799
can't move this pawn at all the only

399
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:23,270
saving grace to this double dot pawns is

400
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:25,280
at least you're still attacking the

401
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,809
center but in general it's going to be

402
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,629
very difficult for you to move these

403
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:32,450
pieces because now they're doubled out

404
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:36,370
even worse would have been if black were

405
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,370
to have done potentially this

406
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,230
well actually that that might be better

407
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:42,909
because then what black can do is move

408
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:46,260
this out here and this is in the center

409
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:46,260
and defended by the pawn

410
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,290
you

411
00:17:53,630 --> 00:18:00,169
so back to our example here the reason

412
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,710
this is an ideal for white is because

413
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:06,789
when the Queen goes here

414
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:11,109
what are whites option

415
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:12,609
because white could do this to defend

416
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:16,198
the night but that doesn't look too good

417
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:16,198
because I'm black can move here

418
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,880
bad because you can do here but now

419
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:25,740
you're kind of over stretch with your

420
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:30,299
palm structure and it could cause some

421
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:34,309
issues if white moves back though now

422
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:34,309
white loses a pawn and Shaq

423
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:42,449
and what is then white has to move here

424
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,450
black can't move because

425
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,080
what has happened to blacks wing

426
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:56,150
is

427
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:56,149
and do the Kings you can't look

428
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:01,000
black the only real option unless you

429
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:04,179
want to do something like just defending

430
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,590
it is really to take the Queen then you

431
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:10,000
end up with kind of an interesting

432
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:11,590
opening like that and notice a lot of

433
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,050
the pieces are all coming out through

434
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:16,270
the center when you're playing a chess

435
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:18,610
game unless you have a good reason to

436
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,200
these three pieces over here and these

437
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,550
three over here you don't have to move a

438
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,920
whole lot unless you have a specific

439
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:26,230
strategy for why you need to move almost

440
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:30,520
all your pieces can come out through the

441
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:32,290
two Center spots and if you employ this

442
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:36,250
strategy and allow the chess games you

443
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:38,490
play for people who aren't pro chess

444
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,660
players or study this stuff just

445
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:43,360
employing some of these tactics you'll

446
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,250
find you'll win a lot more games because

447
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,110
in general you'll have central control

448
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,790
and you'll be able to use this to your

449
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:53,010
advantage to quickly pick up points and

450
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:53,010
when your games then brag about it

451
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,970
you

452
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:08,658
yes actually you have the and one of the

453
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:13,339
ideas will go back here and do a

454
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:15,649
different example is this is typical and

455
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:18,109
you might hear this called sometimes if

456
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:21,549
anyone here plays chess there's certain

457
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:27,079
openings for example this opening here

458
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:28,668
is known as the roy lopez and they named

459
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:31,188
it because that was the first guy who

460
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:33,019
did it and then coach now credit for it

461
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:36,379
so they're named after famous chess

462
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:39,319
players who use these opening but

463
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:41,029
basically an opening is a set of really

464
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,959
good moves or the best moves in a

465
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:43,609
certain situation

466
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:46,129
so you're here people in chess talk

467
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:47,718
about what's your opening strategy and

468
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:49,339
people are like well I don't I don't

469
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:53,539
play with the strategy I just kind of

470
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:54,799
play and it's not so much a strategy

471
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:56,599
when you're talking about openings

472
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,270
there's just a set of probably the best

473
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:01,480
moves

474
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:03,460
from a given situation and we can know

475
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,170
that a little bit because if you notice

476
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,170
here on the side this little computer

477
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:10,570
algorithm here this is an analysis board

478
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:12,490
from chess comm will actually go back

479
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:15,550
and tell me how good my moves were based

480
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:17,679
off what the computer that uh this would

481
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,240
be a better move because 400 move down

482
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,559
you know you could have this advantage

483
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,690
if you would have made this move over

484
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,000
that way we have that ability now with

485
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,590
computing it'll tell you how good your

486
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,350
moves are so a lot of people who do

487
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,909
professional participating professional

488
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:35,649
chess tournaments they use tools like

489
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:37,120
this to analyze but for our example this

490
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,309
is fine so this is what a typical

491
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,649
opening would look like and then the

492
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:45,370
game would pretty much proceed from here

493
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:47,380
after castling very likely black will do

494
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,689
something like this white will likely go

495
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,700
here and you end up with something like

496
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:55,350
this so notice that both Kings are now

497
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:58,000
castled there's a lot of back and forth

498
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:59,800
regarding central control white is

499
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,220
likely to do something like either this

500
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:05,260
or they might go for for this although

501
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,900
likely they could also try bringing out

502
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:12,360
the bishop and pin this knight to the

503
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:14,679
Queen potentially potentially forcing

504
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:17,260
black to kind of want to kick them out

505
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:18,940
of there and change the pawn structure a

506
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:21,250
little but there's a lot of things that

507
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,630
can happen from just this setup and this

508
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,630
is just very common

509
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,410
you

510
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:37,330
all right so what can chests teach us

511
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,980
about cybersecurity I've tried to make

512
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,080
some parallels as we went through the

513
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:43,890
presentation but in general it's about

514
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:46,149
thinking creatively when we think about

515
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:48,370
adversaries and attackers that's what

516
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:50,410
they're doing nowadays is they come up

517
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:53,799
with a lot of creative ways to get into

518
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:56,200
systems as defenders were doing our best

519
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:57,820
to do a better job to cover the basics

520
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,580
right we've gotten to the point where we

521
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:03,189
even have something as vast as the mitre

522
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:06,010
attack framework that is detailing each

523
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:10,049
and every dirty tactic that's being used

524
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:10,049
to get into systems and exfiltrate data

525
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:15,639
well one of the things because we're

526
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:17,080
defending right we're black we kind of

527
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,110
have to be ready for whatever whites

528
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:22,960
going to do just like in a chess game so

529
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:25,809
we need to be prepared for what the next

530
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,760
thing the bad guys are going to do and

531
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:30,070
kind of think creatively are there

532
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,290
things in our environments that we work

533
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,490
in that they may be able to take

534
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,889
advantage of that we haven't really

535
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,360
thought about before and another thing

536
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,700
to look at is look for some of those

537
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,370
similar tactics via the skewer fork and

538
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:45,070
pen what are things that if a

539
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:46,840
coordinated or combinate combination

540
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,850
attack was done on the organization

541
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,320
now maybe you're defending really well

542
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,840
on this end but if these two things

543
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,689
lined up with an adversary be able to

544
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:59,260
potentially a combination attack against

545
00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:01,420
the system and cause issues and removing

546
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:03,220
the defender I mean we think about this

547
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,740
I think about when I'm pen testing

548
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:08,559
systems and I disable a B I've removed

549
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,179
the defender right now my disable live

550
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,629
protection now my malware role runs

551
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:15,460
because a B won't detect it and the best

552
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,690
part is then if I disable there a B I

553
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,670
don't have to worry about AV evasion

554
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,980
because it just disabled it and if they

555
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:24,010
aren't tracking when it's enabled or

556
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,720
disabled they wouldn't know but there's

557
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,910
lots of cases where we could potentially

558
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,160
remove the defender and environment

559
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:32,710
whether it's confusing

560
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,770
the logs erasing logs a lot of things

561
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:37,920
that could happen from our Red Team Blue

562
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:39,980
Team perspective

563
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,980
you

564
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:45,770
oh and that was it any questions

565
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,100
you

566
00:24:52,950 --> 00:25:02,830
cybersecurity teach about Shou great

567
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:05,649
question I think as I do a lot with

568
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:07,539
cybersecurity it helps me to continue to

569
00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:09,969
think creatively especially when I do a

570
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:11,649
lot of pentesting engagements and that

571
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:14,679
can help me when I'm doing chess games

572
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:17,820
too because I think of things just like

573
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:20,499
when I'm like gee this is my nmap scan

574
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,999
what's here that I could attack or how

575
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:24,789
could I get in well then I have to think

576
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:27,129
back oh well this company maybe I'll use

577
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:28,779
crunch and make a word list based off a

578
00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:30,639
bunch of key words off this company's

579
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:32,799
website and I'll try it against this SSH

580
00:25:30,639 --> 00:25:35,469
server and see if I can get in have to

581
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:38,080
think kind of what can I do here and

582
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:39,820
some of that thinking parallels back to

583
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:44,350
chess and when you're in a weird

584
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:46,840
situation part of the game is knowing

585
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:48,039
strat strategy and chess strategy but

586
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,389
the other part of the game is getting

587
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:51,610
into the head of your opponent and

588
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:53,979
knowing what they're gonna do if you can

589
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:56,949
predict what moves they're gonna do you

590
00:25:53,980 --> 00:26:00,249
can set up traps and ways to make them

591
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:02,049
fall into different avenues I think we

592
00:26:00,249 --> 00:26:03,879
see that becoming very popular in

593
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:06,039
cybersecurity we're setting up a lot

594
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:08,230
more honey pots a lot of honey traps and

595
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:10,960
now the new term that I see is now we

596
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:12,909
got honey tokens and honey accounts we

597
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,669
have fake accounts in company networks

598
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:17,379
because if someone does you know an LDAP

599
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:18,909
query on this fake account we know that

600
00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:21,789
this device has been compromised

601
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:24,999
no one should use that account ever so

602
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:28,119
we see some creative ways that it's it's

603
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:30,129
going back and forth in that way but I

604
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:32,049
think in general chess is a fun game I

605
00:26:30,129 --> 00:26:35,049
enjoy playing it and it can definitely

606
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:38,158
help with your creative thinking skills

607
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:38,158
and analytical

608
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:53,270
favorite opening probably has to be

609
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:56,879
either roy lopez of the four nights game

610
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:59,100
which it just provides a very open game

611
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,070
with a lot of different tactics and

612
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:04,199
strategies versus a close game there's

613
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:06,090
generally two kinds of games because you

614
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,040
can have an open game or a close game

615
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:10,530
you have a close game that means kind of

616
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:13,770
all your pawns are locked together so it

617
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:15,960
might look like a vertical across the

618
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:18,540
board when you have a close game it

619
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,310
means your bishops and your queens don't

620
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,020
have as much power because from a

621
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:24,300
diagonal perspective they're locked in

622
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:28,050
they can't do anything so the knight

623
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:31,460
becomes incredibly important I play

624
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:34,620
style I tend to be a more assertive

625
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:36,420
player so I tend to like open games

626
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,429
where I can do a lot of tactics and set

627
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,670
up a lot of traps for my opponent when I

628
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,670
play

629
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:49,030
all right thank you so much

630
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,090
[Applause]

631
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,090
you

632
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,019
I'll be here
