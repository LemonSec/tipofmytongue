2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,519
hey

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:12,000
it's good to be talking to all of you in

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,000
some weird way that i get no feedback in

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,520
the usual laughter so i'll assume you're

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,520
all finding me amusing or something

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,560
um this is a talk i've been wanting to

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,759
give for a while

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:27,680
since a lot of my work is now in

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:31,800
the help to companies make a you know

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:34,399
merge together kind of like a version of

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,079
agar.io that doesn't freeze as much and

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,320
there's money involved

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,200
so this is what i've been doing for the

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,200
last couple of months

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,800
it helps i could twitch through okay

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,239
who am i i'm sure you've all seen the

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,640
slide before uh

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,760
i am now the mergers and acquisition

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,039
practice lead for

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,559
my employer leviathan security um

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,680
i also do a lot of grc and strategy work

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,878
outside of that i'm also a lawyer

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,199
i've got a new disclaimer now this is

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,960
not

26
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,080
investment nor tax advice it's not legal

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,039
advice

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,600
and i don't get to see a lot outside of

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,600
my bento box so don't ask me for like is

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,640
this a good idea to invest my money

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,798
because

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,799
i still hold pets.com stock

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,920
still to this day i mean because they're

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,280
eventually going to turn it around

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,439
so uh an overview of

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,400
why do we have mergers and acquisitions

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,479
you're uh

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,799
imagine you're a startup you're 35

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,280
people you've got a good idea

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,000
and it's not as good as you thought it

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,280
was

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,479
uh sometimes selling out

43
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,280
is better than remaining independent um

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,920
you aren't growing you aren't getting

45
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,880
the traction you wanted in the market

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,600
are your

47
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,679
big new product is just taking longer

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,640
and costing more money to finally get it

49
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,280
ready

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,119
so you are you need more runway you need

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,640
more money to finally like go and take

52
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,680
on the market and you're just not

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,120
getting it your existing

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,840
investors aren't interested

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,760
and from the buyer side sometimes there

56
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,720
are assets within a company that are

57
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,640
more valuable

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:24,319
not in that company a customer list

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,559
a brand uh a code base a product

60
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,679
a lot of times you'll see these smaller

61
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,280
startups so they'll start with like

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,120
we're going to go revolutionize this

63
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,400
industry and it gets narrower narrower

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,319
and there until you go

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,760
that's a really good tool for an edge

66
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,160
case and

67
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,000
someone who's in the business similar to

68
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,400
yours that's much larger may say

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,120
that's a great tool within our suite of

70
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,360
products

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,800
so you may get an offer from them saying

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,239
we would like to buy your company

73
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,480
because that tool would be really cool

74
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,440
to have

75
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,200
sometimes it's an aqua hire you have a

76
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,680
talented team of people

77
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,760
that you want to buy you want to acquire

78
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,200
the whole team and say you can do great

79
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,280
things

80
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,040
so that's why there's a market it's not

81
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,920
just people going out of business it

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,720
might be

83
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,280
existing companies that are someone says

84
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,120
hey

85
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,959
you would be more valuable as a part of

86
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,879
us

87
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,400
so valuation this is where you're

88
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,239
finally coming to the idea of

89
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,959
i would like to buy your company or we

90
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,599
would like to sell our company

91
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,319
what's the value what's the price and

92
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,798
that's

93
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,679
a little bit outside of the work i do

94
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,120
since my

95
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,239
thin niche of that is basically saying

96
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,640
here's where your baby's ugly um

97
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,000
here's where the price is a little too

98
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,079
high

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,120
um i think of myself as a housing

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,120
inspector

101
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,280
you may love the house it's great it's

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,560
got great light it's got great bones

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,959
whatever that means

104
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,920
the school district isn't you know voted

105
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,879
most dangerous

106
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,958
in the county for five years in a row uh

107
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:01,840
my job is to come in and go

108
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,840
well the foundation's also damaged well

109
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,640
you probably want new you probably want

110
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,959
to replace the electrical system because

111
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,879
the existing stuff is dangerous

112
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,640
so let's take some money off the table

113
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:18,560
to remediate those problems

114
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,120
so due diligence multiple teams come in

115
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,520
looking at the deal and say let's ask

116
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,400
questions about the company to find out

117
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,400
what the buyer is actually getting there

118
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,000
are financial ones they're going to go

119
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,599
look over the books they're teams of

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,080
accountants who are going to make sure

121
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,000
that

122
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,159
every time you say you've made a sale

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,600
you actually made that sale

124
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,280
there will be people who go over your

125
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,680
assets you have real estate you have

126
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,559
patent rights you have copyrights is

127
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,720
that worth

128
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,240
what you say it is is that worth that

129
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,479
much to us

130
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,479
can you actually say you own that thing

131
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,840
so they crawl over that

132
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,479
and then a part of due diligence is this

133
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,560
undiscovered or undisclosed

134
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,639
risks are there problems with your

135
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,400
company that don't appear on the balance

136
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,240
sheet

137
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,239
this is the category of where i live

138
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:14,160
some examples litigation risks right

139
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:18,000
um your product may have infringed on

140
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,039
somebody else's patent um your customers

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,960
some of them may

142
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,039
love you some of them may hate you so

143
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,599
much they've sued you

144
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,080
or you may have done something stupid

145
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,479
and

146
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,639
thus justified some kind of litigation

147
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,240
your products actually kill some people

148
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,160
well that's bad um more importantly to

149
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,199
us and cyber security is

150
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,880
breach and privacy risks is there

151
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:46,320
a unknown breach risk like consider when

152
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,320
verizon bought yahoo and yahoo failed to

153
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,759
disclose some fairly large breaches

154
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,520
along the way well that's something nice

155
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,800
to know if you're the buying company to

156
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,560
go

157
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,479
i'm getting these things am i also

158
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,039
getting something has negative value

159
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,080
like

160
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,520
an undiscovered breach are

161
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,758
we're starting to see where there are

162
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,039
privacy risks have you

163
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,479
gathered too much information unlawfully

164
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,159
that is going to make you look like a

165
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,840
schmuck a couple years from now if it

166
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,919
get once it gets out

167
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,119
right your company has certain amount of

168
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,479
value

169
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,840
if it appears on krebs amazingly enough

170
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:26,960
it's worth less i wonder why

171
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,479
so product risks um

172
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,479
these are this if you're thinking of

173
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,758
like a software company a sas company or

174
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,880
platform company

175
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,800
you've got the the stuff you're buying

176
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,840
isn't just the trademark it's this

177
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,199
actual

178
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,758
mass of code that makes it run is that

179
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,800
code

180
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,600
worse than you expected is it is it

181
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,120
vulnerable

182
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,319
is it crafty is it a bunch of tech debt

183
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,919
in a box

184
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,759
that you're going to have to clean up

185
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,719
once you buy it if you want to continue

186
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,960
operating stuff are there missing

187
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,000
controls in your infrastructure

188
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,840
that you're worried about right uh are

189
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,199
there things that you're expected to

190
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,679
have that you don't

191
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,880
like a sim like maybe vulnerability

192
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,639
management

193
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,120
maybe your infra is not up to snuff

194
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,479
and is it going to be really hard to fix

195
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,800
all this stuff

196
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,680
therefore expensive therefore does that

197
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,080
take some money

198
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,960
off the valuation when you actually go

199
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,960
to sign a deal

200
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,360
so tech debt i like to think of it as

201
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,039
remember that temporary work workaround

202
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,280
that's eight years old

203
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,880
um now you rely on it there are people

204
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,198
who actually are writing code

205
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,080
that uses that because it works better

206
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,160
now you you

207
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,039
that work around you you clutched in

208
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,520
there is now a part of your life

209
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,639
and to if you fix anything you're gonna

210
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,840
break their

211
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,720
their stuff um everyone has deferred

212
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,960
maintenance right

213
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,680
out of support hardware are operating

214
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,039
systems in your production environment

215
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,479
um that happens it's when your entire

216
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,440
production

217
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,199
infrastructure is running on obsolete

218
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,360
operating systems

219
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,720
and when you go why don't you patch

220
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,560
these and bring them up it's like well

221
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,800
that breaks the application

222
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,599
oh so you've got to rip out a bunch of

223
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,680
stuff

224
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:20,159
are uh a lot of times i see this where

225
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,759
it's it's not patched not only because

226
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,879
you didn't have the time

227
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,879
is that you don't even have the

228
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,199
orchestration to do it

229
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,120
the number of clients i've seen where

230
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,840
how do you do patches and it's when i

231
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,560
have time

232
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,838
i run patch i you know i click through

233
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,039
software update

234
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,599
like no orchestration no push out a

235
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,679
patch

236
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,680
test run nah if i have time i'd do it

237
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,680
so i like to think of those guys as we

238
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,760
patch once a year whether we need to or

239
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,399
not

240
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,120
missing parts you know i think of a

241
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,200
particular client of ours who

242
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,600
when i asked about a sim they explained

243
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,440
that they had a budget for that sin

244
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,880
and that it's like well when was that

245
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,560
well that was two years ago it's like

246
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,080
well what happened

247
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,800
and instead they bought something for

248
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,200
trade shows

249
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,800
and that is not actually a picture of it

250
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,240
that i could not get a picture of it

251
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,359
because that would disclose who the

252
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,080
client was

253
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,920
but all i can describe it was was a

254
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,360
large suv with a

255
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,439
bump and stereo and you know the return

256
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,560
of investment for a bump and stereo on a

257
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,120
cool ride

258
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,719
that's instant the sim does not pay off

259
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,839
as well

260
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,839
until you needed it

261
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,080
so on the buy side

262
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,959
you are the people buying us another

263
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,440
company

264
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:47,680
you want to know what you're getting um

265
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,800
so you're looking for discounts and deal

266
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,560
stoppers

267
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,920
discounts right you're just looking for

268
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,239
is there something that we're going to

269
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,719
have to fix to make this operational

270
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,000
that we take off the sale because we're

271
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,480
going to have to use that money to

272
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,519
instead

273
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,200
fix that problem right stuff you have to

274
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,920
put in place to meet

275
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,440
some minimal standards for that industry

276
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,439
are you gonna have to hire people

277
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,160
because you don't have anyone doing that

278
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,079
work

279
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,000
do you have to go through your existing

280
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,079
code base and refactor it because you're

281
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,279
using

282
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,120
no longer supported languages are no

283
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,160
longer supported operating systems or

284
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,920
something like that where you just have

285
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,800
to fix the old stuff

286
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,640
do you have existing breach or liability

287
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,599
offsets that you have to you have to pay

288
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,720
for right

289
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,240
you've got um you've got a litigation

290
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,200
risk and you know you're going to get

291
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,560
sued

292
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,399
your lawyers say it's going to be

293
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,000
between a 6 and 8 million

294
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,079
payoff well you take that off the sale

295
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,880
price

296
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,800
and then integration costs if this is a

297
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,240
purchase that you hope to merge with

298
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,800
your existing company

299
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,519
because you want what they've got well

300
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,399
if they're

301
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,839
a pile of clues it's going to be really

302
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,200
hard to integrate that with

303
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,440
your hopefully better stuff so

304
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,760
that just is is a discount right you've

305
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,160
gone to the car dealership and you said

306
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,360
i want that car kelly blue book puts it

307
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,319
at 11 000

308
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,160
but i need new tires and i need this so

309
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,480
i'll pay you 10.

310
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,120
fine the deal's still going to happen

311
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,240
you're just paying a little less

312
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,720
then you've got deal stoppers where the

313
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,519
the people on the buy side want to say

314
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,839
wait a minute

315
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,200
we need to reconsider even making this

316
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,720
transaction

317
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,560
uh examples i've seen in this space are

318
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,800
code our core capabilities their

319
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,640
vaporware the

320
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,399
capabilities that are it's that are in

321
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,760
your marketing materials

322
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,079
don't actually work i'm sure no one has

323
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,920
ever seen that before in this space or

324
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,239
you have significant liabilities that

325
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,360
you haven't disclosed

326
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,519
or haven't even found so how do we find

327
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,600
this stuff

328
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,680
uh testing the number of times we've

329
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,800
just sent a couple pen testers at their

330
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,000
infer to go

331
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,519
find things what's wrong there right

332
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,680
take the code base and shove it through

333
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,920
some static review tool

334
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,120
um do a pen test from the outside if

335
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,920
we've got time

336
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,440
um i hate to say something nice about a

337
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,839
competitor but ncc scout suite is a

338
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,480
brilliant tool for finding out what do

339
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,720
you do wrong in your cloud intra

340
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,959
and i'm not recommending these as

341
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,480
gotchas i'm recommending if you run

342
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,040
if you run a tool against your code base

343
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,399
or your public facing infrastructure or

344
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,199
your cloud infra

345
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,959
and you're finding repeated problems

346
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,399
that gives us ideas about

347
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,199
other things the analogy i like to use

348
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,040
is

349
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,399
you go to a you go to a restaurant and

350
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,959
the bathroom's dirty

351
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,240
well i can't go into the kitchen but if

352
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,359
i if i say that you're not keeping the

353
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,560
bathroom clean

354
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,160
there probably are bigger problems and

355
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,638
since i only have a

356
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,439
a week to look at this stuff i want to

357
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,240
look where i can

358
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,560
find dirt and extrapolate that if you if

359
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,839
you didn't fix this and i can find it

360
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,880
there's other stuff hidden so what else

361
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,480
am i doing

362
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,399
are our teams doing you're doing

363
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,320
documentation reviews i want to see what

364
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,480
your architecture looks like

365
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,839
what's your bug backlog look like how

366
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,480
quickly do you clear it

367
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,880
how quickly do to identify problems

368
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,279
right

369
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,639
if you've got a small backlog but we

370
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,279
found bugs

371
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,920
means that your ability to find stuff is

372
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,240
broken

373
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,279
or lacking and i would like to question

374
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,920
why

375
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,160
um look at existing incidents did you

376
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,519
learn anything from that past incident

377
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,079
right you got popped three years ago

378
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,560
did you learn from that did you update

379
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,800
your

380
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,839
instant response you put some defenses

381
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,319
in place

382
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,000
what are you doing and that gets a

383
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,120
holistic idea of what you are as a

384
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,600
company

385
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,760
and then the final bit is we play being

386
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,160
the bobs from office space

387
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,959
i talk to your infra people i talk to

388
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,600
your devs

389
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,040
i talk to your compliance people i talk

390
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,199
to your sales people

391
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,800
i learn about your market i learn about

392
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,519
how you produce your

393
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,199
goods and services i learn how you do

394
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,000
things and i find out if you have the

395
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,800
ability to

396
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
find new risks in your environment maybe

397
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,240
you don't

398
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,279
and i get a sense of also your

399
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,079
management team

400
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,480
do these people know what they're doing

401
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,160
and

402
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,079
sometimes those are recommendations back

403
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,839
to the buyers to say

404
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,599
when we're done this is what you're

405
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,120
gonna get if that's still something

406
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,360
you're interested in

407
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,720
you know we're we're signing off on what

408
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,600
we found this is what it's going to

409
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,959
cause to fix

410
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,800
and we have some impressions so what do

411
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,680
we find

412
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,000
if the target company is as mature and

413
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,638
well

414
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,240
together as we'd expect you know

415
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,639
nobody's close to perfect and that's

416
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,680
okay

417
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,720
i don't expect to find really really

418
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,439
mature

419
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,480
aspects in a 50 person company that's

420
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,639
three years old

421
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,519
right there are gonna things you're

422
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,600
missing

423
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,199
that's fine that's expected i might

424
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
still recommend that they fix that and

425
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,959
that's

426
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,839
offsets your cost but i'm not horrified

427
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:13,680
if you're a 5000 person shop

428
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,040
in a regulated environment and you're

429
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,040
missing core things

430
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,839
that's another category but i'm really

431
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,079
curious about

432
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,240
do you does this make sense did you know

433
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,079
what you were doing

434
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,320
if there's a problem sometimes i've

435
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,359
walked into places and i see like

436
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,800
things you should have aren't there that

437
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,959
makes us dig further because

438
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,120
why didn't you think of doing that

439
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,800
where's why don't why don't you have a

440
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,800
sim why can't you do a learning

441
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,479
sometimes i've seen tons of tech debt

442
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,758
there is nothing like finding out your

443
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,240
core application runs in cold fusion

444
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:53,120
and i think wow you know you you'd hire

445
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,600
more devs but they're all dead

446
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,199
um potential breaches is there something

447
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,480
that says

448
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,639
you are so incapable of finding an event

449
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,519
that someone could have popped you taken

450
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,959
what they wanted

451
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:10,399
and left and just gone

452
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,880
right are they still there but you have

453
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,800
no

454
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,000
ability to detect it unless something

455
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,319
goes down

456
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,320
or until visa calls you up and says

457
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,120
we're seeing a lot of fraud by people

458
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,120
who used

459
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,040
your store and then sometimes there's

460
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,120
really big problems that that want us to

461
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,759
make you question the deal entirely you

462
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,759
know the

463
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,959
that you only move the headstones you

464
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,959
didn't move the bodies

465
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:40,160
so arguing over findings that's the next

466
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,600
step once we find everything

467
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,240
we want to go and identify to write them

468
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,959
up in a coherent

469
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,279
doc and go back to everyone involved and

470
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,279
say

471
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,320
this is what we found this is what we

472
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,199
think you should do

473
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,800
this is what it's going to cost to fix

474
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,040
handle appropriately

475
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,758
right how much they're going to cost to

476
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,680
fix what's the impact if you don't

477
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,760
how would we order them how would we

478
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,879
prioritize these things because we know

479
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,559
that you're probably not going to

480
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,160
immediately fix everything

481
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,839
you're going to fix what you have to do

482
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,679
and continue on in the business

483
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,119
discussing with the deal team right

484
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,839
we're going to answer questions

485
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,599
so they understand what it is is wrong

486
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,918
with the company we're buying

487
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,799
or they're buying really and then post

488
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,000
sale

489
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,960
um often usually afterwards the

490
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,480
the purchase occurs and the new

491
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,919
acquisition is saying

492
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,919
how do we fix the problems you

493
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,760
identified and we'll try to give them

494
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,760
some useful advice and keep on going

495
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,280
so i realize that none of this ever

496
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,280
makes sense unless you do it as

497
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,799
hypotheticals

498
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:51,760
so we have a

499
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,720
client uh our the target is a online

500
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,760
lifestyle

501
00:17:52,720 --> 00:18:00,400
fashion seller so they sell uh

502
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:03,760
jewelry accessories clothing um

503
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,799
high-end hippie-esque um

504
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,720
expensive i've got a very strong social

505
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,559
media presence

506
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,160
they're on the ground they've got

507
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,639
influencers

508
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,640
a lot of really lush pictures of of

509
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,160
people enjoying themselves

510
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,240
outside um very political

511
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,360
social bent they're they're pushing a

512
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,520
lifestyle

513
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,559
good for them they've got a very premium

514
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,520
sales model

515
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,918
uh high touch high margin they know your

516
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,080
name

517
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,559
when you call they would really like you

518
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,039
to remain a customer of theirs

519
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,480
that's the company we go and they've we

520
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,200
we go and take a look at them and

521
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,840
their sales organization is great their

522
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,640
intra

523
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,639
is a mess it's amateur hour

524
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,520
they're doing everything wrong with pci

525
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,880
everything's in one database

526
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,720
that's world accessible or at least not

527
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,640
you know not all the rules you're

528
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,320
suspecting to see out of the pci you

529
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,559
know pci sac d

530
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,600
they're holding credit card numbers in

531
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,360
plain text

532
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,918
like all the things that make everyone

533
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,080
in our industry cringe

534
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,640
and there is what i like to think of as

535
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,840
a high delta between the truth

536
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,640
and reality here they're doing a lot of

537
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,799
things wrong

538
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,400
but they're all the documentation

539
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,520
they're kicking to their credit card

540
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,440
processors

541
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:29,760
is everything's fine please go away

542
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,760
so what do we do

543
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,439
what could they have done better before

544
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,200
we showed up because we took a fair

545
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,440
amount of money off the table for that

546
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,280
sale

547
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,360
do a quick look around do a pre-audit

548
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,840
audit hire somebody

549
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,199
bring somebody in who isn't you just to

550
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,840
say

551
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,320
what would you fix here that's usually a

552
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,799
cheap

553
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,120
consulting engagement less than you know

554
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,720
less than ten thousand dollars

555
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,959
um if you have documentation you needed

556
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,480
do it now before you're really in the

557
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,200
market because there's nothing like

558
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,960
seeing

559
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,240
documentation that was done literally

560
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,600
the night before

561
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,440
everybody knows that the time to do

562
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,559
homework is on the bus on the way to

563
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,080
school

564
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:14,720
not here do the cheap stuff

565
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,399
right run your patch just make sure your

566
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,799
systems are up to date

567
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,679
make sure basic scans are fine fine

568
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,559
stuff like

569
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,880
run nmap against your external network

570
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,879
um

571
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,760
right you know stuff stuff your code

572
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,360
through a static analyzer and fix

573
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,760
something

574
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,520
because everything we can ding you on is

575
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,320
price taken off and we're going to

576
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,840
bump up that cost because we're trying

577
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,600
to find as much money to take off the

578
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,600
table to justify our existence

579
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,520
show improvement show that you as an

580
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,320
organization can

581
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,240
find and fix your own things and that it

582
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,600
doesn't take the fear of an audit

583
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:59,039
or an assessment our due diligence

584
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:02,320
to force you to clean these things up

585
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,760
right so put your stuff in a backlog and

586
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,960
then show that you're cleaning up the

587
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,320
backlog

588
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,679
make it seem like you're more of an

589
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,678
adult than you actually are

590
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,400
so second hypothetical is an actual deal

591
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,559
stopper

592
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,919
target companies and advertising

593
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,000
technology

594
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:23,280
um they're a small eastern european shop

595
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,200
that does

596
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,399
some kind of we do better big data

597
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,919
against

598
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,559
what we you know against the cookies

599
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:35,760
we've sucked off of your browser

600
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:39,039
some magic some you know hand waving but

601
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,240
they can they claim that they can

602
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:44,879
more effectively go from

603
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,320
view to add to purchase than anyone else

604
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,159
can

605
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,080
the buyer's very interested in this

606
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,159
capability they have been in

607
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,918
marketing since direct mail they're

608
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,440
still in direct mail but they also have

609
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,880
an effect of online

610
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,720
they've already got a bunch of data

611
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,320
scientists doing this work

612
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,360
but they really like this little

613
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,559
company's technology

614
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,959
most of their clients are in the eu

615
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,639
or japan or canada where we actually

616
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,960
care about privacy

617
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,120
so they're that's a that's sort of the

618
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,880
asterisk around their concerns

619
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,678
is this other little company doing

620
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,799
anything that's scary

621
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,799
and well yes every question we give them

622
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,080
means more questions they're based in

623
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,960
eastern europe but their internal

624
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,559
policies

625
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,440
are all in english which is a clear red

626
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,360
flag like

627
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,919
no one puts your internal notes in a

628
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,678
language you don't speak

629
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,200
nothing they describe actually happens

630
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,640
they handed us a

631
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:46,240
hardening guidelines for windows

632
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:49,039
as they're hardening hardening

633
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,720
proof that they hardened systems and we

634
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,520
then asked and they had no windows

635
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,520
systems

636
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,120
so like you have documentation that has

637
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,400
nothing to do with you

638
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,719
you know it's it's like if you went

639
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,280
through for you know i i need proof that

640
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,120
you own

641
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,960
things you went through the all the old

642
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,918
manuals in the back of your filing

643
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,559
cabinet for like

644
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,640
old pieces of technology that you bought

645
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,080
you've not thrown away and handed it to

646
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,559
people like

647
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,320
huh i didn't realize you still had this

648
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,320
stove oh that's two stoves ago

649
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,520
so everything about them felt wrong

650
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,720
and then we asked some more questions

651
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,918
and find out that they're

652
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,320
storing everything they get

653
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,360
they are violating gdpr they're

654
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,039
violating

655
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,039
a canadian privacy act

656
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,240
this is a risk back to our buyer

657
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,600
and we realize like look if if you buy

658
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,520
them

659
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:51,279
under the gdpr it's now two percent of

660
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,559
your revenue not theirs so you have a

661
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,640
problem

662
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,320
and we then talking to them when they

663
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,880
when they said well really not

664
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,480
interested in their existing customers

665
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,240
what we are interested in just this

666
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,480
technology and we came up with

667
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,919
an idea of like don't buy them just

668
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,080
license the technology

669
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,120
buy the license to the stuff that

670
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,760
they're doing

671
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,279
hire some devs away and like make it

672
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,600
very clear that you're doing that so

673
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,080
you're paying that company enough money

674
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,199
that they don't come around and do

675
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,039
anything about it

676
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,240
and that way you get what you actually

677
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,080
