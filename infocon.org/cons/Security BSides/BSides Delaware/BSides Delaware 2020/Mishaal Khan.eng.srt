00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,559
good morning

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,679
good evening or good afternoon i am

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,799
michelle khan

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,960
and today i'll be talking about

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:20,080
breaking mfa a little bit about myself

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,560
before i get started

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,359
i wear many hats i'm kind of a jack of

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,240
all trades

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,439
and master a few i'm the cyber security

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,839
practice lead

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:35,040
at a company as well as a virtual cso

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,680
i'm a chief i'm an ethical hacker

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,480
i've been doing pen testing for a while

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,120
ccie

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,879
certified social engineer i do osun

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,038
investigations on the side

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,399
privacy advisor kind of goes hand in

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,440
hand

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,680
have a lot of multinational experience

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,879
from small to large organizations

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,600
education hospitality you name it

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,320
pretty much every sector needs it but

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,840
today

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:07,360
i'll be going over some of the myths

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,200
around mfa what is mfa

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,560
some of the important hacks that have

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,479
happened

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,479
around this technology two-factor

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,799
authentication multi-factor

31
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,000
uh some mitigation steps i'll be going

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,759
over

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,759
some of the options that are there

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,720
around vendor technology

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,000
i'll demo some of those things some

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,119
things you should consider

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,040
as an individual and as an organization

38
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,360
when you adopt multi-factor

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,920
authentication as a technology

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,960
and some best practices and obviously

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,000
costs related

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,600
to it as well but by and large

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,159
i'm gonna be showing you some really

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,360
cool demos

45
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,119
now we start this conversation with

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,039
with the firewall itself um

47
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,720
i consult a lot of organizations and

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,799
their first answer

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,399
for to security is hey we have a

50
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,799
firewall we're secure

51
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,159
my answer is always look at all these

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,880
threats that are out there

53
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,600
a firewall does not see these things

54
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,600
stuff like

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,000
fishing you know malware unless your

56
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,760
firewall has advanced malware protection

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,720
and stuff like that

58
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,280
but but ransomware communicates outside

59
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,680
uh to its command and control

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,520
uh account compromise someone has your

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,080
username password

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,800
doesn't matter what firewalls you have

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,160
or what

64
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,840
defenses you have within your

65
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,640
organization

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,840
social engineering is probably the top

67
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,879
way people get in

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,959
phishing wishing impersonations

69
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,959
it could be human error with default

70
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,840
ports or credentials

71
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,840
or unpatched vulnerabilities or we've

72
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,160
seen in the past breaches happen because

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,959
of

74
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,319
insecure cloud configurations aws

75
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,840
buckets open

76
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,480
so there's a whole bunch of things that

77
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,040
happen within security

78
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,200
we need to protect ourselves by taking a

79
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,400
layered approach to this

80
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,720
the more layers we have the more

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,599
secure we are and the harder it is for

82
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,280
the bad guys to breach us

83
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,040
one of these layers which we'll be

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,599
talking about today and a very

85
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,239
important layer is multi-factor

86
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,280
authentication

87
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,640
why mfa you know passwords are broken

88
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,000
they're not good enough it's a couple of

89
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,720
decades old technology it

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,120
when you have mfa enabled it requires

91
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,879
more

92
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,959
effort to be breached it's not

93
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,560
impossible you know i'll show you that

94
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,400
today a couple of examples

95
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,799
uh but it's also very easy to implement

96
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,120
there's no excuse not to have mfa

97
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,959
if the option is there and you're

98
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,280
getting instant results it's not like a

99
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,519
firewall configuration or some

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,040
you know email filtering spam filter

101
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,640
setup those take

102
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,959
days those take weeks sometimes to set

103
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,000
up

104
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,680
expertise dollar amount but with mfa

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,239
it's it's so easy it's almost a

106
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,239
no-brainer

107
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,480
here's an example of uh when mfa could

108
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,040
have been useful

109
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,079
the twitter accounts of a lot of these

110
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,200
nfl teams

111
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,439
were hacked and it was so

112
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,439
easy to hack that some say you know it

113
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,439
was primarily because of mfa

114
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,918
we don't know the exact details but if

115
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,719
mfa was enabled on these accounts

116
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,479
it would have made this hack so much

117
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,280
more difficult

118
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,479
but let's listen to that i want to show

119
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,960
you some

120
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,639
demos let's let's clear out the concept

121
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,560
between

122
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:38,160
2fa versus mfa before we go any deeper

123
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,960
just to set the stage so the multiple

124
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,880
factors

125
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,080
you know so the first factor is your

126
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,759
password that's

127
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,359
one faa call it or sometimes that's your

128
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,520
pin

129
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,080
or a certain security question to get in

130
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,799
but primarily 99.9 percent of the time

131
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,680
your password is your first factor your

132
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,320
second factor

133
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,000
is usually that token that comes on your

134
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,719
phone or that sms

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,360
and that's there or some providers will

136
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,560
send you an

137
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,039
email with that code uh a yubikey

138
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,880
a hardware token badge all those things

139
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,639
that's your second factor so something

140
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,320
you know your password versus something

141
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,560
you physically possess

142
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,320
makes it harder for anyone else to

143
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,280
breach both

144
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,919
to add to this you can add a third

145
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,080
factor

146
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,440
something that's inherent to you like

147
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,560
your fingerprints your facial

148
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,600
recognition your

149
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:34,000
iris and those type of things so

150
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,080
a practical example of 3fa or mfa

151
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,120
is you log in with your with your

152
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,719
password

153
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,759
you you get an sms on your phone

154
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,800
but to view that sms you need to unlock

155
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,720
your phone

156
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,560
using your fingerprint or facial

157
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,960
recognition whatever your phone supports

158
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,560
so now you're using all three and that's

159
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,239
multi-factor authentication

160
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,240
these terms are interchanged every now

161
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,280
and then you know i may

162
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,400
use them back and forth as well but

163
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,799
officially these are the definitions now

164
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,359
there's

165
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,319
many types of mfa so before we break

166
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,440
into something

167
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:12,160
we got to know what options there are

168
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,479
and i've listed some of the common types

169
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
of

170
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,240
multi-factor authentication here in

171
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,160
order of least secure

172
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,960
to most secure least secure sms's why

173
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,720
because

174
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,280
you know there's sim swapping attacks

175
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,400
out there emails your email can get

176
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,520
breached as well

177
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,359
or be diverted then

178
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,359
more stronger options are hardware

179
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,479
tokens or apps or

180
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,560
something that plugs into a usb

181
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,520
the strongest one is biometrics because

182
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,759
you possess

183
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,840
those not saying none of these can be

184
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,360
breached all of these can be breached

185
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,400
but why make it easier use the strongest

186
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,560
methods

187
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,799
at your disposal some of the

188
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,479
key facts and myths uh you know we talk

189
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,479
about mfa it's very secure

190
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,080
yes everyone should be implementing it

191
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,440
it's a no-brainer

192
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,280
stuart but know that almost half of the

193
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,400
cybersecurity breaches

194
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,880
are not preventable by strong mfa these

195
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,239
are

196
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:16,159
statistics i know before and

197
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:19,360
i will the next slide shows you why

198
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,599
so here are some of the common methods

199
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,720
that you can bypass multi-factor

200
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,039
authentication

201
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,960
you know through social engineering

202
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,680
asking the person for the code

203
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,799
it may seem simple but i'll demo it in a

204
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,880
bit

205
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,039
if you have physical access to their

206
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,880
devices to their phones then

207
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:41,199
game over fishing websites do that

208
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,199
and they fish for credentials i'm going

209
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:48,720
to show you how i can fish for

210
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,319
more than just credentials sim swapping

211
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,360
we've heard about that on the phone a

212
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,160
lot where somebody calls your isp

213
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,840
pretends it's you gives them your

214
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,639
details and says hey i bought

215
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,960
new phone here's the imei number of that

216
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,840
new device could you swap over

217
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,400
my previous number to this new device

218
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,080
and now

219
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,758
you own that number through social

220
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,758
engineering and now you reset the

221
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,039
password you get the sms code instead of

222
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,800
the original person

223
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:20,719
that's sim swapping trojans or malware

224
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,360
install can bypass that as well

225
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,160
but today i'm gonna show you session

226
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,960
tokens

227
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,560
in fact session cookies is what i'll be

228
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,799
stealing today

229
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,039
one of the more advanced techniques yet

230
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,479
it's quite simple to perform

231
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:40,000
when you see it account recovery smss

232
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:44,159
sometimes can be one configured

233
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,640
wrong you can bypass those as well

234
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,760
there's a bunch of other ways but let's

235
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,399
get into the

236
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:55,839
simpler ones first so hacking rsa tokens

237
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,880
what's an rsa token let's look at

238
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,000
an example of that so google will show

239
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,959
you

240
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,920
this is what an rsa token is this was

241
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,399
pretty popular

242
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,279
back in the days it's it's not so common

243
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,440
anymore

244
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,320
it's a six digit rolling code on this

245
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,399
device

246
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,320
this is that second factor something you

247
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,880
possess so the whole point

248
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,519
of an rsa token or an rsa key is

249
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,560
that one person possesses this at any

250
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,800
given time

251
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,760
um and you obviously can't share this

252
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,040
well not when you're dealing with uh

253
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,319
humans

254
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,760
you can bypass this so this is this was

255
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,920
taken from

256
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:43,200
showdown i believe a picture of a

257
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,479
live webcam stream showing the six-digit

258
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,959
rolling codes required for 2fa you can

259
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,640
read

260
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,319
some of the codes on the on the bottom

261
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,640
one this is when you want to share it

262
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,920
amongst people so

263
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,000
sometimes you got to think outside the

264
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,680
box and if you get

265
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,080
access to the stream which in this case

266
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,959
was open you have access to those

267
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,720
rolling codes or that second factor so

268
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,359
this is the first hacking technique you

269
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,600
must be saying

270
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,200
this is not hacking this is all this is

271
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,560
ocean or

272
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,560
just thinking outside the box

273
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:19,920
but before i show you the very next demo

274
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,880
let me show you the difference of the

275
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,000
the two different types of um codes that

276
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,959
you can receive

277
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,920
totp that's the time based one-time

278
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,239
password

279
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,719
versus push notifications so

280
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,120
let me give you a live example of what

281
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,880
these are

282
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,720
let me just refresh this page so if you

283
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,920
go to demo.duo.com

284
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,360
it was a popular vendor for

285
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,399
multi-factor authentication on this demo

286
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,640
you can see let me

287
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,800
try to make this a little bigger so you

288
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,000
log in with your email and password

289
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,760
that's your first factor you click sign

290
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
in and you get the option where do you

291
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,839
want

292
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,440
that second code let's do passcode

293
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,040
the most common option this could be

294
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,880
google authenticator

295
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,399
you bring up your phone here on the

296
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,760
right

297
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,839
you unlock it click on it and

298
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,079
you get that six digit code that that

299
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,640
changes every 30 seconds or so

300
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,719
you take that code you put it in here

301
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,360
and you press login

302
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,680
that's the most common way of doing

303
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,079
multi-factor authentication

304
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,079
now there's something called push

305
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,199
notifications as well

306
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:39,120
and let's uh

307
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:42,399
let's demo our first hacking technique

308
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,560
social engineering so let's

309
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,240
start with one assumption here i have

310
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,359
your password

311
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,360
how i got it by a phishing attack

312
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,839
or because you use the same password

313
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,399
everywhere i got it from a data breach

314
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,000
getting your password is not difficult

315
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,160
nowadays

316
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,440
but getting that second factor is so

317
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,560
next

318
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,200
i spoof my phone number to let's say

319
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,839
your id

320
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:12,079
department and place a call

321
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,560
now uh i s i set this up in the back end

322
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,399
so i know your username and password so

323
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,439
i enter your username and password in

324
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,880
the field

325
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,120
and before pressing sign in i call you

326
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,320
and now the phone call can go something

327
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,560
like this that

328
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,240
hey this is joe from help desk we reset

329
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,479
your multi-factor authentication token

330
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,360
to enable 256-bit encryption for better

331
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,600
security

332
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,240
can you please confirm it still works by

333
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:40,560
clicking on the prompt on your phone

334
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,399
right about now

335
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,479
they get this prompt they're like uh

336
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,680
okay they click on it

337
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:52,720
and it says approve or deny they press

338
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:55,439
approve and you're in thank you for

339
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,519
staying safe and have a great day and i

340
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,720
put the phone down

341
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,839
so social engineering is extremely easy

342
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,959
if done right

343
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,880
right circumstances write pretext the

344
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,560
right amount of ocean

345
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,920
and then you place a call like this i

346
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,959
made it sound easy

347
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,040
it actually is easy i've done this

348
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,239
to a few companies all you need is one

349
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,839
hit you know

350
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,000
don't forget you you may fail a few

351
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,839
times but when you have a company

352
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
of a couple of hundred or thousand

353
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,760
people all you need is one person to

354
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,040
fall for this

355
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,720
and this is a very powerful technique

356
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:36,319
the second technique uh requires

357
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:39,600
a little bit of setup a back-end setup

358
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,800
so this involves phishing and then a

359
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,760
man-in-the-middle attack

360
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,279
which is a proxy server and then

361
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,040
stealing session cookies

362
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,560
all of this may sound a little

363
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,480
complicated but let me show you

364
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:55,439
in real time how i would do this

365
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,839
so i've set all this up let me go to my

366
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:02,639
cali box

367
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:05,760
and let me just sign in here

368
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,760
my wrong password

369
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,160
all right so i'm in my kali linux

370
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,959
machine here

371
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,160
i have google cloud uh running i have a

372
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,959
server running here called

373
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,439
evil gen 2 and let me show you what that

374
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,079
is

375
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,720
so there's a tool out there called evil

376
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,638
gen x

377
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,560
or at least that's how i believe it's

378
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,560
pronounced

379
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,119
it's on github this is the proxy server

380
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,638
and the entire tutorial is here if you

381
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,920
want to know how to set that up

382
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,560
so this is my proxy server my phishing

383
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,800
framework

384
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:44,880
is is gofish and

385
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,279
here is my email that i'm logged into

386
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,000
this is a sock puppet account an alias

387
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,320
account

388
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,440
which i'm going to be using for this

389
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,000
demo

390
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,519
so i just got this email it says and

391
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,959
this is the phishing email so it starts

392
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,279
with phishing

393
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,079
here's an email that uh so let's look at

394
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,079
the

395
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,560
the from address it says microsoft at

396
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:06,800
verification.com

397
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,160
that verification has a spelling mistake

398
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,719
in it there's no eye

399
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,719
towards the end so this is the phishing

400
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,519
attack that i've sent

401
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,839
um it says you know we've removed access

402
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,000
to your onedrive temporarily

403
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,040
go to onedrive here so typical asking

404
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,800
you for

405
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,120
to take an action to click on something

406
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,000
when i hover over this link

407
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,279
now it's tiny on the lower left side you

408
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,240
can see that the link

409
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,199
goes to some other website kind of looks

410
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,079
legit but it's not

411
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,758
legit but before i click on this let's

412
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,959
go back to the back end so this is what

413
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,720
the hacker sees

414
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,040
i've purposely kept these two things

415
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,519
separate and not on the same

416
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,680
operating system so you see that they're

417
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,120
completely segregated

418
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,160
so i'm running this server on the on

419
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:58,399
google cloud here's that server

420
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:01,920
let me reconnect the session timed out

421
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,560
so this server is running evil gen x

422
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,639
and this is the brow of the hacker's

423
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,119
machine here

424
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,880
the hacker's machine has internet access

425
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,600
and everything

426
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,480
so i'm i'm kind of set up here trying to

427
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,839
see

428
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:22,480
um trying to log into that guy's device

429
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:27,199
so let this back-end server refresh

430
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:31,120
and give it a few seconds

431
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:34,160
connecting and there we go

432
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,839
so this is that server running let's go

433
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,719
back

434
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:41,519
and restart this

435
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,959
so now evil gen x is running and it took

436
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,920
a couple of hours to set this up

437
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,920
now that i'm set up

438
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,079
now i sit here and wait for someone to

439
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,719
click so let's click and see what

440
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,239
happens

441
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,959
so i click on this link here

442
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,240
it opens in another window and it asks

443
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,959
me to sign in

444
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,720
now you see the url bar there that's not

445
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,678
really microsoft that's

446
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,799
e e-authenticated.com that's a domain

447
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,000
that i own

448
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,400
but hopefully most people won't notice

449
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,559
this

450
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,120
now i'm going to log in here so i have

451
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,039
the credentials of this person

452
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,599
sitting right here let's take the

453
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:23,199
username

454
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:25,520
put that in and then password

455
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,679
so i'm using bitwarden as the password

456
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:32,080
manager

457
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:35,919
and i have a really long password here

458
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,639
i sign in and now it should ask me for

459
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,000
this the second factor the the code

460
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,559
let's go back and see what the hacker

461
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,160
sees

462
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:47,280
so the hacker is seeing down here

463
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,160
my password really long password here

464
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,799
i see the username was input so i got

465
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,520
both of

466
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,639
those things but i won't be able to get

467
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,120
in with just this

468
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,120
because mfa is enabled now let's enter

469
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,760
this code

470
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:05,600
the code is this rolling code here 17

471
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:08,160
seconds left so let me copy this code

472
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,520
put the code in here and don't want to

473
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:15,760
remember this device but let's verify

474
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:19,280
and i'm i as the user have logged in

475
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,520
to my onedrive whatever let's go back to

476
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,320
the hacker the more interesting part

477
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,160
on the hacker side it says authorization

478
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,280
tokens intercepted

479
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,000
and my job is done so

480
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,840
let's look at what i really got what did

481
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,039
i capture besides the username and

482
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,399
password

483
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:41,200
so i go under sessions and

484
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,520
i see this is what i got so for those of

485
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,720
you

486
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,120
curious to know what a cookie looks like

487
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,480
this is what a cookie looks like so i

488
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,799
stole

489
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,440
the the session cookie so let's copy

490
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,440
this cookie

491
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,918
now how do i log in if i use the

492
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,320
username and password to log in

493
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,679
i'm not going anywhere i don't have that

494
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,520
rolling code

495
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:08,880
so let's go here let's let's sign into

496
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,879
outlook on the hacker side

497
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,640
outlook.live.com and i'm asked to sign

498
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,720
in

499
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,280
but i'm not going to sign in i have

500
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,559
something better here i have the cookie

501
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,918
so let me first remove

502
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,000
all the spaces from the cookie it's

503
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,559
going to give me an error so i have this

504
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,480
tool here i paste in the cookie it

505
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,600
removes all the white spaces

506
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:37,039
and let me copy that cookie okay

507
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,600
going back to this screen here i can't

508
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,879
log in i refresh it ask me for a

509
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,600
username password

510
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,960
i have a plugin here called edit this

511
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,918
cookie

512
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,120
i import the cookie that i just captured

513
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,799
here's that cookie

514
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:56,080
and i press ok import

515
00:19:52,799 --> 00:20:00,480
now same screen here nothing has changed

516
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:05,280
i go back to outlook.live.com

517
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,280
press enter and fingers crossed

518
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,840
i am in i'm in that user's account

519
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:14,320
i did not need his username or password

520
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,879
just to see if i'm really in let's go

521
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,439
through some of the emails

522
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,480
yep that was the email that the user

523
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,520
clicked on

524
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,320
still loading this is that email the

525
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,960
phishing email

526
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,600
so i'm in from a user's perspective the

527
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,400
user's

528
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,639
still also in they don't know anything

529
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,799
has happened

530
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,559
simple as that sure it required a couple

531
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,120
of hours of setup but

532
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,559
you see how dangerous this technique is

533
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,080
with just

534
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,760
stealing a cookie and this session

535
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,360
can be up indefinitely i can keep

536
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,520
refreshing the page and

537
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,360
the user would never know that i'm in

538
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,840
their account

539
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,280
an advanced technique but if you know

540
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,760
how to make it work

541
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,760
it works

542
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,959
mitigation how do i stop myself from

543
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,639
doing something like this or a hacker

544
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,520
from getting in

545
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,080
well firewall is not the answer to that

546
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,879
but

547
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,399
some of these mfa techniques have ai

548
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,840
based or anomaly based

549
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,400
solutions which means if something's

550
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,840
fishy so for example right now if i look

551
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,280
at my

552
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,240
activity in my outlook account it'll

553
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,600
show

554
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,480
two people have logged in so if

555
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,320
the mfa provider like duo in this case

556
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,200
they have something on an anomaly based

557
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,360
solutions where they can tell that hey

558
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,840
you've logged in from a different state

559
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,760
a different ip address different country

560
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,959
i'm not going to let you go through so

561
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,679
you can block

562
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,159
geo block different countries and say

563
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,480
hey if a login attempt comes from china

564
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,400
yeah hotmail is going to let let the

565
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,120
username and password go through

566
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,000
but the mfa is not you'll never get that

567
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,039
second factor

568
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,200
because it it's being originated from

569
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:07,120
a banned country within your dashboard

570
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,880
there are single sign-on solutions out

571
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,039
there which make

572
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,360
life a little bit easier

573
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,000
enterprise-grade solutions

574
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,840
test it pen test your solutions if you

575
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,720
think you've hardened your security well

576
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,280
enough

577
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,000
hire a pen tester and make sure there's

578
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,158
no holes

579
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,320
left there and they'll discover a few

580
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,360
then patch them

581
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,399
user awareness training is probably

582
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,120
number one here it should be if a user

583
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,080
is aware

584
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,239
of these techniques they are less likely

585
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,480
to fall for them

586
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,919
privacy is the other thing if i didn't

587
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,760
have the username

588
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:48,080
to phish or the phone number to wish

589
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,760
this attack would not have gone much

590
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,439
further people advertise their phone

591
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,640
numbers their personal cell numbers

592
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,120
on their email signatures don't do that

593
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,480
only advertise the corporate phone

594
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,360
number and let it forward to your

595
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,120
personal

596
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,959
um you know some things you can't hide

597
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,399
but the things that you can

598
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,720
you know try to be a little bit more

599
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,240
private try to be harder to find

600
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:13,760
from a personal perspective and

601
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,480
you will thwart some of these attacks

602
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,240
zero trust that's a buzzword i don't

603
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,679
know how that got in this slide sorry

604
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,120
about that

605
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,640
culture if you create that security

606
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,600
culture in your environment

607
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,960
again you are less likely to fall for

608
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,280
these type of scams

609
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,039
if a phone call like that came to your

610
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,799
organization and you have that security

611
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,640
culture in place through training and

612
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,039
through tools and stuff

613
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,799
you you're likely to say okay let me

614
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,720
call you back before i take any action

615
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,120
let me call my i.t department and

616
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,400
put the phone down and you call back

617
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,360
these things come from

618
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,360
awareness and culture

619
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:56,000
but how effective is mfa

620
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:58,960
um this is a this is a chart from

621
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
from google and just look at the yellow

622
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,600
pieces here

623
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,320
let's look at you know sms codes so

624
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,639
the yellow bars here are the targeted

625
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,918
attacks if you were a target

626
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,960
of an attack like this and you used sms

627
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,360
as your code

628
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,000
you know the account takeover prevention

629
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,120
rates are

630
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,840
76 device from 90

631
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,559
if you're using a security key 100

632
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,199
protection

633
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,918
according to this survey and i'll show

634
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,520
you why

635
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,600
this works but the least efficient are

636
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,639
location based because the hacker can

637
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,000
use vpns

638
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,320
change their originating ip address

639
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,520
phone numbers you have a 50 50 chance of

640
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,720
getting breached

641
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,120
if you use a phone number as your second

642
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,640
authentication so some are weak based on

643
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,918
stats some are strong

644
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,919
that's the only point here

645
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:57,360
there's plenty of options on the table

646
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,760
all these vendors exist and there's many

647
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,760
more

648
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:05,120
this is just the tip of the iceberg

649
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,960
which ones to choose there's there's

650
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,320
plenty of differences between all of

651
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,440
these some are free

652
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,320
some are paid solutions some have basic

653
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,760
features

654
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:19,039
others advanced let's let's look at

655
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,520
some of the basic technology by no means

656
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,600
am i gonna describe what this technology

657
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,960
is i probably don't know half of

658
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,199
uh the inner or functions of how these

659
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,960
work but the most popular ones are you

660
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,840
know the one-time passwords that i

661
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,760
showed you

662
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,120
um or actually the time based one-time

663
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,360
password which was

664
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,120
this thing here it's a rolling code this

665
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,600
can be on your phone

666
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,799
on your desktop this is by far the most

667
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,080
popular

668
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,840
method on your phone if that's your

669
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,760
second factor

670
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,600
so that's based on time it can be based

671
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,879
on other factors

672
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,959
hashes and stuff but make sure you're

673
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,200
using the latest technology like fido

674
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,240
502 or web authentication

675
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,840
um those things uh really help

676
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:08,559
and a demo on this so hardware tokens

677
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,439
this was the most powerful method and

678
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,080
this is

679
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,559
one way that you could have thwarted the

680
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:18,080
attack i did before the proxy attack

681
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,080
and i'll show you how

682
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:25,279
so let's go back to let's let me show

683
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,840
you a live example

684
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,440
let me log into my twitter it has

685
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,279
two-factor authentication and i'm going

686
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,039
to use a yubikey to get in

687
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,480
and a yubikey is um this device so i

688
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,960
have one of these devices

689
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,760
a usbc device that i'm going to use to

690
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,440
log in

691
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,600
and i want to show you how quick and

692
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,880
easy it is so

693
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:50,879
i log in using my password manager

694
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:54,000
and i it auto populates my

695
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,720
70 character password here i press

696
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,120
login and it asks me a little pop-up

697
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,200
comes

698
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,120
that this is it's it wants me to touch

699
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,039
my yubikey there's a little metal stripe

700
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,320
on it let me go ahead and touch it

701
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:10,960
there i touched it and i've logged in

702
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,960
that's how simple and quick it was

703
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,600
so google capture probably because i'm

704
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,480
on a vpn

705
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,879
so i basically logged in with just a

706
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,880
touch of a button

707
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,480
i don't know why i'm doing this but yeah

708
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,520
so that's how quick and easy

709
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,520
hardware tokens are

710
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,320
things to look for when you're looking

711
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,480
for the right vendor

712
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,520
there's many considerations here push

713
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,000
notifications

714
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,600
not everyone has those uh the basic

715
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,679
google authenticator it's just

716
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,600
rolling codes you gotta manually put

717
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,880
those in or copy paste those in

718
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,520
but other vendors like duo

719
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,559
or microsoft or a whole bunch of others

720
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,879
you saw on that list

721
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,639
have something called push notifications

722
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,840
literally accept or deny

723
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,559
it makes the user adoption much easier

724
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,000
make sure you have backup calls or means

725
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,279
to backup that entire

726
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,399
two-factor authentication system

727
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:10,960
do you have online access or

728
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,399
is does that mfa only work when you're

729
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,080
connected online

730
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,840
i've had this issue with customers where

731
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,760
they're like hey we're in a secure

732
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,799
bunker or whatever or underground where

733
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:24,240
there's no wi-fi or there's no

734
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:27,039
lte signal and we need mfa there well

735
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,039
hardware tokens ubikeys are the way to

736
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,559
go there

737
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,960
open source uh is is the tool

738
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,600
open source or is it proprietary has it

739
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,880
been

740
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,039
audited uh you know is is it being

741
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,559
checked for feature updates and bugs all

742
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,600
those kind of things that's important to

743
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,440
know as well

744
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,360
features like geolocation would block

745
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,080
some of those attacks

746
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,879
how easy is it for the user to enroll

747
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,639
themselves

748
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,240
or does the admin have to enroll

749
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,279
thousands of users

750
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,039
it kind of gets in the way endpoint

751
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:02,080
security some of these

752
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:05,520
features uh are embedded like with the

753
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,399
the duo app if my uh device

754
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,000
has is not updated to the latest ios it

755
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,879
will be like hey guess what you're not

756
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,200
allowed to log

757
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,159
in with that second factor until you

758
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,039
upgrade your

759
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,000
iphone or android or whatever because

760
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,480
the

761
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,600
admin has set this policy so there's

762
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:27,039
endpoint security built in there as well

763
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:30,320
there's integration with multiple apps

764
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:32,000
that can help there's different prices

765
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,120
all over the board from free to

766
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,760
expensive

767
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,840
and we'll get to that in a bit there's

768
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,559
device health health and

769
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,480
multi-device syncing and stuff like that

770
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,879
so all these are good considerations to

771
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,039
think about when choosing a vendor

772
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,480
for your organization because you can't

773
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,840
hop around you you got to make that

774
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,640
decision once and

775
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,639
kind of stick with it

776
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,399
so adoption is key we talk about all

777
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,840
this technology

778
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:02,080
if no one's implementing it then uh

779
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,120
what's the use uh so eighty percent of

780
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,918
breaches are still

781
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,799
linked to passwords so we gotta still

782
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,840
protect those

783
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,320
uh things and a multi-pronged approach

784
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,039
here

785
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,480
is your your your best defense single

786
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:18,158
sign-on mfa

787
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,120
password manager you saw how i logged

788
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,520
into twitter

789
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,320
that's that's the route most people

790
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,960
should take

791
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,120
password managers you shouldn't be uh

792
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,039
remembering your passwords my password

793
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,918
for twitter was 70 characters and that's

794
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,640
the average

795
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,360
i i get for most websites whatever their

796
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,799
max is

797
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,240
i try to max it out

798
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,080
you've got to protect yourself in many

799
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,279
ways otherwise

800
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,360
you're not going to adopt technology

801
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,360
these are stats from one of the most

802
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,080
popular password managers out there

803
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,559
lastpass and before we get into the

804
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,360
stats

805
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,799
realize that these are users that are

806
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,439
security conscious

807
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,360
they're aware of password managers to

808
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,080
the point they use a password manager

809
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,120
for

810
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:06,000
uh pretty much everything and from those

811
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,158
aware users security conscious users

812
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,120
only 57

813
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,600
had adopted mfa so think about all the

814
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,279
other

815
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,279
half that that don't have mfa

816
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,559
and don't have password managers so

817
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,159
there's a big gap

818
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:24,080
there and even from the ones who did mfa

819
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,159
they went with the basic you know mobile

820
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,000
app route which is fine

821
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,679
but hardware solutions like yubikeys

822
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,960
like i use very few

823
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,480
use them biometrics even less people

824
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,399
think it comes in the way why do i have

825
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,919
to put my thumb print or whatever on the

826
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:41,039
phone to unlock it

827
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,840
they keep weak passwords on their phones

828
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,519
so it's a layered approach try to get in

829
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,199
a few of those layers in

830
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,760
so that you're a little bit more secure

831
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,760
than the rest

832
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,240
so these are some of the hurdles i see

833
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,279
so i talk to a lot of clients

834
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,080
try to convince them on mfa

835
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,640
and you know the objections i get are oh

836
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,519
it's

837
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,200
inconvenient you saw how i quickly how

838
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,720
quickly i logged into my twitter account

839
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,159
with with the yuba key it's

840
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:13,919
not inconvenient oh it's disruptive uh

841
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,720
so are seatbelts but we still wear them

842
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,919
uh

843
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,159
lack of interest um you know

844
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,240
if you don't have interest in the

845
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,120
corporate security or securing yourself

846
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,519
then don't

847
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:30,000
complain when you get hacked or the cost

848
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,919
the cost i guarantee you is less than

849
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,279
your netflix subscription

850
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,080
so you gotta weigh the the the options

851
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,880
there

852
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,960
but you know some of my more diplomatic

853
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,120
answers would look like this

854
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,159
acceptable level of risk that you're

855
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,120
willing to take

856
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,039
what is that uh do you have insurance uh

857
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,080
so if you get hacked and you still have

858
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,000
backups and

859
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,519
insurance policy and plan that you're

860
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,279
willing to spend money on

861
00:32:53,519 --> 00:33:00,159
you're fine there education and training

862
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,120
are you doing any of those things that's

863
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,760
going to

864
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,559
make the users accept this technology

865
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,559
better because

866
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,760
now they know what the dangers are

867
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:11,840
they're going to be more

868
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,840
comfortable adopting mfa

869
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,600
it's it's overall it's increasing your

870
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,720
security posture you ask

871
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,360
any cso or cto cio

872
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,960
what's your goal is it to increase your

873
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,279
security posture become more secure

874
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,559
they're like yes it is

875
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:30,480
and mfa is one of those

876
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,000
many controls that you can put in place

877
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,200
to increase your security posture

878
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,279
so there they should all be on board

879
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,559
leverage partners if it's complicated

880
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,760
you know you don't have to implement it

881
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,000
yourself

882
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,519
there's tons and tons of partner

883
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,440
organizations out there that will do it

884
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,080
for you

885
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,600
go with demos and proof of concepts if

886
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,678
you're not convinced yet

887
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,320
now and and i i talk about large

888
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,399
organizations not on an individual basis

889
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,320
you know you and i can simply you know

890
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,399
go on our phones and enable it

891
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,760
uh on our personal accounts this is more

892
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,479
on the corporate side the corporate

893
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,320
breaches

894
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,840
and that requires a little bit of

895
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,840
thought process

896
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,679
but the best practices on

897
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,800
uh implementing this so there's there's

898
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,320
a wrong way to do it

899
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,960
and then there's a right way to do it i

900
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,159
just broke mfa in a number of

901
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,240
ways social engineering and cookies

902
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,599
sessions stealing attacks and there's a

903
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,799
whole bunch of others

904
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,599
but there there's some best practices

905
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,520
around

906
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,919
around this so first and foremost use

907
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,199
better technology don't use sms's don't

908
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,719
use

909
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:40,560
you know emails as your 2fa

910
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,319
if you have to that's fine if there's no

911
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,520
other option that's fine but as long as

912
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,480
there's a better option

913
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,440
use that better option fine-tune those

914
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,399
things

915
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,918
if there's a geo-blocking option some of

916
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,399
the bigger vendors have that

917
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:56,000
use it there's a lockout policy option

918
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,680
uh enable

919
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,079
some of those things vendor vetting

920
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,720
when you're choosing for a vendor make

921
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,800
sure they have a secure development

922
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,759
software development lifecycle in place

923
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,760
are they constantly

924
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,359
patching and updating their systems

925
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,160
don't go for a vendor that

926
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,279
has not updated their software for years

927
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,680
it's going to be buggy

928
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,760
do they have support when you need help

929
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,598
do they audit their own systems

930
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,760
you can't trust a company that doesn't

931
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,599
audit themselves

932
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,359
backup codes always keep those in case

933
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,400
you lose your

934
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,279
yubikey or your phone or your second

935
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,839
factory device

936
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,280
you must have those backup codes i save

937
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,599
my backup codes on

938
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,359
my password manager under the notes

939
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,839
section

940
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,040
privacy hide information as much as you

941
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,599
can

942
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,800
i do a lot of awesome a lot of open

943
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,760
source intelligence

944
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,880
and i constantly see personal emails

945
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,560
phone numbers

946
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,040
their social media gives their date of

947
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,680
birth a lot of information is out there

948
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,720
for

949
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,440
password resets for breaches for

950
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,118
wishing phishing attacks suddenly all

951
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,160
the options open up to a hacker if

952
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,640
you're not private

953
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,680
but if you are you you lead a much more

954
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,680
private life

955
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,598
then the options are very limited and

956
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,399
then you can better protect yourself

957
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,200
with those

958
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,680
limited threat vectors that you expose

959
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,240
to a hacker

960
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,279
security awareness training is a must in

961
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,520
organizations

962
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,040
i considered this session today and all

963
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,440
the other sessions

964
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,320
today before and after me as security

965
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,119
awareness

966
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,400
sessions for for all of us the more we

967
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,040
know how stuff works

968
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,440
and how it breaks the better prepared we

969
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,480
are

970
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,480
to protect ourselves

971
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,078
i come from a very strong pen testing

972
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,640
background so i always say

973
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,760
if you're not testing your technology

974
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,160
your solutions

975
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,040
then it probably doesn't work the only

976
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,480
way to be sure

977
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:55,680
is pen test it hire a good pen tester

978
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,359
and try to break it it's it's not

979
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,118
foolproof

980
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,960
a pen tester may or may not succeed but

981
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,320
it'll give you some good results it

982
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,839
gives you a better chance

983
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,960
of survival against a hack

984
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,040
and then there's all these other

985
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,520
complementary technologies like

986
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,640
you saw me use password managers there's

987
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,800
content filtering

988
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,799
that would have avoided me clicking on

989
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,560
that phishing link in the first place

990
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,240
if i had the right content filter in

991
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,359
place it would have identified

992
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,439
that url as a known phishing url

993
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,440
or something else that was fishy and it

994
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,920
just would not have

995
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,400
gone through device posture make sure

996
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,960
devices are healthy there's no malware

997
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,079
in them and stuff like anomaly detection

998
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,320
all of this

999
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:44,240
helps back and forth one thing i did

1000
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,240
miss miss out pointing here was

1001
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,118
so for this for the yubikey piece

1002
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,320
so you see here when i was logged into

1003
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,160
my account

1004
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:59,680
um my hotmail account the url bar above

1005
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,960
said outlook.live.com that's fine but

1006
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,759
when i logged into this

1007
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,880
proxy server by clicking on this

1008
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,000
phishing link

1009
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,800
my url bar kind of went in

1010
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,079
a different direction it was let's let's

1011
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,359
click on that again

1012
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,560
let's open it in a new container so when

1013
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:20,480
i click on that

1014
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:24,160
it went to login.mailbox.office.live.com

1015
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,800

1016
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,839
com

1017
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,000
so it's it's not microsoft so here

1018
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:32,720
if i had used the yubikey instead of

1019
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,400
those three digit codes what a yubikey

1020
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,078
does that hardware token

1021
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,680
when i did that earlier you saw a little

1022
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,240
pop-up that came up here and

1023
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,960
asked me to touch the yubikey that

1024
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,598
pop-up

1025
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,800
actually looks at the url bar first it

1026
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,440
sees that that

1027
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,000
yubikey is registered for this account

1028
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,400
under

1029
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,160
that certain url and that url should

1030
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,240
have been outlook.com

1031
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,200
so if i had used this technique there it

1032
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,799
would have failed

1033
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,480
because my yubikey would have said hey

1034
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,560
this is not outlook.com

1035
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,320
let me fail that session right now so it

1036
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,599
would have failed

1037
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,599
but with sms codes or the or

1038
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,000
the six digit rolling codes it has no

1039
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:13,200
idea which site i'm browsing right now

1040
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,800
and that's why using a proxy attack

1041
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:19,279
technique like this

1042
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,280
a yubikey is the only form of defensor

1043
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,960
so i want to end with the cost because

1044
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,119
cost is a big concern a lot of people

1045
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,000
mention oh it's too expensive like i

1046
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,079
said it's uh

1047
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,680
less than your netflix cost on the

1048
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,440
corporate side on the private side

1049
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,078
there's three options

1050
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,839
but so here's my cipher message for the

1051
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,160
cost

1052
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,119
this is how much it costs it literally

1053
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,560
costs

1054
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:53,760
a cup of coffee per user per month

1055
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:56,000
so if you don't believe me here's um

1056
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,480
here's some of the published published

1057
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,520
costs from

1058
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,280
duo one of the big vendors out there you

1059
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,280
can go to duo.com

1060
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,280
pricing and actually look at their

1061
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,839
pricing model here

1062
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,200
there they have a free tier version they

1063
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,279
have

1064
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,279
an introductory version here but their

1065
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,599
most popular version is six dollars

1066
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,280
per user per month which gives you all

1067
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,599
those features that i talked about not

1068
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,640
just

1069
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,760
mfa but a whole bunch of other good

1070
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,879
stuff

1071
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,960
but not just cisco duo there

1072
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,960
microsoft has similar options similar

1073
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,839
pricing uh octa has

1074
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,160
very similar price structure uh and you

1075
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,880
know

1076
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,440
ping identity a lot of the others are

1077
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,839
around the

1078
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,800
same price point so you know the the

1079
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:44,319
bottom line is

1080
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:47,599
if if you can afford to to feed your

1081
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:50,960
employees uh coffee once a month

1082
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:54,319
you can definitely afford mfa

1083
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:57,040
there's cost should not and cannot be an

1084
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,040
excuse here

1085
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,560
so how do you get started with mmfa

1086
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,839
do a self-assessment or have somebody

1087
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:07,599
else assess your

1088
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:08,640
infrastructure make the right technology

1089
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,280
decisions

1090
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,400
review the vendor options do some case

1091
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,359
studies

1092
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,920
with a proof of concept and then adopt

1093
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,960
the right

1094
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,280
strategy there's many things to consider

1095
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,920
here

1096
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,720
but this is the methodology you should

1097
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,079
be taking

1098
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,319
to adopt it and it's not hard once done

1099
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,640
you are much more secure than you

1100
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,319
started off with

1101
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,560
thank you for having the patience to go

1102
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:37,839
through this and if there's any

1103
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,920
q a i'll take that right now so there's

1104
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,279
yeah there's one question around yubikey

1105
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,880
i think i just saw it

1106
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:47,359
um if using a yubikey how does one

1107
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,000
how does one as an individual user

1108
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:52,078
recover

1109
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:55,359
from a lost damaged token great question

1110
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,960
i use i have two yubikeys so when you

1111
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,078
buy a yubikey you always buy them in

1112
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,160
pairs

1113
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,920
and you register both with your account

1114
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,240
i've noticed some problems that some

1115
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,280
services won't allow you to register to

1116
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,279
yubikeys

1117
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,440
like google allows you to register

1118
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,839
multiple ubikeys more than two but then

1119
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,240
there are

1120
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,119
others that don't you can only register

1121
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,560
one

1122
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,520
in that case if you lose that one

1123
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,960
yubikey yeah it's not going to work but

1124
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,520
then this is why you have

1125
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,480
backup codes have those one-time backup

1126
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,800
codes saved

1127
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,560
every time you register yubikey they

1128
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,400
give you backup codes either one backup

1129
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,319
code or 10 backup codes

1130
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,920
save them because that's what's going to

1131
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:41,440
save you when you lose

1132
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:41,440
that hardware token
