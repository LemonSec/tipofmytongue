5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,759

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,800
here in 2020 much less be here this way

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,720

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,880
because the team scoreboard starts with

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,600
the

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,480
the winning team with 1285 points nice

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,800

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,240
that please

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,080
i'll give you the badges so we had

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,520
unsurprisingly significantly lower

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,679
attendance this year

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,158
but surprisingly good engagement on

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,040
discord so we will probably keep discord

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,439
in some capacity for the future

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,159
and uh we would like to thank all of

37
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,559
these speakers

38
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,680
staff and volunteers without you this

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,960
would have been

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,119
like the conference i attended on

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,360
wednesday virtually

42
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,360

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,920

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,920
discord and

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,920

58
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,399
