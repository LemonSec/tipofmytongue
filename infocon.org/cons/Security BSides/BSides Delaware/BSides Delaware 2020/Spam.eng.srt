[Music]

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,280
uh hi everybody i'm spam uh this is how

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,240
infosec skills can help you survive a

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,959
pandemic

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,440
um thank you so much josh and janice for

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,560
uh

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,680
for the introduction um and uh

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,080
gonna talk a little bit about uh i guess

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,320
infosec and hacker culture and how you

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,320
can use the skills you already have

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,519
uh to go ahead survive and thrive in a

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,279
pandemic

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,119
some of this stuff is gonna be a little

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,079
bit stream of consciousness a little bit

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,800
off the cuff um you know bear with me a

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,960
little bit as

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,239
with regards to that uh but i think that

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,800
there's a lot

19
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,839
that hackers can bring to the table a

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,800
lot of skills

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,000
a lot of mindset that can be really

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,280
really applicable

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,559
uh for reacting to a pandemic

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,559
uh so some of this uh talk came about

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,280
from conversations i had

26
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,800
before the pandemic just discussing how

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,960
for a lot of individuals

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,718
uh in the hacker community there's a lot

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,239
of commonalities that we see that are

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,680
totally outside

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,600
of infosec uh strictly so

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,119
uh obviously a lot of folks know a lot

33
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,479
of you know culture

34
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,159
media whatever movies music tv shows

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,080
stuff like that a lot of a lot of

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,360
similarities but there's also a lot of

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,240
hobbies that i think

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,439
you see folks uh getting interested in

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,119
for similar reasons that they're

40
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,119
interested in hacking

41
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,200
so uh one thing that i found

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,840
particularly interesting in terms

43
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,720
of a hobby is a lot of folks who are

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,079
into hacking

45
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,119
were into magic when they were younger

46
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,600
and i think the reason

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,640
that folks were into magic tricks maybe

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,679
they're younger and

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,799
some for a lot of folks also today is

50
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,520
for the almost exact same reasons they

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,159
are

52
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,119
uh you see something that is interesting

53
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,560
astounding

54
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,320
you don't quite understand it but it's

55
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,560
really really cool so

56
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,919
you want to be able to do that yourself

57
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,520
and you want to be able to tear it apart

58
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,920
and understand how it works

59
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,520
see how you could innovate on it see

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,920
what else you can do

61
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,720
but that mindset that thinking is

62
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,720
something

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,480
that is intriguing to folks in the

64
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,480
hacker community

65
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,280
and the mindset is one of the things

66
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,959
that's hardest to kind of teach people

67
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,680
and i think that mindset can be applied

68
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,239
for reacting to a pandemic and make

69
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,520
things

70
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,879
you know way way better for everybody

71
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,480
so a lot of what we see

72
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,399
in reaction to the pandemic is stuff

73
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,518
like this american catastrophe how do we

74
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,519
get here

75
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,519
oh there's here's the news the news is

76
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,920
going to give me the answer to

77
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,200
all of my you know what i'm looking for

78
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,679
um we know that

79
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,799
this is not true and unfortunately in a

80
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,680
lot of cases

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,720
there's a lot of fun out there um a lot

82
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,760
of what we're seeing

83
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,480
is just breeding fear uncertainty and

84
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,679
doubt

85
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,238
um and i think we want to a cut through

86
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,519
it

87
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,760
uh and also see how we can bring

88
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,440
a little bit of well certainty a little

89
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,679
bit of control

90
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,680
but also see where there's possibilities

91
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,000
for innovation

92
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,840
but with that being said one disclaimer

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,120
no one knows what they're doing

94
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,120
so i don't know what i'm doing

95
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,319
most people alive today have never lived

96
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,239
through a pandemic

97
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,760
so everybody's trying new things so

98
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,720
things aren't going to be perfect

99
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,798
but that's fine you know this is this is

100
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,599
absolutely i think where hackers

101
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,319
thrive we know that we're not going to

102
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,840
understand

103
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,599
all of what we're doing we're going to

104
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,280
figure it out as we go

105
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,280
we'll get some stuff right we'll get

106
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,480
some stuff wrong but we

107
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,000
will figure it out and we shouldn't get

108
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,159
discouraged if

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
some aspect of what we're looking at is

110
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,359
potentially failing along the way

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,319
we just go ahead and keep at it and make

112
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,080
sure

113
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,000
that we're going to go ahead and learn

114
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,120
from the experience

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,760
so with that uh without the the thing

116
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,159
that i see

117
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,159
overwhelmingly in people's approach

118
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,040
outside of the hacker community

119
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,000
to the pandemic that i think could use

120
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,720
improvement

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
is threat modeling basic threat modeling

122
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,680
if you look at

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,160
how folks were preparing for the

124
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,680
pandemic and how folks have approached

125
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,000
their responses

126
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,959
to dealing with the pandemic where it

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,440
was

128
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,280
just critically obvious that folks were

129
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,840
not taking the right things into account

130
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,880
is threat modeling individuals threat

131
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,280
modeling skills

132
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,000
are way off and even if i thought that

133
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,479
they were

134
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,080
not necessarily where they should be the

135
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,719
pandemic has proven without a shadow of

136
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,680
a doubt

137
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,720
that the average person is not great at

138
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,360
threat modeling

139
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,240
but hey as infosec professionals as

140
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,040
hackers

141
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,919
you can go ahead and do this uh and

142
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,720
actually

143
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,680
as i was uh preparing my slides

144
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,000
yesterday

145
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,120
i came across this tweet from lee

146
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,919
honeywell on twitter

147
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,040
which really summarizes a lot of what

148
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,198
i've been thinking about

149
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,080
and people's approach to risk management

150
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,479
and threat modeling

151
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,840
as it relates to pandemic so this is in

152
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,919
response to

153
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,280
tweets somebody talking about hey

154
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,560
there's going to be people need to

155
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,080
prepare for

156
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,440
another round of shelter and place

157
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,240
orders in different states and different

158
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,639
countries

159
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,080
uh says it says something that basically

160
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,800
none of my professional peers and

161
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,359
security

162
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,520
people whose job it is to manage risk

163
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,039
ever stopped sheltering in place

164
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,280
we have the advantage of being able to

165
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,280
work from home and most jobs

166
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,280
require it but the risk has yet to drop

167
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,599
enough to stop sheltering

168
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,520
there's you know it's right there it

169
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,440
summarizes so much

170
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,719
of what i think i want to talk about

171
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,199
here where

172
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,160
you go ahead and being able to step back

173
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,960
and not just

174
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,800
take a look at what's you know the the

175
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,680
 that's out there but taking a real

176
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,000
look

177
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,240
based on the evidences out there the

178
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,479
actual guidelines and saying okay

179
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,600
here is what i do here is where my

180
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,599
exposure is

181
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,199
here's my personal things whether you're

182
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,120
you know compromise or have

183
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,639
other things that put you potentially at

184
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,520
risk and you act

185
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,240
accordingly some folks have not

186
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,440
necessarily

187
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,319
done that early on in the pandemic

188
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,360
and maybe they you know they've relaxed

189
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,319
over time

190
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,240
but if you are looking at things in a

191
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,120
reasonable and responsible way

192
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,479
i think you're you're more likely to

193
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,840
have gone ahead and done your risk

194
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,800
analysis and realize

195
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,479
that the risk has been fairly consistent

196
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,440
and so your approach has been fairly

197
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,800
consistent

198
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,360
i know some friends of mine have

199
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,800
actually said friends who are not in

200
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,560
infosec have said like hey

201
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,600
you know like we oh we're all doing this

202
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,360
stuff and you're not you're doing the

203
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,680
exact same thing you were months ago

204
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,520
i'm like well yeah i have my i have my

205
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,080
approach i have my lines i look at it

206
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,198
and i'm not afraid of reevaluating it

207
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,599
but the overall risk has not

208
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,560
changed so my approach isn't necessarily

209
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,240
going to change

210
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,319
unless there's some other factor that's

211
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,080
coming into play um

212
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,000
and with some of this i know folks can

213
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,080
get bound up there's a lot of

214
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,479
you know emotional attachment to certain

215
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,479
things and sometimes it can be

216
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,000
difficult to separate you know to to

217
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,280
bring in aspects of

218
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,280
personal to business business to

219
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,119
personal with respect to this but i

220
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,758
think we'll all be better off

221
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,400
if we can you know i guess detach a tiny

222
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,280
bit

223
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,960
to do an actual analysis of the risk if

224
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,719
you're not already doing that

225
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,000
and make sure that your approach

226
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,759
incorporates that

227
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,199
when you're going ahead and figuring out

228
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,240
how you're going to deal

229
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,160
with something during a pandemic

230
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,280
and in terms of what we're doing in a

231
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,560
response

232
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,359
fundamentals fundamentals are key

233
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,039
whether it's in infosec or in how we're

234
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,240
dealing with the pandemic

235
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,719
so many corporations get compromised

236
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,000
not from somebody dropping oday on them

237
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,919
most most folks

238
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,039
are not looking at their threat model

239
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,039
doesn't include

240
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,400
a nation state where they're going to be

241
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,039
dropping oda on them

242
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,560
and you know to either cve whatever to

243
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,280
go ahead and compromise them

244
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,120
it's the fundamentals where they fail

245
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,960
and they get compromised

246
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,280
and this is absolutely the same

247
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,080
when it comes to approaches to a

248
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,119
pandemic

249
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,758
pretty early on folks were saying

250
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,639
uh in the medical community that if

251
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,919
people

252
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,520
did things like washing their hands

253
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,080
making sure they didn't touch their face

254
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,198
which admittedly i won't say that well

255
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,800
it may be fundamental

256
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,400
it's very difficult to train yourself

257
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,520
not to do

258
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,478
and wear masks and social distance we

259
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,679
can go ahead

260
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,039
and absolutely kneecap this virus not in

261
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,359
that we'll eliminate it

262
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,360
but that we will completely contain the

263
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,120
spread for that time

264
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,200
and early on folks were talking about it

265
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,240
as a way to give the hospitals time to

266
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,320
react

267
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,920
uh but it also now what we're facing you

268
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,040
know people call a second or a third

269
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,000
wave

270
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,920
it can give a bit of a reset and allow

271
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,040
us to ease restrictions now they may

272
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,959
come back

273
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:04,079
but it is absolutely key

274
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,160
to doing that and if you look at how

275
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,800
people approach the fundamentals early

276
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,800
on

277
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,719
focus people weren't focusing on that

278
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,640
stuff they were focusing on

279
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,480
bright and shiny objects what's a new

280
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,080
medical treatment what's a new way to

281
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,440
sanitize and other things

282
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,160
you would go to a store and you'd see

283
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,440
folks who had a uh they were doing runs

284
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,000
on toilet paper

285
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,760
or runs on um uh runs on hand sanitizer

286
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,360
um the runs on toilet paper i don't know

287
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,040
what people were thinking maybe they're

288
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,720
thinking they could eat the toilet paper

289
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,240
uh because the way people stocked up and

290
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,720
continued to stock up

291
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,760
it's just it's crazy but on the hand

292
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,519
sanitizer

293
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,160
people were looking at like i think the

294
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,959
labels on handstands i was like oh it's

295
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,480
99.99 effective

296
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,640
i better get this stuff because it's

297
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,160
gonna kill all the things i spray it on

298
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,199
stuff and it's going to be you know it's

299
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,760
going to be magical

300
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,000
well it's not magical you know in i

301
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,760
think in a lot of cases they found that

302
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,040
hand washing with soap for 20 or 30

303
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,240
seconds can be

304
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,079
even more effective hand sanitizer is a

305
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,800
tool for when you don't have access to

306
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,560
the other thing

307
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,719
but people were focused on the hand

308
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,599
sanitizer and not

309
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,279
getting soap i know when i went uh i

310
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,200
would go to like a drug store

311
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,800
and i'd see people frantically searching

312
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,399
for hand sanitizer

313
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,319
and then like in desperation they'll go

314
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,760
and they'll buy an anti-bacterial soap

315
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,360
yet the the shelves were stocked

316
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,120
with regular soap and folks were just

317
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,560
passing it by like no no no i don't need

318
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,720
that i need this other stuff

319
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,160
because this is going to be more more

320
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,279
effective when they weren't actually

321
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,319
stopping and realizing no what's the

322
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,279
fundamentals

323
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,560
yes there is a certain level of efficacy

324
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,600
that you may get

325
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,839
with the uh you know a hand sanitizer

326
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,480
or an antibacterial soap but the

327
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,360
fundamentals of those basics are what's

328
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,079
going to be

329
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,079
key the fundamentals aren't necessarily

330
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,880
always the most enjoyable thing

331
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,920
and it's it's difficult to maintain that

332
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,920
long term

333
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,959
for a lot of folks but they are

334
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,360
absolutely

335
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,560
key so you know i hope we can all keep

336
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,000
that in mind

337
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,880
as we go through this stuff

338
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,640
and the game has changed with regards to

339
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,800
that but it really hasn't

340
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,319
um i'm going to flip the script here a

341
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,519
little bit in that i think this is

342
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,399
something that

343
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,959
infosec has seen uh to a certain degree

344
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,000
with

345
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,839
companies reactions to the pandemic so

346
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,760
if you used to go into an office every

347
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,440
day rather than working from home

348
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,120
suddenly you need to be able to work

349
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,760
remotely all the time

350
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,120
so companies that were prepared for it

351
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,720
and had

352
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,560
formal ways for all of their employees

353
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,240
to work remotely they may

354
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,399
if they were actually well prepared they

355
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,600
will have gone and said okay

356
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,920
go home make sure your internet

357
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,360
connection's okay make sure you know how

358
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,560
to access anything that may have been

359
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,800
on-prem that you need

360
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,638
and we'll be good to go companies that

361
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,880
didn't have a way to deal with that

362
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,720
and didn't have a way to scale were

363
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,279
frantically going ahead

364
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,320
and potentially um setting themselves up

365
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,320
for compromise

366
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,440
by just opening everything up to the

367
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,600
world you know like

368
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,920
open up rdp to the world because i got

369
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,760
to access this box it's only accessible

370
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,040
on-prem and we don't have a secure way

371
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
to do it but the business is going to

372
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,920
die

373
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,439
if we don't do this and in some cases

374
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,240
they may have decided

375
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,040
that the risk was justified in those

376
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,360
cases

377
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,199
but i think they haven't necessarily

378
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,079
made the proper preparations

379
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,519
what we are seeing today this isn't the

380
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,239
90s

381
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,839
you know we have seen the need for this

382
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,040
growing steadily

383
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,720
over the past decade and now we're

384
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,639
seeing that come to a head

385
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,880
everything that we've seen up until now

386
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,920
is just getting intensified

387
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:45,360
um and sped up by the pandemic

388
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,680
but it really hasn't changed the overall

389
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,519
approach that we should have it may

390
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,839
change the rollout we may need to scale

391
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,760
in a different way

392
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,480
but it's really the same as what we've

393
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,600
been dealing with for quite a while now

394
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,320
and on that i think big thing

395
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,440
is being prepared we can all be good boy

396
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,120
scouts and

397
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,959
make sure that we're properly prepared

398
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,440
for what's what's going on

399
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,319
uh but as infosec professionals or

400
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,800
hackers

401
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,160
we want to hope for the best but plan

402
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,439
for the worst

403
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,639
um if we go ahead and plan for the worst

404
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,399
and we don't need to go ahead and use it

405
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:27,440
great but having that in our back pocket

406
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,959
is fantastic i know when the pandemic

407
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,040
started for myself

408
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:36,800
i went ahead and i uh a couple days into

409
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,959
me being at home working remotely

410
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,399
i took my edc and i kind of like splayed

411
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,638
it all out on a table

412
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,399
and i started looking okay what was in

413
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,959
my edc because it was a

414
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,600
decent tool to be used on occasion on

415
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,880
the go

416
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,160
one of my you know certainly took out

417
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,199
all the battery packs and everything

418
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,360
else i needed

419
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,319
only if i wasn't you know somewhere near

420
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,240
an outlet

421
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,440
thankfully plenty of outlets at home

422
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,959
separated okay this is going to be

423
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,839
useful some stuff i'm going to need to

424
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,638
replace

425
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,199
and it may have been something as simple

426
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,839
as just getting a decent microphone

427
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,439
um which i only uh kept at home a you

428
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,720
know kind of a cheapo headset

429
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,440
getting a decent microphone and

430
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,560
revisiting um some skills that i hadn't

431
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,120
touched in a while

432
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,239
in terms of dealing with audio and video

433
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,880
but it can be

434
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,160
lots of other stuff as well on the on

435
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,040
the pandemic side

436
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,639
strictly um i started taking a look and

437
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,760
doing an inventory

438
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:33,839
of what i had that would help me

439
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:36,160
respond should i need to self-isolate

440
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,519
uh and i said okay what are the

441
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,719
recommendations what do i need

442
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:44,000
so immediately ordered a pulse oximeter

443
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,360
made sure i had a um

444
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,440
some sort of temperature sensing

445
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,839
equipment um you know my

446
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,600
my uh i don't i don't have like a child

447
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,839
at home so i don't necessarily

448
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,519
have a bunch of thermometers and whatnot

449
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,959
uh and i actually realized that the

450
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,040
best thermometer i had was a meat probe

451
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,040
thermometer that i use in my oven

452
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,719
um so hacker in me was like okay well

453
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,000
let's see how accurate this is and if it

454
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,240
would work in a pinch

455
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,920
turns out the accuracy of my meat

456
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,440
thermometer was enough

457
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,120
but it's not something i want to rely on

458
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,680
okay so i ordered that stuff

459
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,880
and then i went out and i also stocked

460
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,160
up on

461
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,959
um just basic medical supplies um

462
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,760
again these are not the most exciting

463
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,959
things to do

464
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:30,319
go out and buy um you know

465
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,599
antihistamines and just stuff like i

466
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,440
know tylenol advil

467
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,600
ibuprofen stuff like that um making sure

468
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,560
based on medical recommendations that

469
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,560
they said hey

470
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,479
if you think you have covid at least

471
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,839
early on they weren't recommending

472
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,480
that you go out to get testing they were

473
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,600
saying hey

474
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,000
be in touch with the medical

475
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,720
professional and you should be prepared

476
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,399
to

477
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,480
have some basic medications at home and

478
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,480
my you know track your temperature and

479
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,720
if conditions worsen then you might

480
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,600
need to go to a hospital so having those

481
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,519
on hand

482
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:08,880
would allow me to react appropriately

483
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,680
it turned out that um i guess fates were

484
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,839
aligned

485
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,439
i needed to take advantage of that stuff

486
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,519
uh within a few hours

487
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,199
uh because actually only a couple hours

488
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,720
of from when i got home

489
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,199
from going out to shop for different

490
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,519
things i got a call

491
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,519
that let me know that a friend of mine

492
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,399
who was one of the early cases in new

493
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,320
jersey

494
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,079
um i had been exposed to him about half

495
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,720
a week beforehand

496
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:35,199
and so based on the fact that i was you

497
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,320
know in the same space as that person

498
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,800
uh within within about 10 feet of them

499
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,000
for about an hour i now needed to

500
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,439
shelter in place

501
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,160
for another week and a half since it had

502
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,480
been half a week since i was exposed

503
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,680
and if i hadn't had my two weeks of food

504
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,880
and everything else

505
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,638
you know there would have been i would

506
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,519
have freaked out then but at that point

507
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,199
i'm like hey

508
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,040
i'm happy i went out the last thing i

509
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,599
had to get were those you know basic

510
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,240
drugs

511
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,320
but i had that in place um and so the

512
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,079
anxiety over needing to

513
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,000
to collect these supplies was you know

514
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,399
much lower because of that

515
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,359
um so you know proper preparations

516
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,919
whether it's

517
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,599
a you know formal run book or just going

518
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,199
out and getting these basic supplies

519
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:20,319
the same things we want in infosec

520
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,559
is ways that you can help address

521
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,399
your needs during a pandemic and along

522
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,280
the way hopefully you pick up a few new

523
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,600
skills

524
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,360
i know uh like i said i've revisited

525
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,280
some audio visual skills

526
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,280
i did like college radio and did some

527
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,440
video production work when i was younger

528
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,000
um i've revisited a bunch of that stuff

529
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,799
um it has turned into kind of its own

530
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,799
little hobby um helping friends and

531
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:46,000
family members with some stuff

532
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:48,160
um and it is uh it maybe

533
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,600
you know i think hackers love picking up

534
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,160
new skills

535
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,080
and while these skills may not be as

536
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,679
directly relatable to hacking

537
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,678
as um as something like lock picking or

538
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,600
i don't know anything else like that um

539
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,559
i think there's still useful skills

540
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,199
and the the great thing about hackers is

541
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,520
that

542
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,520
we are constantly looking to pick up new

543
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,240
skills and test those new skills

544
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,320
so you know don't be afraid of that uh i

545
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,679
embrace it

546
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,240
uh as we go ahead and react uh

547
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,000
and we're going ahead and forming how

548
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,760
we're going to respond to things

549
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,600
we want to make sure that we understand

550
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,480
that what we're really doing here

551
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,959
is we're looking to reduce risk by its

552
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,919
very nature we're not going to be able

553
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,080
to eliminate risk entirely that's true

554
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,160
in infosec and it's true in regards

555
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,199
to how we're dealing with the pandemic

556
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,880
um i

557
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,480
i know for myself i'm certainly not a

558
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,280
medical professional and

559
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,559
i've been learning a lot about how you

560
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,120
know they're saying hey

561
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,399
we don't know the exact uh effectiveness

562
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,600
rates of these

563
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,720
um particular precautions but we know

564
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,520
that taking certain precautions

565
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,480
basics when you're dealing with stuff in

566
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,799
the pandemic

567
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,400
it reduces the overall likelihood and we

568
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,960
can reduce the risk to an acceptable

569
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
level

570
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,039
now that acceptable level is going to be

571
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,200
different for everyone for some folks

572
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,039
they may only be comfortable outside

573
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,320
more than six feet apart from everybody

574
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:19,520
other folks may be able to say listen i

575
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,520
don't have any immunocompromise issues

576
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,720
don't have family members who are at a

577
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,440
higher risk either

578
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,120
so maybe i'll be willing to go indoors

579
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,880
um there's a lot of stuff that's going

580
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,080
on with restaurants taking different

581
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,919
approaches

582
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,280
you have to reduce risk to a level

583
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,600
that's acceptable to you

584
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,399
but also understand that you're not

585
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,320
going to eliminate

586
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,480
risk entirely excuse me

587
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,600
and anyone who's coming along and saying

588
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,200
that they're going to be able to

589
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,320
eliminate the risk entirely

590
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,640
is probably lying to you and

591
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,000
just like if a vendor comes in and says

592
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,480
you know 100 percent

593
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,840
effective against all hackers and the

594
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,640
apts

595
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,559
you know it's not it's not real and

596
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,400
understanding that reality

597
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,240
uh and to take something from from the

598
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,039
military in a certain sense embracing

599
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,880
the suck

600
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,799
a little bit understanding that this is

601
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,480
going to be with us for a little while

602
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:14,158
um is is important as well

603
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,039
but as we're going through this we need

604
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,360
to make sure that we maintain balance

605
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,360
to quote thanos what we are looking for

606
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,879
is perfectly balanced

607
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,280
as all things should be uh and as we're

608
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,360
going ahead and crafting how we're going

609
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,200
to approach a pandemic

610
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,240
we need to make sure that we maintain

611
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,760
usability because usability matters

612
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,360
um what we're we're in here for is

613
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,200
you know an extended period i think a

614
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:47,280
lot of folks early on in the pandemic

615
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,280
did not view this as say a new normal

616
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,879
viewed it as something where hey we

617
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,080
could be through this

618
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,240
in the next month or two be through the

619
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,879
worst of it and then things will ease

620
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,679
so i'm gonna act as if that's the amount

621
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,840
of time

622
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,159
that i need to take on these precautions

623
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,280
for so let me structure it that way

624
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,480
well as you know as hackers as infosec

625
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,480
professionals we know

626
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,720
that that's not really the way threats

627
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,520
work threats do not

628
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,720
go away instantaneously they may lessen

629
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,039
over time

630
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,039
but it's going to potentially take a

631
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,200
while and we need to make sure

632
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,600
that we are prepared to maintain that

633
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,400
for a long time

634
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,559
and we need to make sure that that we

635
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,679
have that usability so that we can fight

636
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,678
burnout this is a marathon not a sprint

637
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,840
um i think some folks thought that hey

638
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,480
maybe it might not be over in a month or

639
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,600
so but

640
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:45,120
six months seven months in we'd probably

641
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,760
be in a place where we had reached um

642
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,399
call it a new normal call it an accepted

643
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,919
level

644
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,080
acceptable level of risk or extra

645
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,640
precautions but it turns out that we

646
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,000
haven't

647
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,960
um and i think if you had taken on

648
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,520
extra restrictions for yourself and

649
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,720
other or

650
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,360
others that were a little too tight

651
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,840
you may find yourself sliding to a place

652
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,559
where

653
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,760
you almost just give up uh and we see

654
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,639
this in infosec

655
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,559
all the time if you go ahead and put two

656
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,400
tight restrictions on folks

657
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,000
in a in an enterprise environment a

658
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,280
corporate environment you're going to

659
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,840
see folks

660
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,320
react negatively to it and figure out

661
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,918
ways

662
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,480
around it so in some some cities where

663
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,200
they've put

664
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,880
heavily restrictive um you know

665
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,200
impositions on folks

666
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,360
they have reacted strongly and gone

667
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,840
ahead and said hey i'm not doing this

668
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,158
and

669
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,918
they may be hiding it from you know the

670
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,600
public but they're going ahead and

671
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,360
working around the restrictions

672
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,199
so having something that is going to

673
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,918
work for you that's going to work

674
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,400
for the long term it's you know it's

675
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:54,320
really something we need to keep in mind

676
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:57,360
um and it is uh in the same way

677
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,480
that it's going to be different for each

678
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,799
individual

679
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,159
but we also need to be proactive and

680
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,039
make sure that it's working for the

681
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,720
folks

682
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,400
you know in our direct orbit um

683
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,120
and that starts bringing me to i think

684
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,480
some of the more proactive measures

685
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,559
we want to be proactive rather than

686
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,320
reactive so

687
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,000
in a network environment we might have

688
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,480
network segmentation

689
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,280
well that works that's perfectly

690
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,559
applicable

691
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,360
to what we're dealing with in a pandemic

692
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,639
on a basic level what we're propos what

693
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,399
a lot of medical professionals are

694
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,600
proposing with social distancing

695
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,159
well that's complete network

696
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,639
segmentation every individual node

697
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,480
is completely segmented from one another

698
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,840
so it's highly unlikely

699
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,080
that somebody's going to be able to

700
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,360
pivot from one system to another

701
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,120
and that's great but as time has gone on

702
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,479
well there's a balance that has needed

703
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,439
to be struck

704
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,039
that's not full-on network segmentation

705
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,840
so what have we seen

706
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,279
well hey maybe you need particular

707
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,639
machines to be able to talk to one

708
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,480
another on the network but you don't

709
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,120
want all machines to talk to each other

710
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,520
if you take a look at what some schools

711
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,000
and

712
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,760
other places have done they've used what

713
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,919
they're calling pods

714
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,039
um so what's a school's approach with a

715
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,200
pod well

716
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,600
we want to have students be able to

717
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,679
return to in-person learning

718
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:22,240
but there's a unacceptable level of risk

719
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,159
if every individual student is allowed

720
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,600
to interact as they would normally

721
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,559
with one another so by creating pods of

722
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,439
individual

723
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,639
classes of students and keeping them

724
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,240
together so they have

725
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,679
they try to maintain social distancing

726
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,840
as much as possible but

727
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,679
they're going to have ultimately we know

728
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,000
there's going to be closer interactions

729
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,279
between those groups of students but an

730
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,760
individual class

731
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,039
is not interacting with another class

732
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,279
they're only interacting

733
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,320
with their own class so if there is an

734
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,480
outbreak

735
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,360
it is more likely to be able to be

736
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,640
contained

737
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,600
to that class and the whole school does

738
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,919
not need to

739
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,120
shut down perhaps an individual class

740
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,440
may need to shut down

741
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,120
but the whole school doesn't this is i

742
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,240
mean it's to me

743
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,399
it's clear as day it's exactly the same

744
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,000
as what we are do what we would try to

745
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,559
do in network segmentation

746
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,600
um and so let's look at other proactive

747
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,039
measures

748
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:24,240
that are uh i guess kind of similar well

749
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:28,799
vaccines um i i think there

750
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:31,039
is uh when it comes to vaccines

751
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,320
uh when it comes to vaccines you know we

752
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,840
really should look at it as patch

753
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,000
management for humans

754
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,918
um you know there's a patch it took it

755
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,159
took some time took a couple months

756
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,039
for different drug companies to develop

757
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,360
and test

758
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,440
their patch for humans to give us uh

759
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,158
sufficient antibodies to fight this

760
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,919
um to fight this disease but now we're

761
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,120
hearing that hey there's some vaccines

762
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,080
that are in development

763
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,279
but the vaccines are not perfectly

764
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,639
efficient you know they're not going to

765
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,039
give us 100

766
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,320
effectiveness um i think before the

767
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,840
pandemic

768
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,678
i i pretty much would have just assumed

769
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,279
that hey they've tested it and maybe

770
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,720
it's not 100 affected but it's 99.99

771
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,799
uh but we're learning that this pfizer

772
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,440
vaccine is can is potentially

773
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,879
one of the most uh effective vaccines

774
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,240
that folks have seen

775
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,840
um because it's going to be 90

776
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,760
effective well that means one out of 10

777
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,240
people it's not going to be effective

778
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,158
for

779
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,240
well that's where that network

780
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,120
segmentation comes into play

781
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,880
because if we go ahead and we apply the

782
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,840
patches to the folks that we can

783
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,320
and we have that network segmentation

784
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,918
that's

785
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,240
that's what's going to hopefully get us

786
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:44,159
to reduce the overall risk

787
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:47,279
um and uh like patch management's

788
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,039
in an infosec situation where we're

789
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,159
applying the patches how we're applying

790
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,400
the patches and

791
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,320
what priority we apply the patches are

792
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,360
all going to become vitally important

793
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,760
i think it's going to be interesting

794
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,360
over the next few months to see how the

795
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,720
vaccine is rolled out

796
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,158
um and listen you may need to do uh

797
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,520
it may not sound like the most

798
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,000
comfortable thing of the world but

799
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,720
you're you're

800
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,279
on inventory management to to understand

801
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,039
this

802
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,559
um who am i going to interact with let's

803
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,120
say i get the vaccine

804
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,720
but my friends and family have not am i

805
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,639
going to go ahead and keep an inventory

806
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,480
of who has it and who doesn't

807
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,000
and what's my overall risk and am i

808
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,360
going to be willing

809
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,320
to accept that risk um but assuming that

810
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,399
we have

811
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,158
vaccines and we can layer some network

812
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,959
segmentation on top of that

813
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,399
well now we've gotten to what they call

814
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,000
herd immunity but

815
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,559
in a certain sense i think it's defense

816
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,720
and depth um

817
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,918
uh and i see somebody in chat saying

818
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,120
yeah the side effects

819
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,080
there are definitely going to be side

820
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,678
effects and i think that's going to

821
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,039
delay the roll out as well

822
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,919
um we're going to see that's why herd

823
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,840
immunity has been

824
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,919
is is accomplished by defense in depth

825
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,279
because you're not going to be able to

826
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,880
patch every system

827
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,200
you're not going to you need certain

828
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,399
availability on certain systems

829
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,520
so you need to be able to have

830
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:07,039
different approaches depending on what

831
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,600
we're dealing with

832
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,520
so by layering these different things we

833
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,279
can have that defense in depth and

834
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,440
develop a situation

835
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,480
even with straight vaccination if you

836
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,799
have 90

837
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,840
effectiveness i think they say overall

838
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,120
you need to mainta

839
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,480
you need to get about 80 percent of a

840
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,279
population

841
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,360
with somewhere about 75 percent

842
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:32,720
effectiveness of a vaccine

843
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:35,840
in order to get to herd immunity um

844
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:39,279
so there's different ways

845
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:42,080
that we can go ahead and do this so in

846
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,600
in the case of uh you know tying it back

847
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,720
to defense and depth and patch

848
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,559
management

849
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,399
you may not you'll patch certain systems

850
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,039
but you may turn off services

851
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,879
on other systems because you can't patch

852
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,440
it or there is no patch for a particular

853
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,679
system

854
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,480
but it's still vulnerable so you may

855
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,760
there may be

856
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,000
some folks who there is you know a 20

857
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,000
chance of an adverse medical effect so

858
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,640
they'll continue social distancing mask

859
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,039
wearing

860
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,640
and other things until a point where

861
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,720
everybody has reached herd immunity

862
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,640
because they cannot be patched yet

863
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,840
or maybe they'll never be able to be

864
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,080
patched um

865
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,959
if you look at traditionally way hurt

866
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,240
immunity

867
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:23,200
is relied upon there's always some folks

868
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,159
who are going to be unable to get to be

869
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,240
vaccinated

870
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,559
um and some folks who the vaccine will

871
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,600
never be able to have an effect on

872
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,480
uh so you know it is you know direct

873
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,360
parallels

874
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,360
between the two there

875
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:45,520
um and to that end i think

876
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:48,480
education uh is is really key

877
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,000
um i i think some of what we've seen in

878
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,760
response to the pandemic

879
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,640
education in some cases has been lacking

880
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,120
and listen we we see that in infosec a

881
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,840
lot

882
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,360
um security awareness training and

883
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,840
continuing education for

884
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,439
users users are the first line of

885
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,158
defense

886
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:12,240
and it comes down to them to ultimately

887
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,320
work with us or work against us to

888
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,720
accomplish what we need to do

889
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,639
going back earlier to the the general

890
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,159
concept for medical professionals

891
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,840
um we go ahead and we say

892
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,080
hey if everybody wears their masks and

893
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,279
just does these basic precautions we can

894
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,158
kneecap this virus

895
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,279
take it out but end users were unwilling

896
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,960
to accept that

897
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,399
uh i think part of it comes down to

898
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,679
education and if there is a better

899
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:42,719
education uh it can go ahead and make

900
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,480
the effect better um i'd like to suggest

901
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,000
that we should all take on some of this

902
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,080
education um

903
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,159
different communication methods are

904
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,678
gonna work better for different folks

905
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,840
so you know please speak with your

906
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,080
friends and family and see hey

907
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,760
are they understanding this are they are

908
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,360
they doing their own threat modeling

909
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,600
but also do they understand what's going

910
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,760
on with a vaccination somebody's nervous

911
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,719
about a vaccine like hey maybe i can

912
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,600
point you towards

913
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,519
some real information about the whether

914
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,199
this is the correct approach for you

915
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,880
or not um when it uh when it comes this

916
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,399
the the unfortunate side effect in the

917
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,919
real world is

918
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,840
that we also have to combat

919
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,480
misinformation uh

920
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,199
and to me that means you know education

921
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,200
isn't the end

922
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,399
it's the beginning it's exactly the same

923
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,399
way in infosec

924
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,080
just because somebody attends security

925
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,600
awareness training doesn't mean that

926
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,158
they're now aware and they never need to

927
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,959
revisit

928
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,640
it the threats are constantly evolving

929
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,519
our approach needs to be constantly

930
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,760
evolving

931
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,679
uh and it needs to go on over time

932
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,799
combating misinformation

933
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,360
uh and combating just um

934
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,720
incorrect interpretations of information

935
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,799
is going to be key

936
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,760
uh so please speak with your friends and

937
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,240
loved ones

938
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,679
uh and help them understand point them

939
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,000
towards resources

940
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,440
that they can use and maybe offer to

941
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,679
help walk them through that

942
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,360
if you're comfortable with it saying hey

943
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,559
here's what we know here's what we

944
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,039
understand

945
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,879
and let's go ahead and figure out an

946
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,640
approach that works for you and if it's

947
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,240
uh you're a family member and hey maybe

948
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,679
we want to be able to interact more

949
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,399
maybe we want to form if it's just a

950
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,159
friend and hey

951
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,678
we want to form a little pod and we want

952
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,720
to know that our overall risk level is

953
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,159
going to be acceptable

954
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,919
let's make sure we're all on the same

955
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,679
page let's make sure that we all

956
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,240
understand the actual risks that we're

957
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,240
dealing with

958
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,880
and this is where i think uh hackers

959
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,960
also

960
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,159
um just by necessity have to re-evaluate

961
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,360
and constantly incorporate new

962
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,880
information

963
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,320
and research skills being able to learn

964
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,640
new things uh

965
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,080
is vitally important and this is

966
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,200
something the general public

967
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,879
has sometimes struggled with when

968
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,720
uh early on in the pandemic there's

969
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,919
certain advice that's come out from

970
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,600
medical professionals

971
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,960
and then later on they say well hey

972
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,080
we've changed our advice

973
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,480
and you should do things a little bit

974
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,918
differently now well

975
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,760
some folks would look at it and be like

976
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,640
see the medical people know nothing

977
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,158
well hey we know they they knew certain

978
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,919
things at the time

979
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,240
and additional research has revealed

980
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:16,240
different approaches and different

981
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,679
uh um may i see the last results of your

982
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,600
vulnerability assessment before i let

983
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,320
you on prem yeah it's

984
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,559
it's there's you know new new things

985
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,720
have come to light man um

986
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,480
there's uh there's a lot of new

987
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,039
information always coming out at the

988
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,000
time

989
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:34,000
and just because current information is

990
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,480
contradicting something in the past

991
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,799
doesn't mean that it's untrue it's fine

992
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,600
to be skeptical of it but we should have

993
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,279
a way

994
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,799
to verify the information and

995
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,000
incorporate new information

996
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:48,879
and have you know trusted news sources

997
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,120
and trusted folks that we can consult to

998
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,919
be

999
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,039
able to get at the real information and

1000
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,240
differentiate

1001
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,320
what's going to be potentially

1002
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,440
misinformation from you know true

1003
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,200
information

1004
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,600
uh right after pfizer announced the

1005
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,960
efficacy of their vaccine

1006
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,000
all of a sudden russia was announcing

1007
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,159
well are our vaccines like was it 92 93

1008
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,440
effectiveness see more effective than

1009
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,760
the us vaccine

1010
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,480
well maybe it's true maybe it's not uh

1011
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,280
but for me

1012
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,240
from the sources that i trust i don't

1013
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,520
see any way of

1014
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,479
being able to verify that that vaccine

1015
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,239
is um

1016
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,079
is as effective as what they're saying

1017
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,879
and certainly no information

1018
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,919
on verifying if it's uh anywhere near as

1019
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,040
safe

1020
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,960
as what pfizer has developed um so

1021
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,879
incorporate new information but make

1022
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,280
sure that you're doing it

1023
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,639
in a way that is intelligent and takes

1024
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,040
into account

1025
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,359
all of your knowledge as an infosec

1026
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,320
professional

1027
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,679
um and let's see if we can incorporate

1028
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,679
least privilege

1029
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,280
you want to constantly lease privilege

1030
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,480
limiting your exposure by limiting who

1031
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,960
has access

1032
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,599
um well hey that's directly applicable

1033
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,640
here

1034
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,720
um in a corporate environment you see a

1035
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,440
lot of folks talk about leased privilege

1036
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,839
as

1037
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,640
an approach that's going to be not

1038
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,279
something you're going to

1039
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,920
turn on immediately uh it's a least

1040
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,240
privileged

1041
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,520
journey and it may just be you know

1042
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,240
that's the sort of thing that sounds

1043
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,359
nice

1044
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,160
but that least privileged journey is

1045
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,640
real

1046
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,440
um you you want to go ahead and take a

1047
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,359
look hey

1048
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,560
here's the access i have is there

1049
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,400
another way i could do it that's

1050
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,119
potentially more secure

1051
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,720
or is this something that i don't really

1052
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,560
explicitly need

1053
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,839
um obviously we need to have that

1054
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,320
balance

1055
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,320
but that balance may be different hey

1056
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,920
maybe this is the general guidelines but

1057
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,240
because of my own

1058
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,040
approach to things i can be more

1059
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:46,078
restrictive for myself

1060
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,240
um uh you know i love going to movies

1061
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,760
but i'm not going to movies during the

1062
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,720
pandemic

1063
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,839
because while the risk of infection at a

1064
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,839
movie theater

1065
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,440
is probably fairly low as long as

1066
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,078
there's social distancing and everything

1067
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,560
else

1068
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,960
it's not a risk that i need to take i

1069
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,720
can sit at home and watch a movie on tv

1070
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,640
and that's perfectly acceptable to me

1071
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,959
for for the foreseeable future

1072
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,640
i'd love to see tenet but i'm not gonna

1073
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,520
be able to see it and you know that

1074
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,598
sucks but

1075
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,119
hey this is something i'm willing to

1076
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,200
live with um

1077
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:22,400
it may be that hey i'm i'm unwilling to

1078
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:25,439
uh fans of going to uh you know

1079
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,400
live theater uh hey i i'm not willing to

1080
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,680
give that up

1081
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,880
but maybe i'm not willing to give that

1082
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,359
up because i i can find a way

1083
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,720
to do that safely can't do an indoor

1084
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,040
theater but now there are theater

1085
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,399
companies that are conducting

1086
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:43,520
outdoors um so hey i can substitute that

1087
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,520
where i have a less risky alternative

1088
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,680
so please try to apply the concept of

1089
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,680
least privilege and don't be afraid

1090
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,960
of hey i've pared back and i'm saying

1091
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,759
i'm not doing this stuff

1092
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,880
then making a little more exception you

1093
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,440
it's not going to

1094
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,800
always be perfect this is going to be a

1095
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,200
learning situation

1096
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,240
you're going to adjust and adapt over

1097
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,598
time

1098
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,680
if we you know we can be super super

1099
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,280
restrictive you can go and live in your

1100
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,399
basement with some canned food and a

1101
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,839
bucket in the corner

1102
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,599
and never interact with another human

1103
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:16,160
being for the next year

1104
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,760
theoretically you can but what's that

1105
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,000
going to do to your mental health

1106
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,359
and are you really prepared to do that

1107
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,880
probably not

1108
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:27,279
there's always going to be gradations

1109
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,640
of what we're willing to do what we're

1110
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,320
willing to accept

1111
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,759
so even if you're going ahead and

1112
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,560
staying at home and only getting

1113
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,160
deliveries

1114
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,759
there is a certain amount of risk to

1115
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,879
doing that and

1116
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,760
in certain situations it may be less

1117
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,000
risky

1118
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,000
for you to go out and go grocery

1119
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,040
shopping once every two weeks

1120
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,480
then get delivery every day

1121
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,640
take a hard look at it and don't be

1122
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,720
afraid to revisit it

1123
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,160
and you know make sure you understand

1124
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,799
what your own

1125
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:00,078
risk tolerance is as you're going ahead

1126
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,079
and taking a look at this stuff

1127
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,680
last thing i want to bring up is

1128
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,359
tabletops uh

1129
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,078
proper preparation prevents poor

1130
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,200
performance um that's that's why we do

1131
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,200
tabletops

1132
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,720
um but i think when it comes to the

1133
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,560
pandemic

1134
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:19,359
we can use tabletops um to

1135
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,240
uh to take a look at what we're likely

1136
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,078
to encounter

1137
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,520
now i don't expect everybody to have a

1138
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,880
covered response

1139
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,880
um ir playbook uh but you're

1140
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,320
if you can go ahead and tabletop

1141
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,440
different scenarios that you're likely

1142
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,640
to encounter

1143
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,960
i think you're more likely to

1144
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,078
have less anxiety about decision making

1145
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,280
in the moment

1146
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,680
and you're more likely to go ahead and

1147
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,920
actually act in situations where

1148
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,319
hey you might have wished you reacted

1149
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,320
differently after the fact

1150
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,560
you know tabletop scenario if you're

1151
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,160
just simple something that everybody

1152
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,400
pretty much is doing going to the

1153
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,399
grocery store occasionally

1154
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,640
if i'm in line at the grocery store

1155
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,520
checking out and somebody's encroaching

1156
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,960
on the six feet between people is that a

1157
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,400
level of risk i'm

1158
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,960
willing to accept if that person is

1159
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,839
wearing a mask versus not wearing a mask

1160
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,040
what is the level where hey this is an

1161
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,200
increased level of risk

1162
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,560
but i'm okay with it versus this is an

1163
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,598
increased level of risk and i'm gonna

1164
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,520
walk away

1165
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,680
know what your limit is ahead of time

1166
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,400
and if you walk into a grocery store and

1167
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,640
you see everybody's not wearing masks

1168
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,160
and you're not okay with that okay

1169
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,879
that's the point where i'm gonna put the

1170
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,960
grocery

1171
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,079
uh you know put the basket down and i'm

1172
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,480
gonna walk out

1173
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:37,920
and hopefully not have anxiety over it

1174
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,800
because i've gained it out ahead of time

1175
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,599
um when we go ahead and also think

1176
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,000
through

1177
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,920
conversations you're gonna have uh with

1178
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,880
uh thanksgiving and other holidays

1179
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,800
coming up

1180
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,160
a lot of folks are gonna have what

1181
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,960
unfortunately i think are some

1182
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,240
uncomfortable conversations with friends

1183
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,400
and family members

1184
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,598
uh if a family member says hey i haven't

1185
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,280
seen you in so long

1186
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,280
you know please come come for

1187
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,920
thanksgiving want to go ahead and see

1188
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,640
you

1189
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,400
um think through that ahead of time

1190
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,200
everybody has their own threat model

1191
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,280
everybody has

1192
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,319
their own risks that they're willing to

1193
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,960
accept so

1194
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,440
understanding ahead of time if you go

1195
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,880
ahead

1196
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,800
and know that hey okay i'm willing to go

1197
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,440
ahead and go to this family member's

1198
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,079
home

1199
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,480
uh but i'm not willing to eat inside

1200
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,280
well

1201
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,200
hey i i live in new jersey it's getting

1202
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,560
pretty cold outside the likelihood that

1203
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,839
we're going to be able

1204
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,560
to uh to eat outside based on how cold

1205
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,759
it is

1206
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:38,078
it's pretty unlikely if you live out in

1207
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,880
sunny southern california yeah that may

1208
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,520
work

1209
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,359
uh and and that may work for you but

1210
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,680
think through it ahead of time

1211
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,279
uh because in the moment there's gonna

1212
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,919
be all sorts of stuff

1213
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,720
flowing through your head um so you know

1214
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,560
please

1215
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,240
think about it make sure you understand

1216
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,920
how you're going to react why you're

1217
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,078
going to react

1218
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,000
and there's going to be scenarios that

1219
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,319
you're not going to think through

1220
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,440
but think through as many of them as you

1221
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,920
can

1222
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,520
um and and i think tabletops also bring

1223
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,400
into play

1224
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,599
all of the different skills that we've

1225
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,160
that i've been bringing up throughout

1226
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,920
this

1227
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,839
whether it be you know threat modeling

1228
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,440
risk analysis how you're going to deal

1229
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,279
with network segmentation

1230
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,960
and all the rest it kind of ties

1231
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,000
everything together

1232
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,079
and i think the more aspects of life

1233
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,520
that we can go ahead and take that

1234
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,520
hacker mindset and apply it to

1235
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,640
we'll be better off for it and we won't

1236
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,759
just survive

1237
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:41,200
we'll thrive uh and so

1238
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,240
with that uh that is the presentation

1239
