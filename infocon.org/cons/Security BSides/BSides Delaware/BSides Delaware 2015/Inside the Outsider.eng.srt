1
00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:06,930
great so um no I didn't really volunteer

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:10,550
I opened my email a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks ago and i</font>

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:14,190
was told that i was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be easy</font>

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,960
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need got it by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this guy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">i was going to be the keynote speaker</font>

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:23,340
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually thought it was a joke i</font>

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,570
sent him a<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just shot back a real quick</font>

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,330
email and I was like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are joking</font>

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,698
right and as evidenced by the fact i'm

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,699
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front of you today no he wasn't he</font>

11
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:36,300
wasn't joking<font color="#E5E5E5"> but he is right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i am</font>

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,480
incredibly incredibly nervous it is my

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,280
first solo speaking gig in about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15</font>

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,610
years usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm hiding behind that guy</font>

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,809
over there and so in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help me</font>

16
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:50,360
this some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you in the audience look at</font>

17
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,360
this actually for the wardrobe change

18
00:00:52,579 --> 00:01:01,739
figured it would give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:03,329
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it no no no</font>

20
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,720
no no no they've already lost my place

21
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,340
in my notes because of that so i hain't

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,900
microphones just bottom line is<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,100
absolutely hate them<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could probably do</font>

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,360
this talk if you at all like scoot

25
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,059
really close and I just stood in front

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,039
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like like it was back in school</font>

27
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,229
but um when I when I realized that Josh

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,400
wasn't joking I really really struggled

29
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,840
with whether or not I should accept the

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,820
offer I knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he had considered me</font>

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,130
because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mini rant that I had</font>

32
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,380
subjected him and him and Janice to a

33
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,759
couple months<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and because of that I</font>

34
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,250
didn't know what the hell I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to</font>

35
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,990
talk about when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got up here I am it</font>

36
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,090
was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tough the stuff I had talked</font>

37
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">to them about was kind of crusted over</font>

38
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,020
some lines and I didn't I wasn't sure

39
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:46,770
what I was going to do so I made a list

40
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,360
cuz lists are good and the first column

41
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,740
of this list was things I like to talk

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">about and this was pretty easy right</font>

43
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,920
because they end up being comfortable

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,939
things I like to talk about my kids I

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,680
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about good books and I like</font>

46
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,600
to talk about food specifically I like

47
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,030
to talk about chocolate with my favorite

48
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,390
thing in the world and occasionally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

49
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,950
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about myself right so when I</font>

50
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,410
came to<font color="#E5E5E5"> making part two of that list</font>

51
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,069
which is things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't like to</font>

52
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about that got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit harder</font>

53
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:18,159
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in general the topics were easy</font>

54
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:19,840
enough to come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with but you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

55
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,429
again things you don't like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,900
about and they're largely uncomfortable

57
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,139
things so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> surprised myself because the</font>

58
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">very first thing I put down was me as</font>

59
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:30,099
much as I like to talk about things like

60
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,899
done experiences I've had and you know

61
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:34,869
tell you funny stories about my kids I'm

62
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,000
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> rarely really talk about Who I</font>

63
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,760
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what I'm feeling and what I'm</font>

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,799

being a mom are really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only two</font>

84
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:37,720
areas of my life that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> consider myself</font>

85
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:39,189
an expert in and it's not because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

really good at either of them it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

87
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:44,108
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in thousands and thousands of</font>

88
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:45,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">hours doing exactly those two things the</font>

89
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:47,109
last thing I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

90
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:48,879
now is seeing I've already missed my

91
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:52,449
slide these stupid red lines aren't

92
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,939
working the last thing I'm going to tell

93
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:56,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">you is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that i consider myself deep by</font>

94
00:03:54,939 --> 00:04:00,310
proxy and not by practice i long ago

95
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:04,120
gave up any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of technical training</font>

96
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:05,889
technical path and has only been

97
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,259
surrounded by it almost every day of my

98
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:13,959
life for the last 20 years in part due

99
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:20,360
to being married<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bruce but who yeah</font>

100
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:31,110
yeah let's go with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all right</font>

101
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:34,460
my desk is not not not large net so we

102
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,690
just lost my plate I'm sorry so on paper

103
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,400
that list i just gave you that I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mom</font>

104
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,140
that I'm the lead organizer shmoocon in

105
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,210
that I'd have absolutely no technical

106
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,240
technical expertise doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really look</font>

107
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,430
like I have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer you on paper</font>

108
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,830
and that's exactly what I felt when they

109
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,780
asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to gain to give this talk I</font>

110
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,520
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really know why they were asking</font>

111
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,520
me like why me and why does anything I

112
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,229
have to say why would that be important

113
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,599
and Bruce kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of laughed at me I'm</font>

114
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk about him a lot because 20</font>

115
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,960
years but he kind of laughed at me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

116
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,520
pointed it out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was having a</font>

117
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,900
pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> episode of something that's</font>

118
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,880
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> impostor syndrome now imposter</font>

119
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,320
syndrome is not as commonly thought the

120
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,760
fear that people are going to like

121
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,980
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out you're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as smart as you're</font>

122
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,390
pretending to be it's kind of a

123
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,540
byproduct if you will it's a bit of a

124
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:23,810
fuzzy line but more accurately it's the

125
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,530
inability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recognize one's own</font>

126
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:29,160
expertise one's own accomplishments

127
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:31,049
one's own abilities and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess in other</font>

128
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,540
words it's just a bunch of self-doubt

129
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,400
right so it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've all felt</font>

130
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,650
at one point probably multiple points in

131
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,010
our lives and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> greatest example that</font>

132
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,140
I have of this is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it took me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

133
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:45,210
to say out loud that I wrench makan I

134
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,740
would dance<font color="#E5E5E5"> around that subject like it</font>

135
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:50,489
was nobody's business I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say things</font>

136
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:53,310
like well I help run the<font color="#E5E5E5"> con or I do</font>

137
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,830
most of the logistics and fact of the

138
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,330
matter is I own the business I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

139
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,909
the finances I make all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the major</font>

140
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,229
decisions and doesn't matter that I pull

141
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,370
in a bunch of opinions or talk to a

142
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,340
bunch of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make those decisions</font>

143
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,810
when it comes down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I'm reliable I</font>

144
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,549
mean I'm alive I'm reliable but I am

145
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,800
responsible more to the point for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

146
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:18,450
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything related to the conch god I</font>

147
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:20,940
hope I'm reliable I'm here aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> I and</font>

148
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,830
and I should take just a second cuz as

149
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,390
Josh was saying this morning it's not

150
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">that she finds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a one-person show it</font>

151
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,450
isn't it all it takes an army of people

152
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put on an event like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this and</font>

153
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,050
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put on shmoocon and I</font>

154
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,020
wouldn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and can't do it without</font>

155
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,259
those folks but

156
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:39,219
in part due to those people that today I

157
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:41,789
can easily say that I wrench<font color="#E5E5E5"> makan but</font>

158
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:46,389
here's another recent example of

159
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:47,830
imposter syndrome when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I first started</font>

160
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:50,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tell people that I was going to give</font>

161
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,000
this talk you know some folks were

162
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:53,590
really cool they were like you know

163
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,030
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do great I know you're</font>

164
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">really nervous this is going to be</font>

165
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,289
awesome just go get<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm Heidi and those</font>

166
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:00,849
people there now my<font color="#E5E5E5"> best friends if they</font>

167
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:04,780
weren't already that they are totally my

168
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:06,099
best friends but<font color="#E5E5E5"> other folks were maybe</font>

169
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,789
a little more hesitant they like well

170
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:11,500
that's cool or it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of like this</font>

171
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:12,818
we you know read between the lines sort

172
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,440
of impression that I was getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

173
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:17,110
like well why would they thank you and

174
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,880
the reality of the situation is they may

175
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,440
or may not have meant that right but my

176
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,259
own insecurities were coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> into play</font>

177
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,909
and again I was stuck in the position

178
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:26,770
where I didn't know what I had to offer

179
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:30,520
any of you so real quick because I feel

180
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:34,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">like I owe you just a little bit more I</font>

181
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:39,068
have a pretty pretty geeky pass my first

182
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:40,359
computer was a Timex Sinclair I remember

183
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:41,830
setting it up<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> birthday</font>

184
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,599
parties<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all these kids coming over</font>

185
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,550
and they had no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea what it was I wrote</font>

186
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,069
my first program on that computer yes it

187
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,779
was hello world my father was the

188
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:51,190
technology coordinator for a school

189
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:54,460
district and I remember going<font color="#E5E5E5"> with him</font>

190
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:57,009
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> teacher in-services and teaching my</font>

191
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,198
teachers literally how to turn on the

193
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,580
would bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> us from school to school to</font>

194
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,009
show teachers<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was coming in year</font>

196
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:09,639
was installing like the IBM lab at the

197
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,669
high school or something so went pretty

198
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:15,039
fast during that time period right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

199
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:16,930
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet really early in I can't</font>

200
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember now 6 7th 8th grade I would had</font>

203
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:24,969

204
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:28,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">much never left the internet after that</font>

205
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:30,190
I went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> school in Alaska met Bruce up</font>

206
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:31,900
at University<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Alaska Fairbanks I</font>

207
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,140
studied math like him I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not get my</font>

208
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">degree and we both went to work at</font>

209
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,649
Alaska's largest isp so i worked at

210
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:40,328
internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask i worked front desk</font>

211
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:41,120
customer service<font color="#CCCCCC"> i worked in marketing</font>

212
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:42,709
and

213
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,670
when I left I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually the lead of</font>

214
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:48,230
the customer care department so then we

215
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,779
moved to Virginia I quit working and i

216
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">took this huge long break from anything</font>

217
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:55,820
related to to tech except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact</font>

218
00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:00,439
that during this time the shmoo group

219
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:01,670
had been<font color="#E5E5E5"> created and we that was still</font>

220
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,620
kind of bubbling around and they were

221
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,599
having their heyday<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to defcon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

222
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,550
should go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> a second and say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd</font>

223
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">eat all of them i went to DEFCON 5 while</font>

224
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:12,819
I was pregnant<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my first child not</font>

225
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,930
an experience I would recommend but um I

226
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,450
was just kind of on the you know the

227
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,709
edges of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this movie was kind of a</font>

228
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,660
saying they had this name for themselves

229
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,089
and I was sitting at home with my kids

230
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,370
reading all the emails as they went by

231
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:27,380
when we moved to Maryland that's when

232
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">the idea of shmoocon came about and I</font>

233
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,939
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah I'm in so</font>

234
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,800
for the first three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years I wasn't in</font>

235
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,660
charge but I was at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top level and I</font>

236
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually took over running the</font>

237
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,339
conference and the rest is pretty recent

238
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:44,600
history so I've told you all of that and

239
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:49,040
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's pretty much my resume</font>

240
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,750
for why I'm here today I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

241
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,390
tell you that I've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> once in my life</font>

242
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,740
considered myself a hacker but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it should</font>

243
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,180
be telling on one of my high school or

244
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,320
high school and elementary school and

245
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:04,130
middle school nicknames was brain yeah

246
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,560
that's a good one so I can look at all

247
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:09,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">those things I just told you and I can</font>

248
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,439
force myself to rationally understand

249
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:14,450
that it provides me sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of knowledge</font>

250
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the basis for the rest of what I'm</font>

251
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,589
going to tell you today but I still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

252
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,360
a hard time accepting it right I still

253
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:22,310
feel like I'm sort of on the edge of

254
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,370
what all of you guys are doing despite

255
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:28,300
the fact that I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for so long</font>

256
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:31,550
and longer than most of you in this room

257
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:33,319
so it's imposter syndrome right I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

258
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,329
struggle with it all the time and here's

259
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,820
the things that I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help me with</font>

260
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:39,290
that I first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all and I'm going to</font>

261
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,560
totally sound like a mom when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say</font>

262
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,420
these things but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I am</font>

263
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,829
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're not perfect</font>

264
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,560
everyone fails at one point multiple

265
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:49,220
points all the time in their lives

266
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,819
recognize it's important to recognize

267
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:55,000
what you don't know

268
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,410
it is also important to embrace the

269
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,060
knowledge that you do have and work to

270
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:02,319
increase that knowledge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> frankly</font>

271
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,119
calling out what you're feeling just

272
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,070
calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> it what it is saying I'm feeling</font>

273
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,530
like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know anything or I you know</font>

274
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:10,360
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an austere syndrome whatever</font>

275
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:12,040
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really helps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too so I pretty much</font>

276
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,390
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> went through that exercise in front</font>

277
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,550
of you and I'm still nervous as hell

278
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:19,750
right so do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it works and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

279
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:23,199
doesn't work but we see a lot of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

280
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,160

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually kind of leads into my next</font>

282
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,540
topic because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> once shouldn't surprise</font>

283
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,210
you that the phrase<font color="#CCCCCC"> imposter syndrome</font>

287
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:43,689
in accomplished women they studied about

288
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:49,719
150 women and all of them felt this way

289
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:54,340
to one extent or another so I'm zooming

290
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:56,920
past Maya my slide marks here gender is

291
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,560
a huge topic there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot here that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

don't want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and i don't</font>

293
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">even really feel qualified to talk about</font>

294
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,300
except that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a woman i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

295
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,340
pretty strong<font color="#E5E5E5"> feelings about a few</font>

296
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,130
things but they probably aren't what you

297
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,860
think they are and first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all i hear</font>

00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:17,650
all the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we how we need more</font>

299
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,090
women in STEM and in particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can't</font>

300
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:21,370
tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> often I see statements like</font>

301
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,410
we need women STEM fields to break the

302
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:28,480
stereotype that's like thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> Captain</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Obvious your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful so here's my stick</font>

305
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,090
not many things in<font color="#CCCCCC"> life we truly need</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you go back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that list at the very</font>

I like to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about food food is</font>

309
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,840
something I need right but of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course we</font>

310
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:45,220
want more women in STEM as a group of

311
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,260
course women offer a really unique

312
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:50,020
perspective and diversity of any kind is

313
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,660
usually a good thing and there are there

314
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">are large numbers of studies being done</font>

316
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,800
done that tell us why we have this

317

deficit of women in this field and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

know that

we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of those reasons are</font>

institutional<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're generational their</font>

321
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:13,500
cultural and that we need to address

322
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:15,930
those in order to get more women<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

323
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,819
field but going back to the original

324
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,670
statement we need more<font color="#E5E5E5"> women in STEM so</font>

325
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:26,219
all the stats<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I looked at we're on</font>

326
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:27,719
the technological side of stem if you

327
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,399
don't get a degree in stem or aren't

328
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,000
fulfilling a technical role you're not

329
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,920
in stem and I think but for biting from

330
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,110
fighting so hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point out all these</font>

331
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,639
important rules you're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

overlooking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the contributions that are</font>

sales marketing graphic artists and you

know even<font color="#CCCCCC"> as slowly conference</font>

this we've had an enormous well enormous

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we've had like six but that's a lot</font>

of submissions to the shukran cfp from

talking about industry trends and and

good business<font color="#E5E5E5"> practices and you know</font>

344
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,920
maybe they fit our program maybe they

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> but is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information useful</font>

346
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,349
absolutely that information is useful

347
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:14,910
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get it I mean I get that if you</font>

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,230
graduate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a degree in marketing</font>

349
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,069
you're not going to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> up as a tick</font>

00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:22,019
mark in a survey about stem graduates

351
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:23,790
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the time you're entrenched in a</font>

stem based company hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> working for</font>

353
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:30,360
a greater good surely that should count

354
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,399
as a tick mark in some survey about STEM

355
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,290
careers and that's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my point and</font>

356
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,730
in the end this really trans transcends

357
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,170
gender I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put these silly slides</font>

358
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,910
that they're playing on the word support

359
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:42,959
women but really take out the word women

360
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:45,059
and put in people right my entire career

361
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,829
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really a career but my</font>

362
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:48,569
entire working life has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in small</font>

business<font color="#E5E5E5"> started out in internet Alaska</font>

364
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:55,889
my involvement in Fort Knox that's an

365
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:57,480
OCS not the other one<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus company</font>

366
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:58,680
pauna tech and of course shmoocon and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

367
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,170
can tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in those environments</font>

368
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,750
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people where many many different</font>

369
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:06,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">hats and it's just really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important not</font>

370
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:10,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">to overlook contributions that are</font>

371
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,939
technical and not technical so

372
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,990
inclusiveness is a really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> big</font>

373
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:17,319
thing

374
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:19,750
so one way in this community that we try

375
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,330
to promote inclusiveness is through

376
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,310
codes of conduct<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this shouldn't be</font>

377
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,260
unfamiliar codes of conduct are a pretty

378
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,989
common thing they exist at schools and

379
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,819
workplaces and over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last number of</font>

380
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,590
years the<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing thing has been that</font>

381
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:37,900
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being put in place at</font>

382
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:40,180
conferences and large gatherings<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

383
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,069
to clarify this isn't a new idea it's

384
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,660
been around for a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

385
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,440
been at the forefront of a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

386
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:50,410
discussions around<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec and</font>

387
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,780
conferences like this and mostly that's

388
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,459
because of issues and sadly involving

389
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:58,030
women but the policies are there they're

390
00:15:54,460 --> 00:16:00,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">really there to protect everyone not</font>

391
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:03,339
just a specific gender or specific

392
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:06,640
lifestyle basically codes of conduct are

393
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,900
a nanti harassment statement and compass

394
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,280
thing and courage and discouraged

395
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,319
behavior and they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good</font>

396
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">reporting mechanism outline you know who</font>

397
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,730
to contact who to call what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

398
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they serve a purpose it's true and</font>

399
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:19,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not at all saying that they're bad</font>

400
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,760
but it probably isn't a surprise<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

401
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:26,740
don't not really behind the movement as

402
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:29,650
a whole I'm what I'm frustrated with is

403
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,480
the cookie cutter cut<font color="#E5E5E5"> paste attitude</font>

404
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,920
that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of conferences have had it</font>

405
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">just as in reaction to this it was</font>

406
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,990
pretty easy you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know when this call to</font>

407
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:40,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">action came to play to just go to ADA</font>

408
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,590
initiative site<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're now defunct</font>

409
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,120
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to the website go to the Code of</font>

411
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,200
pick one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that fit you change a few words</font>

412
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,970
and be done so I'm also frustrated with

413
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,710
the fact that some of these policies

414
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:53,590
that get developed are so overzealous

415
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:55,240
and the attitudes that accompany them

416
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:58,420
actually start to infringe on the rights

417
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,950
of free and<font color="#E5E5E5"> public speech and I get that</font>

418
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,020
a conference isn't really you know a

419
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,450
public space it's not the quad<font color="#CCCCCC"> on campus</font>

420
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,220
where everybody can go protest but

421
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:10,360
there's a need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> also protect the</font>

422
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:11,980
rights of the speaker right so a big

423
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,719
part of the rationale<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind putting</font>

424
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,339
these codes of conduct into place was

425
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,050
that there's this claim<font color="#E5E5E5"> that simply</font>

426
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,000
having the policy will prevent

427
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,319
harassment and I'm just going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sit</font>

428
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,780
here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure we</font>

429
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of proof of that but I</font>

430
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">will concede and absolutely agree that</font>

431
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,740
having a

432
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,060
policy in place really does help those

433
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,730
who are looking to know that they have

434
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:34,980
support from the organization that's an

435
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,920
absolute truth and and a codes of

436
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:40,890
conduct really do put a lot of

437
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,420
responsibility on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> con organizer of</font>

the conv organization behind the

conference and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not at all sure</font>

440
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">'king that responsibility I work very</font>

441
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,100
hard at shmoocon to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

442
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,700
staff is trained we're doing more and

443
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,020
more each year we're also working to

444
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,330
actually train our attendee to work with

445
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">us to make sure that we are providing an</font>

atmosphere that's welcoming and and

447
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:06,030
opened it everybody but I claim it's

448
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:09,900
more than a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-way street it's it takes</font>

449
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:12,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of us it's sort of a thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font>

450
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,550
the like a rounded out for my traffic

451
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,320
analogy here takes all of us working

452
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,659
together to create an environment again

453
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,210
that isn't marginalizing or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Birtley</font>

454
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,490
hostile while maintaining open

455
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,020
disclosure because uncomfortable

456
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,000
conversations do you need to happen and

457
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,590
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I claim that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we all need to work</font>

458
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,620

459
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:35,939
experience expectation sorry as a

460
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:37,949
community so let's talk about the

461
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,900
community we see this word thrown around

462
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,790
a lot on Twitter and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook and this</font>

463
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:45,240
is our community our hacker community

464
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:47,399
our infosec community and you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

465
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,350
sort of stretch between industry

466
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,130
community and then sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see the</font>

467
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:54,449
word family I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the word family</font>

468
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,820
here's how I choose to look at it a

469
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,890
family<font color="#CCCCCC"> is part of the community and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

470
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">community is a function of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> industry</font>

471
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:04,080
right so by definition avoiding anything

472
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,580
that mentions bloodlines a family is a

473
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,919
group of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people united by certain</font>

474
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,800
convictions a community is a body<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

475
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,930
persons persons of common and especially

476
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,280
professional interest scattered

477
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,800
throughout a larger society and an

478
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:21,270
industry is a group of businesses that

479
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">provide a provided particular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> product or</font>

480
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,080
service so industry is driven by money

481
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,400
driven by capitalism it's going to make

482
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,070
decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are in the best interest</font>

483
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,220
interest of that industry right family

484
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:34,860
is a more closed group right it's a

485
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,020
closed group that<font color="#E5E5E5"> where like-minded</font>

486
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,758
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> often like blood is thicker</font>

487
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,918
than water place

488
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:42,690
what it's supposed to be and neither<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

489
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:44,519
those models in my opinion represents

490
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,799
what needs to happen in order to make

491
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:49,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">infosec a better place community on the</font>

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">other hand I think bridges back that it</font>

493
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:53,908
allows us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be free and individual</font>

494
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:56,070
thinkers and innovators with the ability

495
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:57,329
to learn and share information without

496
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,119
needing to fit in in some kind of

497
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:01,739
abstract way and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't a disparage</font>

498
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,418
those who use that word right I've got

499
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:05,459
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of friends who use the word family</font>

500
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:07,589
and I'm not purposely calling any one

501
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:11,249
person or group out because this isn't a

502
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:12,869
personal thing I'm fully aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font>

503
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:14,399
is semantic argument and I'm tending

504
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:16,678
towards being pedantic and i'm just

505
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:18,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to admit that right now and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

506
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,319
have our chosen family there are people

507
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,698
in this room that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are part of my chosen</font>

508
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:23,729
family they're people in this room I

509
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:27,179
have to call family maybe that was by

510
00:20:23,729 --> 00:20:28,769
choice to go I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for many</font>

511
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:31,169
of us the word family has a stronger

512
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:33,269
meaning and in an industry where folks

513
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:35,699
are often already socially challenged

514
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:37,829
and disadvantaged it's pretty easy to

515
00:20:35,699 --> 00:20:40,769
feel like you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a part of this</font>

516
00:20:37,829 --> 00:20:42,448
elusive family we should absolutely

517
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:44,099
continue to focus on building a

518
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:46,949
community where inclusiveness matters

519
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:49,379
and where again ideas and free exchange

520
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:51,989
of information is encouraged and the

521
00:20:49,379 --> 00:20:54,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">bottom line again is use whatever word</font>

522
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:55,679
you want right just be aware that though

523
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:57,209
your word choices may or may not have

524
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,819
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same meaning to the people who are</font>

525
00:20:57,209 --> 00:21:00,899
hearing them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore they may have</font>

526
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:05,579
the opposite effect that you're

527
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:08,129
intending so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not a Star Trek</font>

528
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:10,459
reference but those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you who know me</font>

529
00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:12,119
well knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd get one in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here somehow</font>

530
00:21:10,459 --> 00:21:13,589
but I thought while we were talking

531
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:14,908
about family would certainly talk about

532
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:18,658
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next generation this one's going to</font>

533
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:20,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">be pretty short I am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> especially here I</font>

534
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:21,599
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we all celebrate the next</font>

535
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,009
generation right Randy<font color="#CCCCCC"> University</font>

536
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,149
there's lots of kids in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room they're</font>

537
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:25,499
students here and I think that's

538
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:27,559
fantastic so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

539
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:30,079
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> preaching to the choir but</font>

540
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:32,879
more often than<font color="#CCCCCC"> not I run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> across</font>

541
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,769
comments that say they call the call out

542
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:36,689
the noobs or they call out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tourists</font>

543
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:38,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">or they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call out the wannabes and this</font>

544
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,279
is followed by this<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

545
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:42,239
people have nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to contribute</font>

546
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:43,240
because they haven't walked the line

547
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:45,460
they have a porn thing

548
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:49,120
hard way and you know of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

549
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,620
haven't the hard problems that our

550
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,090
students today are facing are not the

551
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,678
problems we face ten years ago they're

552
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,449
not the problems we face 20 or 30<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

553
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,770
ago they're learning differently in part

554
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,510
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all the work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font>

555
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:00,250
done to put these programs in place to

556
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:03,129
put on conferences like this to set up

557
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:06,880
the better curriculum<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the schools so</font>

558
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:12,520
that they can be smarter and and have

559
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:14,080
better access to to the education<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

560
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:17,590
they need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be successful in this in</font>

561
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,570
this industry and there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for</font>

562
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:22,300
this to be like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fraternity or sorority</font>

563
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:25,290
where you have to do go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

564
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:28,090
initiation to be part of this club and

565
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:30,480
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little silly maybe even to say</font>

567
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,850
but part a big part of life is paving

568
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:38,050
the path for what comes behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> us right</font>

569
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,790
some motivation changes as we get older

570
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,559
I see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time experience it</font>

571
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,960
myself life happens kids have been

578
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,649
and adapt this attitude<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I just saw</font>

on Twitter and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to totally it's</font>

00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:14,200
right big jump to personal security i

584
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:16,840
have long subscribed to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bruce Potter</font>

585
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,400
theory of privacy is dead so I asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font>

586
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,379
to define this and like two bullet

587
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,000
points and he said in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

588
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,650
meaningfully participate in today's

589
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,540
society you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to give up what we</font>

590
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:27,850
conventionally think of as<font color="#CCCCCC"> privacy and</font>

591
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:30,970
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> trend will only continue as we</font>

592
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:33,219
get more connected so yeah privacy is

593
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:36,070
done that being said the Potters are

594
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,450
pretty private people<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright but what</font>

595
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook Heidi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm on</font>

596
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,870
facebook all the time and it's a great

597
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">way to procrastinate just about</font>

everything in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your life including</font>

599
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,890
writing this talk but here's my pretty

600
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,850
much singular point about this topic

601
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:50,440
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference between accepting</font>

602
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,320
known risk versus jumping into something

603
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,669
without knowing the risk at all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

604
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,439
had a facebook come for years and didn't

605
00:23:54,669 --> 00:24:00,040
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all and it wasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> until</font>

606
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:02,230
we went on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the epic cross-country bike</font>

607
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,850
journey with JP there in the back that I

608
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,320
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> checking into Facebook a lot</font>

609
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I found that it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a really</font>

610
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,929
really easy way for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to get</font>

611
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,700
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what was happening</font>

612
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,170
back home and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was also a really easy</font>

613
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,600
way for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to push information out about</font>

614
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:16,030
our trip so yeah I'm on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook every</font>

615
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,409
day and yes I use my real birthday and

616
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:20,320
if you remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that list at the top I</font>

617
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:23,020
can feel he like chocolate but for the

618
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,760
Potters it's all about balance right so

619
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,930
we try to be active in managing whatever

620
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:30,160
information you have out there that's

621
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:32,230
either private or public while accepting

622
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,330
whatever risk it is that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to in</font>

623
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:36,070
order to accomplish our goals<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

624
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,780
know again sometimes I goal is a silly

625
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:39,220
is telling you the words of wisdom that

626
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,770
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> five-year-old has uttered at three</font>

627
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:46,540
o'clock in the morning but it's what

628
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:47,620
gets me through my day so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've</font>

629
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,210
talked about all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that I</font>

630
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,459
didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk about I</font>

631
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,930
realized that almost everything I've

632
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,310
said today has had some kind of caveat

633
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,780
I've said things like well I don't want

634
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:57,970
to offend you<font color="#CCCCCC"> or I'm not saying that</font>

635
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,950
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that might come across</font>

636
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:02,410
as defensive or trying to soften the

637
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:04,390
blow and it's not it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a reminder</font>

638
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:06,610
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone has opinions to offer and</font>

639
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:08,950
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> listening to all sides is a key</font>

640
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:10,419
component to progress right so for much

641
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:13,690
of what I've talked about it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even</font>

642
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:15,820
that I'm right or that I'm wrong it's

643
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:17,080
that I've tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start a discussion in</font>

644
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,639
my hope is that everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've said</font>

645
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,659
here today promotes further discussion

646
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,160
if you're going to be part of this

647
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">community these things are going to come</font>

648
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,440
into play<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm going to leave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

649
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,850
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> one less silly little mom ism I</font>

650
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,530
life<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't about being the best it's</font>

651
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:32,050
about being your best and being your

652
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:35,730
best includes being open to ideas and

653
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,730
suggestions and always always learning

654
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,850
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to click on</font>
