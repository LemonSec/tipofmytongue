00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:03,349
who you are what you're talking but

170
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:05,299
there are things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are posted and</font>

land you in a lot of hot water<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

175
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:22,940
one of my favorite tools to use for this

176
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:28,860
we spoke up anything else like polka

177
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:31,410
really no booking this stuff is<font color="#E5E5E5"> long it</font>

still<font color="#E5E5E5"> works you point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at a website</font>

179
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:36,750
and it just DA's<font color="#E5E5E5"> documents and then it</font>

180
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,250
grabs those documents that they were

181
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,190
kind enough to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the internet for</font>

182
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:43,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">you and it pulls out the metadata so you</font>

183
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,240
can point it at an organization and get

184
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,490
a less diffuser right in a list of

provoca

187
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:07,340
so what makes it special is the things

188
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,530
you can do with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is where</font>

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:32,870
exactly how much OSN this generating has

195
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:35,030
a deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now but we know it's like</font>

196
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:38,380
upwards of five million dollars a year

197

companies coming companies go but this

203
00:09:54,749 --> 00:10:01,319
is a fantastic in terms of opportunity

204
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:04,679
you take the stuff you dig out of the

to run a disinformation campaign<font color="#CCCCCC"> on you</font>

504
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:51,150
in SLE me it just makes business sense

505
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:55,110
it's just another form of marketing it's

506
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:57,720
bad it's evil but it's just business the

509
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,490
the stuff is out there it's available

510
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,660
and it's got crazy just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

511
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:09,660

516
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:20,989
maybe you're evil by nature you can't

you

520
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:32,240
the classic on the internet know the

521
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,240
underdog

522

<font color="#CCCCCC">the intelligence report</font>

523
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:41,960
but of course with the disinformation

524
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,879
comes the problem understanding

something about what it is you're after

00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:34,140
so there's layers to this it makes

intelligence<font color="#E5E5E5"> game so much fun</font>

how much

you can use things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like admit before</font>

manually if you know where your targets

it's tedious<font color="#CCCCCC"> until you right we'll do it</font>

solves a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentagon</font>

558
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:33,020
remember me when<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happens please the</font>

559
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:35,809
difference between modern data mining

00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:38,090
and intelligence collections with all of

<font color="#E5E5E5">this technology is the leverage before I</font>

process now i can use essentially the

00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:48,830
mechanical turk right I can turn loose a

collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bits of information and</font>

pull together a piece of open source

exposing the acid

570
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:05,500
we don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get into the</font>

layers all<font color="#E5E5E5"> ties together</font>

572
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,040
if you're not careful with that like say

00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just gave the information out to a</font>

single person that person cannot sell

575
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,419
the fact we can tell that information

576
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:18,980
somebody else information

577
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,980
it's creative intelligence

578
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:25,209
that you can do lord of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Technology</font>

579
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:28,529
faster for example we're doing some

<font color="#CCCCCC">research for this topic</font>

581
00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:34,489
we have weekly passes for some

00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,630
it can be one person sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

584
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:43,140
can write a script do it all for you

585
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,720
almost everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> is scriptable right</font>

586
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,280
home so if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it with a tool you</font>

can do it a hundred times and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two of</font>

reticles

591
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:59,700
the fun aspect of the initiative<font color="#CCCCCC"> scheme</font>

little piece of information and

595
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,900
cost me<font color="#E5E5E5"> one hundred thousand dollars</font>

day<font color="#E5E5E5"> just was which ones more possible</font>

599
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:19,279
that's for the buoyancy to decide

something it's just dollar figures it's

603
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:29,330
cheaper for me to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to Detroit to</font>

um

608
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:44,110
the concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of meta intelligence thing</font>

609
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:47,340

an actual spider organization this was

627
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:45,560
actually a problem for a while we had

628
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:48,140
intelligence assets than reusing acting

629
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:50,030
like that the data think it was showing

<font color="#E5E5E5">up because what happens when you start</font>

that was a known problem

641
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,219
I assume ever was reading the slides

642
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:44,539
so some interesting sources for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:07,919
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you qualify and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's a lot harder</font>

651
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,390
to gain access they actually want you to

652
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,149
be affiliated with the government

00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:15,400
and you looked at government websites

because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we didn't want</font>

but they're dangerous so just forgot

789
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:33,240
about it but the stuff is out there were

790
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:36,240
we being drama queens to be so panicked

00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:00,630
so one of the things material is<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes</font>

00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:03,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">about is the fact that the people who</font>

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,330
but in reality was not that much bias

803
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:13,890
but it shows up ironically more often at

804
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:16,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">the management level than it does at the</font>

management talking about five dollars

808
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:27,620
and proof and what makes me look good to

809
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:29,580
management and they have a tendency<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

810
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:32,970
minimize open source intelligence

because it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> as useful</font>

812
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:39,959
ious they think that if they steal fact

using an asset that it is more

814
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:48,030
actionable more factual than if you put

the pink slip ask all people important

836
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,340
see right

837
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:49,940
but studies have shown it that there's a

00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:52,940
lot of effectiveness yourself one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

841
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:59,078
acquiring stuff all the time

842
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,140
it's

843
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,060
you thought we were going to give you

okay then

846
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:12,499
of course as I mentioned because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font>

players on the internet there's a huge

849
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:19,999
signal-to-noise ratio which means

850
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:21,589
opportunity if you can write<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>
