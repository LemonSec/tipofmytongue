12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,559
lot of time on snort and network

security monitoring and hacker spaces

14
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:45,379
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I run one and conferences</font>

15
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:47,960
because I run to do a lot of other

16
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:51,410
random projects so lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different fun</font>

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,989
things also inch spent a lot of time

18
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:57,769
learning about<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning which is kind of</font>

19
00:00:53,989 --> 00:01:01,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">a fun meta conversation that's kind of</font>

20
00:00:57,769 --> 00:01:03,679
what we're focused on the day so we all

21
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:08,539
hear about kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one of the problems</font>

22
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:10,310
is that we as an industry are short and

23
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,700
the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> varies depending on who you</font>

24
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:16,280
ask but 10 20 30 40 50 hundred thousand

25
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,159
people who have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> skills that we need</font>

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,509
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fill the job roles we need and part</font>

27
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:22,640
of that problem stems from the fact that

28
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:24,920
people don't actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> write the correct</font>

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,450
requirements for the job they may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,090
someone in HR writing the job

31
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,439
requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> or a manager who doesn't</font>

33
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,758

<font color="#E5E5E5">the technical needs of the role those</font>

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,030
other side of it is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pipeline</font>

38
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,810
right now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of broken and that's</font>

39
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,780
what I'm mainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be focusing on</font>

40
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,460
today so a lot of student or a lot of

41
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">people go through various degree</font>

42
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,500
programs high school programs come out

43
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,259
with some interesting background

44
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,259
knowledge but a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times don't get</font>

45
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:07,850
that hands-on experience that infosec

46
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:09,680
demands to be functionally useful and

47
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:12,680
there's quite a few categories of

48
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,700
infosec when it comes down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it trying</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin them down</font>

50
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,010
is kind of fun so obviously here good

51
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,170
bit about digital forensics<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instant</font>

52
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,179
response now security monitoring it's

53
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:26,809
all becoming much more popular topic

54
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:29,860
threat Intel can't spit not<font color="#E5E5E5"> help to at</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend ethically because that's</font>

62
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:50,238
obviously a good thing but you know

<font color="#E5E5E5">getting that experience of understanding</font>

looking for more reverse engineers there

<font color="#E5E5E5">that speciality compliance which a lot</font>

71
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,680
of us hate because well its

72
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:22,540
documentation it's the I won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

73
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:25,160
non-technical but the focus is more on

74
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,440
legalities than it is technical

75
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,690
specificity there's a ton of generalists

76
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,120
tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations will have the IT</font>

job and then vendor solution developer

<font color="#CCCCCC">the folks who I've got this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> product</font>

80
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,840
let's talk about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

81
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,030
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and how you'll pay my</font>

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,069
company money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's research</font>

83
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,739
folks and other unique snowflakes don't

84
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:50,268
fall under one of these categories

85
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:54,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to some downstairs who do kind</font>

86
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:56,170
of the building or researching methods

87
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,609
to do some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these other things so</font>

88
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:02,059
researching some threat Intel like stuff

89
00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:05,180
to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify attackers and how to</font>

90
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:08,500
detect them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just one</font>

91
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:11,000
example but there's a ton of different

92
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:14,650
categories but which of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these really</font>

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,720
have a structured learning opportunity

94
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,519
for most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these compliance obviously</font>

95
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,260
you read the book that details the

96
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,900
compliance and probably take some law

97
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,789
classes because a lot of lawyers get

98
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,370
involved when lawsuits happened with

99
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:29,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">compliance</font>

100
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:32,070
but for the rest of these there's not

101
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:38,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">really a structure or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of training</font>

102
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:42,750
available so some of the other fun

103
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:45,930
things diversity we kind of have a very

104
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,900
focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> filled with a lot of white males</font>

105
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:52,380
which is the thing so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

106
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:55,020
programs out there to try to help some

107
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:58,280
other groups girls who code in cyber

108
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:01,409
jutsu or to focus on girls or ladies

109
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,960
separate cells as a woman's side of

110
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:07,020
things and then there's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other</font>

111
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:10,380
groups they were really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to</font>

112
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,820
find even in a couple hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just</font>

113
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:15,750
googling around and Twitter<font color="#E5E5E5"> and whatnot</font>

114
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:18,270
I had a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of actual fun finding them I</font>

115
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,460
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example there's a spanish or</font>

116
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:23,310
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> hispanic infosec professionals</font>

117
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,770
group but couldn't find a website or<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

118
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,160
details on and anywhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know it exists</font>

119
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:31,830
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've spoken to a member</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

120
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,770
finding any actual information was

121
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:37,050
failing miserably also there's military

122
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:41,010
groups that are designed to help folks

123

<font color="#E5E5E5">make the transition from you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I was</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">in let's say you know a grunt or navy</font>

125
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,479
guy or one of the other name or one the

126
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,490
other groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of did more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

127
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:56,340
the aisle may be classified<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff but</font>

128
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,560
not necessarily IT in any way<font color="#CCCCCC"> shape or</font>

129
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,739
form trying to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transition after</font>

130
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,210
they get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out well a lot of a lot of a</font>

131
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,590
lot of folks tend to choose I teen

132
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:07,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">infosec because there's a lot of</font>

133
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:10,859
opportunity and there are programs again

134
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:14,010
to help those folks develop finding them

135
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,660
is not simple a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times on the out</font>

136
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:18,030
boarding from the military<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have</font>

137
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,880
some of those available these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

138
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:22,198
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that I found in a few would</font>

139
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,650
help if I actually had the right slide

140
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,630
up so Google sukkot cyber jutsu<font color="#CCCCCC"> was two</font>

141
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,479
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then here are some others</font>

00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are more focused around veterans</font>

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:38,729
a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good description of what what</font>

149
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">realistically this look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like dress shoes</font>

150
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,110
so probably not as much that but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

151
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,000
an interesting article<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the transition</font>

152
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,419
there are groups that are designed

155

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:11,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">and not easily available so then we have</font>

off hand but Air Force Association is

179
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:14,580
kind of the prime on that and then

180
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:18,570
basically they give students from across

want to say they had 1,800 1,900 teams

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,219
know they were looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expand that</font>

00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,470
from the computer Security Awareness

196

focus challenge their US cyber challenge

201
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:16,380
actually is a program where you

202
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:19,260
basically take a test but if you do well

203
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,600
enough you can get invited to the

204
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:24,089
training camp training camp has<font color="#E5E5E5"> 41 day</font>

205
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,660
versions effectively what's a sans class

206
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:30,899
and then a CTF on Friday again that's

207
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:33,329
completely free so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a really</font>

208
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,529
interesting program to go visit<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

209
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:36,329
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's targeted towards college</font>

210
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:39,600
students I know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of professionals</font>

211
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:43,439
ended up doing it anyway that's also out

212
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,790
there cyber<font color="#CCCCCC"> ases at the high school</font>

213
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,320
division of that unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

214
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,560
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> training camp they do have some</font>

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:53,100
online material the National Cyber

216
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,109
League is well I hate the word cyber but

217
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,589
national cyber leak was an interesting

218
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,930
challenge because kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of exposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> log</font>

219
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:04,860
analysis and forensics and some of the

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:06,779
other skills crypto steganography in a

221
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,880
challenge that was targeted towards

222
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,620
college students and they put<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name</font>

223
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,230
up on their<font color="#CCCCCC"> website if you did well</font>

224
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,480
which turned into a very strange phone

225
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:20,670
call from<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone finding a phone number</font>

226
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:22,350
for me from<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years ago mitre CTF I</font>

227
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,319
played a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of years ago as well and</font>

228
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,910
a lot of companies are starting to use

capture the flag and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other challenges to</font>

230
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:32,670
drive education because as you play a

00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:34,469
challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> you end up having to go</font>

232
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,810
research something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you didn't know</font>

233
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,100
coming in pretty much<font color="#CCCCCC"> a guarantee if</font>

234
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,229
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing the challenge correctly</font>

00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,410
solutions on most the most of the

240
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,360
challenges will have write-ups on what

241
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,540
some of the solutions were so you can

242
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,269
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn not solutions the</font>

243
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:03,930
problems how they solved them and we're

244
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:06,610
in your thinking you you stopped and see

245
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:12,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the natural progression to get to</font>

246
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:14,970
that understanding can be within

247
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:19,140
academia there's a few groups that

248
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:22,589
target creating that cyber security

249
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:25,480
training and education type environment

250
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:28,060
cyber watch and cyber watch West have

251
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,310
money from National Science Foundation

252
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:36,369
to do just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they also provide course</font>

253
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:38,290
where and what not UTSA has a group that

254
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,630
runs the National Collegiate cyber

255
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,760
defense competition and works with all

256
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,260
the other ones that's the CIS and then

257
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,130
they actually have a information

258
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:51,700
security education conference so

259
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:53,890
teachers who teach<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec a conference</font>

260
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:58,630
specifically for them with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> horrible</font>

name called sissy<font color="#E5E5E5"> si is se or the</font>

267
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:17,560
biggest takeaway was they need help they

268
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:21,850
want help from industry and they're

269

<font color="#CCCCCC">looking for us to get involved so some</font>

somewhere on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> midwest</font>

289
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,660
somewhere and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started a project</font>

290
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:28,240
on github recently to start identifying

291
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:31,000
some labs around network security

292
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,139
monitoring again<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back to the the</font>

297
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,899
teaming there's a ton of material out

298
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:46,209
there and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked a lot about that at</font>

299
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:49,060
different conferences but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it comes</font>

300
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:51,160
to defense there's not been as much

301
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:55,060
focus for example when you think of

302
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:58,000
defensive cons or hacker cons that<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus</font>

303
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:01,319
on defensive skill sets you really

304
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,240
struggle to come up with naming a couple

305
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:05,860
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> sans is out there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously that's a</font>

306
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,720
little bit more targeted normal more

that there really isn't a ton of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

310
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:22,990
defensive focused options or for any of

<font color="#E5E5E5">the other categories I mentioned the</font>

00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:34,120
few additional conferences specific to

that no look on our besides<font color="#E5E5E5"> NOLA I</font>

forget which one the two is very very

317
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:45,309
very heavy in forensics so a couple

<font color="#E5E5E5">other tools obviously suggesting</font>

00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:51,069
internships life journey was kind of an

320
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:53,500
interesting group that tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to map out</font>

321
00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:58,000
what skills you need for specific jobs

322
00:14:53,500 --> 00:15:00,819
and create a path to actually getting

323
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">into say reverse engineer yes did you</font>

324
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:03,149
have a question

325
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,029
yes they're downstairs

326
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:35,100
yep cyber jutsu women definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> is out</font>

327
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,570
there I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find their logo when I</font>

328
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,210
was searching but that's just because it

329
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:41,670
was really busy they definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist</font>

330
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:45,740
and they definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> do good work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

331
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:48,329
at a lot of cons especially in this area

332
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:51,840
I've run into a couple of their members

333
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:55,530
all over the place but yeah they're

334
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:58,620
definitely out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there as well so start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

335
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:02,520
life journey is they mapped out probably

336
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:04,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 infosec professions excuse me</font>

337
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,810
not that many in infosec but a bunch of

338
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,939
professions and mapped out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps you</font>

339
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:14,300
need to take and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources you need</font>

340
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:16,980
to learn from to get to that role

341
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:19,319
obviously asking someone in infosec to

342
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,210
be your mentor is out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's</font>

343
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,270
been a number of open offers for that

344
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:26,640
type of thing one<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter there's not</font>

345
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:29,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">really a structured program through some</font>

346
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,710
of the colleges there are but it can be

347
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,660
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> someone and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also as</font>

348
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:36,510
a mentor kind of advertising and it's

349
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,510
awkward there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of us who will</font>

350
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:42,660
just post out hey anyone want to mentor

351
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:45,810
ping me on<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter myself and good buddy</font>

352
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:49,920
of mine da 667 do that regularly but

353
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:51,510
there aren't too many that do and it's

354
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">not easy to be a mentor take some</font>

355
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:57,750
learning as well there's a group called

356
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:00,450
cyber fed which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely not what</font>

357
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:02,660
it sounds like they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

358
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:06,900
cyber security competition<font color="#E5E5E5"> Federation</font>

359
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:11,579
this was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on an NSF grant to</font>

360
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:14,070
build out availability for information

361
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:16,530
about infrared security challenges so

362
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:19,079
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea was to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> try to link up the</font>

363
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:22,619
challenge authors with the academic

364
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:24,240
community and with industry to help make

365
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:26,579
the challenges more structured more

366
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,670
uniform<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of still in its</font>

367
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:32,310
infancy there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting</font>

00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:35,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">podcast they're doing for that head by a</font>

371
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,570
kind of an interesting thing I think

372
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've done 30 or so up</font>

373
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:50,159
every every college student and I think

374
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:53,100
high school students might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> eligible</font>

375
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,320
for this for what as well or can get a

376
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,889
free count on dreamspark which gives you

377
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:01,500
access to a ton<font color="#E5E5E5"> of software through</font>

378
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,960
academic licensing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft this</font>

379
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,930
allows you to set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Windows Server</font>

380
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,710
and play with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it something that</font>

381
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,050
traditionally you wouldn't think to do

382
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:12,150
but is really really important if you

383
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,560
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working with servers well</font>

384
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,270
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use them until</font>

385
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,490
you've set one up until you played with

386
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:20,580
it getting their hands on experience is

387
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:23,160
very critical to IT in general and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

388
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:26,250
infosec so going out and playing with

389
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:29,340
that a lot of colleges also have labs

390
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:32,220
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> nyu-poly was just one example</font>

391
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:35,040
but most colleges with<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec programs</font>

392
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,080
have labs their various groups that meet

393
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,530
up from those a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of them are open to</font>

394
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,879
the public you just have to go find them

395
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:47,580
some of them are easier to find than

396
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:50,940
others so we get to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the crux of</font>

397
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:53,490
things the big<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue and as I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned</font>

398
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,830
before I know the big struggle that a

399
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:58,350
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of academia and that a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

400
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:02,490
programs<font color="#CCCCCC"> have is that they need help</font>

401
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:06,959
from professionals to say hey I'm

402
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:09,320
willing to do a presentation on X same

403
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,380
is true of meetup groups hackerspaces

404
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:17,040
colleges high school programs they all

405
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:20,520
are really looking for help a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

406
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,550
programs out there are always struggle

407
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,410
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find professionals come in and speak</font>

408
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:28,649
ideally all those college club meetings

409
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:30,030
will meet weekly or monthly or show

410
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,400
sometimes even month late but that's

411
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:35,129
normally more rare because they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

412
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,660
time at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point and they need</font>

speakers to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come in and talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

they're pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> an expert in at some</font>

417

level<font color="#E5E5E5"> or at least know well enough to</font>

00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:25,030
and meet up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all over the place take</font>

431
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:28,480
a look please get involved the pipeline

432
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:31,899
that we have right now is very broken

433
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,300
and we're just starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build out</font>

434
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,670
those resources to fix it more people

435
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,649
are starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build out programs</font>

436
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,970
around learning all those various skills

437
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:43,150
that I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the very</font>

438
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:47,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">beginning the skills that you need for</font>

439
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:50,830
the lovely job titles again this wants

440
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:56,370
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be angry and not friendly I hate</font>

441
00:20:50,830 --> 00:21:00,159
PowerPoint some days what is going on so

442
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:03,419
anyway as we go through those lovely

443
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:07,570
fields most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them do not have</font>

444
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:10,030
structured training so another way if

445
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:12,040
you're not say the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is</font>

446
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:15,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">comfortable speaking in front of a group</font>

447
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,750
as seen by Heidi this morning some

448
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,790
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> really struggle with that</font>

449
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:23,380
although she did an awesome job you

450
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:25,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">could see panic for those folks there's</font>

451
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,370
opportunities still out there so for

452
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:30,940
example the UMBC github that i<font color="#E5E5E5"> posted</font>

453
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:34,510
earlier re room sorry um you see as well

454
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:37,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">as my own the project is to try to build</font>

455
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:40,660
out labs for something that I do<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font>

456
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:43,000
regular basis<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for example taking a</font>

457
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:46,020
look at a pcap and looking at a

458
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,460
particular type of event researching it

459
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:51,629
literally as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go through my daily job</font>

460
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:55,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm documenting this is what I did</font>

461
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:58,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">although with non work data I go home</font>

462
00:21:55,170 --> 00:22:01,020
I'm in the process of taking an entire

463
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:03,669
analysis of an intrusion event and

464
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:07,600
running through the process told by tool

465
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:10,419
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my home lab and writing out the steps</font>

466
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,178
of what needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be done and the answers</font>

467
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:15,850
and separating that out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what the</font>

468
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:18,789
universities need a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the professor</font>

469
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:20,918
struggle because they'll have some

470
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:22,779
experience but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to have</font>

471
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:25,929
experience in everywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> in infosec a</font>

472
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:28,210
lot of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> programs are taught by</font>

473
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:30,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">teachers who may have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some experience in</font>

474
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:34,629
one spot but not necessarily another

475
00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:37,268
even my college where every every

476
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:40,029
high-end class every 300 400 level class

477
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:42,820
the teacher was actually in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry</font>

478
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:46,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">full-time and teaching part-time they</font>

479
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:47,950
except for I think two or three every

480
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,899
teacher was actually in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry</font>

481
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,700
they still struggled with some of the

482
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:54,219
functional aspects of some of the

483
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:57,190
classes because things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

484
00:22:54,220 --> 00:23:00,850
wireless where do we start and again

485
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:03,970
what while I talked about that lovely

486
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:05,949
program or programs at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the high school</font>

487
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:08,440
middle school level is as those develop

488
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:10,989
what we can expect when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start</font>

489
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,929
college can we can start to raise<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

490
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:15,850
bar so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example at CCDC collegiate</font>

491
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:17,919
cyber defense competition every year

492
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:20,259
people get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

493
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">more experience so by the time they</font>

00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:24,909
enter the challenge or by the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

cyber security experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they're</font>

497
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:31,600
moving on to more advanced things so

498
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:35,529
you're gonna start to see more advanced

499
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,259
folks as you come in and entering groups

500
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:40,419
so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you build up that pipeline the</font>

501

skills starting from middle school by

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time they hit high school they're a</font>

503
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:47,980
lot higher level than just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use a lance</font>

504
00:23:45,129 --> 00:23:50,949
messenger nowadays snapchat and Twitter

00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:53,019
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what not to oh yeah I've</font>

506
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,929
participated in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber security defense</font>

507
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:57,730
of exercise when high-schoolers are

508
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:59,739
starting to do that by the time they hit

509
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,600
college will<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've done five or six of</font>

00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:03,700
these now i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to play the college</font>

fun and providing a more more

514
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:16,779
challenging attacker so as the skills at

school<font color="#CCCCCC"> high school college and industry</font>

517
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:23,779
levels up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire industry is going</font>

518
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:27,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">to build but to get</font>

519
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:29,710
there we need everybody's help to go out

520
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:32,749
and start building<font color="#CCCCCC"> up those programs</font>

521
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:34,210
building up the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> generation exactly</font>

522
00:24:32,749 --> 00:24:37,609
what Heidi talked about this morning

523
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:40,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem that we're having we</font>

524
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:42,408
need your assistance I say we I'm out

525
00:24:40,249 --> 00:24:46,820
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> too I just volunteer with a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

526
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:51,460
stuff so now I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> ranted for a few</font>

527
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:51,460
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> does anyone have any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

528
00:24:51,729 --> 00:25:05,210
no that's fun yes so in general<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

529
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:07,940
much every aspect of building the

530
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:10,849
infosec pipeline needs help so that's

531
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:13,960
the github groups that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

532
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:15,979
write labs and create courseware that's

533
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,080
volunteers to actually teach at

534
00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:20,719
universities and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot and community</font>

535
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,109
colleges high schools on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> side so for</font>

536
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:26,149
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> part time that's volunteering to</font>

537
00:25:24,109 --> 00:25:30,129
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber security clubs and speaking</font>

538
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:32,629
there or at local meetups that's mentors

539
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:37,189
for all of those groups and new

540
00:25:32,629 --> 00:25:39,978
professionals that's everything there's

541
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:43,369
a shortage all<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the board which is</font>

542
00:25:39,979 --> 00:25:45,830
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the problem and again there's a</font>

543
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:49,009
few folks trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you're starting to</font>

544
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:52,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">build up on that but we need the</font>

545
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:55,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">community's assistance because there's a</font>

546
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,080
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of students out there and the number</font>

547
00:25:55,219 --> 00:26:00,619
of mentors versus the number of people

548
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:03,589
who need mentorship is a huge disparity

549
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:06,619
I can't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 mentors or 20 mentees</font>

550
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:07,940
rather also<font color="#CCCCCC"> just because you have a</font>

551
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:10,039
mentee doesn't mean you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

552
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,559
mentor as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well there are some high</font>

553
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:13,969
school students who were mentoring some

554
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,489
middle school students who are also

555
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:19,309
receiving some mentorship from college

556
00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:21,859
students through the cyber<font color="#E5E5E5"> Patriot</font>

557
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:25,279
program they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually asked for every</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">single team they want a mentor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who has</font>

559
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,479
some experience in some cases this was

560
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,879
his college students who had played

561
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:35,119
challenges in others who it was folks in

562
00:26:31,879 --> 00:26:36,678
the industry but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a team that</font>

563
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,678
iron up mentoring

564
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:43,820
and when they started playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had</font>

565
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,860
10 people by the time the organizer of

566
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:48,950
cyber Patriot linked me up with them

567
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:50,990
about two months later they were down to

568
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:53,720
four people because they didn't have

569
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:56,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">that mentorship and they struggled with</font>

570
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,830
just slides just explaining what's the

571

difference between a threaten of

572

vulnerability and the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> basic of</font>

play the next year the problem is right

now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not giving them the</font>

encouragement we need to get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

580
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:26,299
and assist whether that be volunteering

you're more comfortable with obviously

583
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:33,379
it said but some folks aren't

584
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:35,960
comfortable public speaking not a big

585
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:38,928
deal you can still assist there's still

586
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,149
tons of programs collegiate cyber

587
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:45,230
defense competition for example uses

588
00:27:41,149 --> 00:27:47,678
volunteers as judges as the folks who

are on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the infrastructure excuse me</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and defend a network that they knew</font>

595
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,119
nothing about walking in besides these

596
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:07,759
are the operating systems and the base

597
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:10,459
function of what I have so they may get

598

told you have a 2003 server 2003

602
00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:24,860
luck so you can imagine that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind</font>

603
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:27,619
of a fun exercise very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pros</font>

make an SSL certificate and put that

620
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:07,519
the fun is you have a group of red

621
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:11,529
teamers including folks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> musics rub</font>

00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:22,789
who are working to gain access and

<font color="#CCCCCC">control of the student networks and</font>

disable them at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> point normally they</font>

628
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:29,499
spend the first day having some fun

629
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:32,839
first and playing around establishing

630
00:29:29,499 --> 00:29:35,239
persistent seven ways from Sunday but

631
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:37,869
now depending on what strategy the red

632
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:41,599
team uses can change the exercise

633
00:29:37,869 --> 00:29:43,158
realistically the red teamers are always

634
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:44,989
have a good bit of advantage they get to

635
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:47,509
bring in their own tools they get to

636
00:29:44,989 --> 00:29:50,330
prepare and stacked overwhelmingly

637
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:52,609
against the student spot the students

638
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:55,239
get to learn in an environment that I

639
00:29:52,609 --> 00:29:57,468
would still love to play in today of

640
00:29:55,239 --> 00:30:00,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">inherit and defend a network where the</font>

645
00:30:08,869 --> 00:30:13,428
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> competition or struggling is much</font>

646
00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:15,498
easier on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> flipside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they also are</font>

647
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:18,379

opportunities internships which all the

649
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:22,849
sponsors the exercise end up hiring

650
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:27,289
those students because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that</font>

651
00:30:22,849 --> 00:30:31,189
experience and have shown<font color="#CCCCCC"> interest the</font>

of cyber security challenges are looking

for the students are participating and

655
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:40,489
saying you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really are dedicated to this</font>

656
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:44,239
field you really have this extra

657
00:30:40,489 --> 00:30:45,769
interest and you were showing up you're

658
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:49,460
showing up to something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">required to and enjoying it maybe you're</font>

660
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:55,779
the right kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> person in infosec I</font>

661
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:58,909
would rather hire someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who has it</font>

662
00:30:55,779 --> 00:31:01,089
enthusiasm then I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone with a</font>

663
00:30:58,909 --> 00:31:03,840
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more experience any day</font>

664
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:05,010
person with enthusiasm will surpass the

665
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,549
person with a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of more</font>

666
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:10,590
experience quickly this is a constantly

667
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:13,440
changing field we are in a treadmill if

668
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:16,799
you stop you're falling further behind

669
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,260
if you're not running fast enough you

670
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,330
there is no fast enough you always run a

671
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,520
little bit behind because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

672
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:26,340
much depth and breadth<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this field</font>

673
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:29,370
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to learn</font>

674
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:31,500
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this field I would say</font>

675
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:33,870
it's a struggle to call yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

676
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:36,149
expert in a particular in more than one

677
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:38,969
discipline in infosec because there's

678
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:41,639
that much going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in every individual</font>

679
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:44,070
field there's constantly things going on

680
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,260
the reason why so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us use twitter</font>

681
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:49,439
is for that exact reason because the

682
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:50,879
news that we see you hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a breach</font>

683
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,029
you hear about the newest exploit

684
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,809
technique the newest defensive tool and

685
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:56,789
sometimes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't even know they're</font>

686
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:58,260
there until they've been around for a

687
00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:00,720
number of years and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you happen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

688
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,429
into them an event or happen to find

689
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,309
someone's blog<font color="#CCCCCC"> posts that explains</font>

690
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:07,320
exactly what you need which is probably

691
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:09,418
more common than finding in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> text book</font>

692
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't think I've found too many</font>

693
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:14,070
structured things that I had a research

694
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:17,000
question then it up in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> textbook it's</font>

695
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:19,799
pretty much always someone's blog or

696
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,510
asking on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter and someone says hey I</font>

697
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:24,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrote a blog post on that two years ago</font>

698
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:26,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">here you go and that's honestly one of</font>

699
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,059
the best ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find answer stack</font>

700
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:32,580
overflow is another same type of

701
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:35,789
response and communication only more in

702
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:41,549
a forum aspect of you know who looking

703
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:44,820
at that so what we have is a serious

704
00:32:41,549 --> 00:32:47,580
need for your assistance so please take

705
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:49,950
the opportunity in your area look for

706
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:51,960
the groups that are out there get

707
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:53,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved in what you can if you don't</font>

708
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,950
want to do it in person<font color="#E5E5E5"> go online</font>

709
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:58,520
there's opportunities there yes you had

710
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,520
a question the back

711
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:21,610
so every hacker space is pretty much

712
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:24,370
unique in a way some have more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

maker focus some are more into

00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:30,489
electronics microcontrollers programming

715
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:32,410
you start to get fewer and fewer and as

716
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:35,350
you approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec there are still a</font>

717
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:37,890
few out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one I</font>

00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:46,000
professionals pretty much every person

722
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,210
field so periodically will have events

723
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:54,040
like of we have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> event called the</font>

726
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:02,010
and I've had everything from writing my

729
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:11,409
knife and axe throwing because that's

730
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:15,820
the diversity in the technology

731
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:20,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">community at its</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> core the hackerspace</font>

734
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:28,479
one given the diversity we have in

735
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:30,219
technology that can be all over the

736
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,440
spectrum and depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on which one you</font>

737
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:36,879
participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some will have a lot more</font>

738
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:38,650
info SEC IT<font color="#E5E5E5"> some won't find one that if</font>

739
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,030
there's one excuse me<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're lucky</font>

740
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:42,660
enough to find one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> does in your</font>

741
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:45,730
area then it's a great opportunity

742
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:48,879
sometimes just exposing different

743
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:53,620
technologists to information security

744
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:56,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">things they don't realize we host a lot</font>

745
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:58,990
of other info SEC meetups so wass

746
00:34:56,739 --> 00:35:01,390
Maryland has come to my hacker space

747
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:04,390
participated similarly at colleges

748
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:08,859
sometimes they will host say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh wasp or</font>

749
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:11,890
other info SEC related groups so it just

750
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:15,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of depends on figuring out the</font>

751
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:19,109
right thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your area especially in</font>

752
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:19,109
the maryland DC<font color="#CCCCCC"> Virginia area there are</font>

753
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:24,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">seemingly infinite amount of groups to</font>

754
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the point where you can't view them all</font>

755
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,390
you

756
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:32,810
literally there are more groups every

757
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:38,140
night then there are in certain area so

758
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:38,140
it's kind of a struggle yes yep yep

759
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:49,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's ones that cover just about</font>

760
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:52,130
everything on meetup com is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> popular</font>

761
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:55,460
and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of groups will cross-pollinate</font>

762
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:58,340
so for example you'll find people who

763
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:00,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">are in multiple groups and sometimes</font>

764
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:02,180
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can lead to interesting discussions</font>

765
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:04,610
and you realize hey wait you're into all

766
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:08,450
the things I'm into that's kind of

767
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:12,100
interesting let's talk given to some

768
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:14,870
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversations with that</font>

769
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:18,470
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different opportunities</font>

770
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:21,290
here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hope you guys go out</font>

771
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:23,500
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into them even if you</font>

772
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:26,000
can't contribute in person any

773
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:29,510
contributions you make virtual<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

774
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,120
person make the offer it's also a great

775
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:33,740
way to get interns because when your

776
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">company wants to go get an intern when</font>

777
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,220
you say well I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone who's</font>

778
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:40,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">really dedicated who asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me to be</font>

779
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,689
their mentor and you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'd</font>

780
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,759
be a perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> fit for this mentorship</font>

781
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:45,740
program you've already vetted the person

782
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,380
you already<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they have an interest</font>

783
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:50,629
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> already know what their skills are</font>

784
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:52,580
that saves a lot of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and money on</font>

785
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:54,950
companies when you think about the cost

786
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:57,380
of sourcing someone well you don't think

787
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:58,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">of an intern is necessarily someone</font>

788
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,610
you're going to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ton of time on</font>

789
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,920
but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think about all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

790
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:06,170
you spend interviewing 20 candidates

791
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,780
even if that's half an hour piece that's

792
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:10,970
10 hours you could have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working so</font>

793
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:15,010
realistically there's a cost to finding

794
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:17,779
a good intern and they become typically

795
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:20,480
inexpensive employees<font color="#E5E5E5"> after if you if</font>

796
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:22,910
the organization likes them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

797
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">great way to actually pick good interns</font>

798
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:29,390
and get them into excellent position so

799
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:30,950
that helps everybody because companies

800
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:37,730
like it when you have an intern that

801
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:40,609
works out<font color="#E5E5E5"> well any other questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

802
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:46,130

804
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,420
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be building up the list of</font>

805
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:53,600
information i'm also going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> posting</font>

806
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:56,000
these slides online the other kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of co</font>

807
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,650
purpose to this is when you find that

<font color="#E5E5E5">person who asks you what are the</font>

resources that are available now<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>
