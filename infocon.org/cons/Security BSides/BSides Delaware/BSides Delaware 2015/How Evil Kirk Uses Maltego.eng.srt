00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,610
how evil curved uses multi go it's my

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,590
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first time I've ever even</font>

5
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,150
been to a security conference level of

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:33,640
speaking in front of much people so a

7
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:38,410
little nervous sorry but uh next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font>

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:41,020
here Who am I my name is Robert<font color="#E5E5E5"> McMahon</font>

9
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,819
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> started off in the IT industry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

10
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> desk of many people were to</font>

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:48,670
JPMorgan Chase for three years helping

12
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:50,440
people turn on and off the printers and

13
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,210
then I got picked up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a mentor at</font>

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,390
tech skills which is a trade school so I

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,390
hope

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:03,589
and without this area<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so I</font>

17
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:09,759
looked a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people get IT</font>

18
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:09,759
certifications I think so help desk

19
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,169
stay

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,200
all right and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a mentor there for</font>

21
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:23,030
about three years and it was a school

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,040
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was mostly for people like us we</font>

23
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">just want to pick up certification to</font>

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,680
get better and to get a better company

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:33,679
after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lucky and I got</font>

26
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,930
in at eps financial as a just a junior

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,840
software developer i got in at the

28
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,040
bottom floor there I<font color="#E5E5E5"> helped them build</font>

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,180
their entire photo dates for the whole

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,310
company so it's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good experience</font>

31
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">starting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the bottom we built the</font>

32
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,820
design a database built it from the

33
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,340
ground up and it's not some experience

34
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,779
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently they needed to get pci</font>

35
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,760
to fight and they knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was in the</font>

36
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,100
security and they

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:59,500
to be there information security analyst

38
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,500
so that's my history

39
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,729
and I wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be here today if it</font>

40
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,399
wasn't for leather coat right love you

41
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,478
Brian and anything that goes wrong in

42
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,479
this I blame on

43
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,970
alright so there's really two things

44
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,519
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about today one</font>

45
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:25,069
is a local transform API written and

46
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,120
Donette for multi go and then the main

47
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:28,040
thing that most of you are probably

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,750
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the transforms to</font>

49
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,150
enumerate information from inside a

50
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:36,040
Windows domain so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start off</font>

51
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,040
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the API and on it</font>

52
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:46,600
it's just it's written in C sharp there

53
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:49,239
was when i was when i was using multi go

54
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,480
and i noticed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's there's api's</font>

55
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,600
out there for PHP there's one for<font color="#CCCCCC"> python</font>

56
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think there's one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for see as well but</font>

57
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,060
i really like c-sharp that's my main

58
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:07,000
codes my main language so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just why not</font>

59
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:10,209
write an<font color="#E5E5E5"> API so I guess the first thing</font>

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,850
I'm going to show you the code to using

61
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:14,800
this API to find the robot stop txt this

62
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,170
finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> robots.txt to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me it's kind of</font>

63
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,060
like the world of multi go transforms

64
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:23,488
basic people are you all familiar with

65
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,489
multi<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and transforms</font>

66
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:35,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so with this API I will go into</font>

67
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,480
the into the internal code of the API

68
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,269
because we'll be here forever but just

69
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,980
the general overview of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it</font>

70
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:44,230
you always start off by creating a multi

71
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,189
no response generator object and that's

72
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,399
what everything is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go into</font>

73
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:50,170
you're going to add different entities

74
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,819
like a phrase entity or

75
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,040
website or whatever you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add</font>

76
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:56,619
when you're doing here your life so this

77
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,280
one we want to find the<font color="#E5E5E5"> robots.txt ma</font>

78
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,280
website

79
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:08,220
so when

80
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,220
also

81
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:24,460
area alright so when multi go passes in

82
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:26,139
an entity from the from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the palette</font>

83
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,758
there's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be two arguments the</font>

84
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:31,210
first argument<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be the enemy</font>

85
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,979
value so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll fire up on table in a</font>

86
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:36,549
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> website for example</font>

87
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:38,680
it would be wwe.com people's past your

88
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:43,240
first argument your second argument is

89
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:46,659
any special values or extra values that

90
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:49,449
are on there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's field name equals</font>

91
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:55,300
field value field<font color="#E5E5E5"> two equals feel to</font>

92
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:58,449
value and it's separated by a separated

93
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,849
by a hash pound sharp symbol whatever

94
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:02,199
you want to call that in this case and

95
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:04,628
in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases you're only going to use</font>

96
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,690
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first argument to to do your work on</font>

97
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:09,210
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases you might use the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other ones</font>

98
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:12,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">but in this case we're only going to use</font>

99
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:15,008
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> argument so the first thing I</font>

100
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:17,530
have here is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a demonstration of how</font>

101
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:19,270
to add a simple UI message that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

102
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:23,559
show up in all you in the bottom so you

103
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:25,359
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> debug or to show any messages to the</font>

104
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,409
user at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom there you just</font>

105
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">passing you by message type</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tivo'd</font>

106
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:31,339
and in this case that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will just pass it</font>

107
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:35,689
whatever website gets passed through to

108
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:39,439
the application<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then here I'm</font>

109
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:42,439
building the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URI to get to the</font>

110
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:45,319
robots.txt file I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> hathcock combined</font>

111
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:47,239
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I decided to try this way using URI</font>

112
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,599
objects and it works really well and

113
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:52,609
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps just build the URI to patch</font>

114
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:55,998
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> load the website to actually get the</font>

115
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:58,369
robots.txt fun sit down here just use

116
00:05:55,999 --> 00:06:01,969
web client download stream from the

117
00:05:58,369 --> 00:06:04,489
robots.txt file and then for each line

118
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:08,959
in the robots.txt file so each entry

119
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:11,628
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add a phrase in d2</font>

120
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,939
multi-code<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then here we have our</font>

121
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:16,759
caches so if there's like a 404 for

122
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:18,379
example over 500 error we're gonna the

123
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,419
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a partial error if there's</font>

124
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,889
some other exception for your show fatal

125
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:23,979
error

126
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:26,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the message in nature and then at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

127
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:29,620
end of every program you can consult our

128
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,569
a line get a multi<font color="#CCCCCC"> go message</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you get</font>

129
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:36,370
multi go message text and that just see

130
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:38,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">realises the object just see realises</font>

the object into an<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML object so all the</font>

132
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:43,270
XML is done for you you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

133
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,758
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> your XML is properly from your</font>

135
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,150
reception when it gets back to multi<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

136
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:53,378
so it's actually I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a demo</font>

137
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,799
but I'm afraid to connect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> live</font>

138
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,800
finder

139
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,870
we'll see

140
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:14,759
does anybody know SC

141
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,830
see capital<font color="#CCCCCC"> T</font>

142
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,020
cui

143
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,500
that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> fearful</font>

144
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,220
all right I'm gonna try two more time

145
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,930
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was hoping to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but I</font>

146
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:35,919
use that demo gods<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't living today</font>

147
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:37,779
but basically to do it

148
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,309
you usually have something other like

149
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:42,969
you start off<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a domain and you run</font>

150
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:44,560
a level-3 level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 machine on and to get</font>

151
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:48,100
all this information from it we

152
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,709
eventually get to a website right click

153
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,750
it do get robots this isn't going to

154
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:54,729
work because I'm not connected but you

155
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the picture and then it will give</font>

156
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,610
you back to separate phrase entity so it

157
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:59,610
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> look something like this</font>

158
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:19,930
area sort of a separate phrase for

159
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,839
Oh

160
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,910
soooo get the picture

161
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,330
alright so let's go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next part</font>

162
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:44,040
that's just the API something really

163
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:46,320
easy to use that you can use C sharp

164
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,480
code to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make things with multi-goal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

165
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,280
you can write your own logic using<font color="#E5E5E5"> C</font>

166
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,280
sharp and using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Olympus libraries</font>

167
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:24,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright</font>

168
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,050
the fun part

169
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,680
the internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> transforms so</font>

170
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:41,020
there's a series of new entities that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

171
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,390
created<font color="#CCCCCC"> for multi go specifically for</font>

172
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:46,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">internal components so you have your</font>

173
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:50,010
domain which represents the internal

174
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:52,710
or whatever your<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is there are</font>

175
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,060
computers represent computers<font color="#E5E5E5"> rotation</font>

176
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,540
servers any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of device in your</font>

177
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,849
inside the domain distribution groups

178
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,490
and security groups just<font color="#CCCCCC"> rumors inside</font>

179
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:06,060
your domain user accounts obviously user

180
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:08,250
accounts email delegates and email read

181
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">I could have named that better but the</font>

182
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,320
email delegate is an account that can

183
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:15,450
send email on behalf of another person

184
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,490
so if i can send they usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

185
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:20,880
like a sales department somebody can

186
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,380
send sales at your company com then

187
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,230
email read is something that has full

188
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,550
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to another user's email these are</font>

189
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,200
just this just the beginning of them

190
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,839
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a lot more in the</font>

191
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,220
future this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not completely done</font>

192
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,370
there's actually a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can really</font>

193
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,320
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done with these internal source or</font>

194
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:40,180
target it's that like shoveling jealous

195
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,800
which is really fun

196
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:45,829
and then the new transforms themselves

197
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,229
there's there are domain transforms

198
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:50,239
which find computers they find<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

199
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:53,060
users in the domain groups in the domain

200
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,259
security room situation groups group

201
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,329
transforms<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you can run on these</font>

202
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:58,699
groups so they find members of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

203
00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:02,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">group's subgroups of that group things</font>

204
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:03,800
like that user<font color="#E5E5E5"> transforms so you can</font>

205
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:06,230
find the user's email address phone

206
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,149
numbers groups that they're in as well

207
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:10,910
and computer transforms which you can do

208
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:12,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like shovel she'll find user</font>

209
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,870
accounts that<font color="#CCCCCC"> log</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into that computer</font>

210
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:17,810
find the operating system the patch

211
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:20,170
level and it's currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> on fun things</font>

212
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that</font>

213
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,350
and actually I'm not going to use this

214
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,300
slide I'm actually in England

215
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,300
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've written more code</font>

216
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:44,840
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a massive switch for</font>

217
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,050
the main argument that comes in first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

218
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:50,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">all I guess we'll go into how we add</font>

219
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,709
these into

220
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,689
maybe not

221
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:35,549
three that will just go rates

222
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:37,799
alright so these are the transforms<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

223
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:40,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have done so far and there's a lot</font>

224
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:42,540
more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if any of you want to jump in</font>

225
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:45,089
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do some development as well just let</font>

226
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,319
me know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the email or see me</font>

227
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:48,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">after the conference because there's a</font>

228
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:50,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot more than we've done with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this this</font>

229
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:53,609
can really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that we need to take</font>

230
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,079
multi go and turn it into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost we're</font>

231
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:56,910
going to laugh at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing but turn it</font>

232
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:59,248
into like an arbitrage where you can do

233
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,079
a lot of you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> automate a lot of your</font>

234
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:06,689
internal penetration testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

235
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:07,919
through multi tool itself so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

236
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:09,480
the these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the transforms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that have</font>

237
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,009
been done so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far and there's a lot more</font>

238
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,949
and I'm probably going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of</font>

239
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:15,959
this March switch statement that's

240
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:23,040
pretty large of notice on some open

241
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:24,430
closed model later on these transforms

242
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,300
is something

243
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:31,939
you yeah what you what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you can</font>

244
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,560
get the code from my bitbucket account

245
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:37,760
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll have they'll be on one of the</font>

246
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:40,640
later sides but up you import them into

247
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,410
multi go and you just use a good cry<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

248
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the shelf yet and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you guys</font>

249
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:47,209
how to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't i don't have that</font>

250
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,819
in the presentation but if anybody wants

251
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:51,350
to if anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't know how to import</font>

252
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:56,420
things in the mall tango let me know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

253
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:58,490
i'll i'll show you how<font color="#CCCCCC"> people so you're</font>

254
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,740
the first thing is internal between two

255
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:03,110
computers this just gets all of the

256
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,750
computers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in the domain and</font>

257
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,450
this is run from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the standpoint of any</font>

258
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:11,060
domain user so if you pop a box inside

259
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:13,250
of a domain and your lower<font color="#E5E5E5"> level user as</font>

260
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,750
long as that user can see these

261
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,870
computers in the domain as long as they

262
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:19,310
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact the domain controller you</font>

263
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:22,160
can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so you don't have to be</font>

264
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:25,719
domain ID and our local admin even this

265
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">is equivalent of like when you open up</font>

266
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:31,580
outlook and you're searching for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a user</font>

267
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,170
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's anybody that can see these you</font>

268
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,970
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don to be domain</font>

269
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,920
admin you do have to be on a machine

270
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,590
inside than ever so it's going to be

271
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,300
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> by pen testers that get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into a</font>

272
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:44,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">network or read you sit at my work to</font>

273
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,800
help root out people that were in groups

274
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:49,880
that should have been an intruder like

275
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">we forgot about it so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first one is</font>

276
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,260
internal the media computer supplies all

277
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,390
the computers inside a domain the second

278
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,069
one is internal delete to all groups so

279
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,990
find all of the security groups and all

280
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,850
the distribution groups and that domain

281
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,940
and puts them on the graph for you very

282
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,890
nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and equal then there's separate</font>

283
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,090
ones for just security groups and just

284
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,480
distribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> groups if you're just</font>

285
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:13,760
interested in those<font color="#E5E5E5"> different groups</font>

286
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,380
internal domain users that gets all of

287
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,670
the users in the domain or all of the

288
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,980
users that you can see the domain and

289
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:21,319
puts them out there on the graph for you

290
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:24,200
and then group<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 member groups all the</font>

291
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,770
subgroups inside the inside of group so

292
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,570
once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I usually start off with doing</font>

293
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:31,579
internal donated computers and internal

294
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,470
deletes all groups and then highlighting

295
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:37,510
all the groups and running

296
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:39,880
group<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> users so you get all the users</font>

297
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:43,090
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> groups and it was great group to</font>

298
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:46,540
member groups that's any groups that are

299
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:48,310
inside that group so if you have any

300
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:54,250
chart group and then you have HR admin

301
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:55,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">versus HR employees or HR 10 reps group</font>

302
00:16:54,250 --> 00:17:00,040
to users can tell the users inside that

303
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,840
group user to all groups and user to

304
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,629
distribution groups and using security

305
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,400
gears these are just to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use the</font>

306
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">groups that the user in so if you start</font>

307
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,060
off with just getting users that you

308
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:14,080
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go kind of backwards you can do</font>

309
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:16,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">that user to email addresses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

310
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:20,619
you all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the email addresses of that user</font>

311
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:22,030
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> better assigns that user user two</font>

312
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:23,859
phone numbers you can find the phone

313
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,810
numbers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are assigned to that user</font>

314
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:28,719
and this is just in the domain so like

315
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:30,129
in my domain for example we don't store

316
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,700
that in active directory so you won't

317
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:34,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">see that button something to you go</font>

318
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,860
internal the way the email<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses</font>

319
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:39,250
this just gets all the email addresses

320
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the domain so if you want if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

321
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,540
to do something later on social

322
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">engineering travel these email addresses</font>

323
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,049
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can export</font>

324
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:53,629
to an excel file in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way you know</font>

325
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:57,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">you said user the email read that takes</font>

326
00:17:53,629 --> 00:17:59,719
a user as the input and then any email

327
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:01,519
detik that that user has access to them

328
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,809
that user conveyed so the forms email

329
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:07,369
the sales email box anything that they

330
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:09,889
agreed that's going to spit that out to

331
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:13,699
you the delegates that's anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

332
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:15,559
the user can send<font color="#CCCCCC"> emails to so the sales</font>

333
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:20,419
user for example can send sales in your

computer and computers is where I'm

338
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,210

into this you can give that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an input</font>

361
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you just have it go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to each machine</font>

362
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,730
it just asking to machine a show pony

363
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:33,170

366
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:43,059
have to be enjoy machine I i put the

367
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:46,550

00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:56,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">a sample one but you put it into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the app</font>

371
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,200
config file and that's that's like if

372

00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,030
up the box or you have a user that's

380
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,040
authenticate on that don't mean I

381
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:20,070
haven't what you need to install ball to

382
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:22,139

383
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:24,060
solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> aunty go I intentionally made this</font>

384
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:28,490
towards just one executable you have to

385
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:28,490
drop so that way

386
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,419
hi

387
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,178
it's a large name you can rename it if

388
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,770
you want to wait I intentionally made it

389
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:49,190
to where it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one executable you</font>

390
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:51,230
can drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a machine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> menopause or</font>

391
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:54,020
whatever and then it will spit out the

392
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:56,179
last thing that I just spits out the the

393
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">XML that you can import it'll take you</font>

394
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:59,480
later so you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to you don't</font>

395
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:03,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to set up multi go on the inside of</font>

396
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,150
a network<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can just move this</font>

397
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:08,320
executable file there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you</font>

398
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,320
the command line arguments

399
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:18,250
yes the the binary execute runs all your

400
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:22,120
demands how puts it into multi go<font color="#CCCCCC"> xml</font>

401
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:24,730
yes yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi go leads the it just</font>

402
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:30,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">reads standard out so that's how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

403
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:33,880
that how you get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> xml back to you</font>

404
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:37,149
in a penetration test our next one sort

405
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,529
of tsunami today how<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you going to</font>

406
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:40,658
get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know back to you in something</font>

407
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:42,940
automatically or it depends on how you

408
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:45,250
got the shell so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you just have</font>

409
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,710
just a regular command shell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

410
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:50,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">upload this and you can run the</font>

411
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:53,180
transport copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and paste it back and</font>

412
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,729
then put it into a

413
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:58,370
just it's just dot XML file and you can

414
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:02,560
import that into multi<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can look</font>

415
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,560
at it look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice pretty grounded</font>

416
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:25,580
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just go through like we're</font>

417
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:32,150
adding a new one so say we're adding one

418
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:33,530
for internal domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so you go up</font>

419
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,470
here if you want to add the transform

420
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:41,629
now this you'll be able to import this

421
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:42,980
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> by bitbucket account you should be</font>

422
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:45,050
able to just import this right and so

423
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,940
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to go through and add all</font>

424
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:49,040
these locally but just to give you an

425
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,510
idea about the arguments for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the for the</font>

426
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:54,470
application we're just going to use it

427
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:57,790
from landline this will give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you some</font>

428
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,790
insight into that so

429
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:07,160
user accounts

430
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:15,479
the input entity type the domain

431
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:30,179
you're using this just for the main

432
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:34,480
accident stupid can you get use that

433
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:38,320
idea to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a party</font>

434
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,299
this is what would you need this would

435
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">be done from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the standpoint as you're</font>

436
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:44,860
already in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> network so either either</font>

437
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're you're an admin on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

438
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:49,389
and you want to get more<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

439
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:51,428
about your own network or you just love

440
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:54,400
the box inside the network and you this

441
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:56,410
is so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can quickly find other</font>

442
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,450
machines on that network instead of just

443
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:00,130
nmap scanning or like that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> n map</font>

444
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,530
can be pretty loud or doing something

445
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:05,350
else that might be picked up by an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ids</font>

446
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:07,270
IPS this is something that probably

447
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:08,649
wouldn't be picked up by that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

448
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,020
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all this information without</font>

449
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:13,510
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to do about things we want to</font>

450
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">produce it saying another network you</font>

451
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,950
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get permission</font>

452
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:22,410
correct yeah you have to be together

453
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:25,970
last night yeah yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so we had</font>

454
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,970
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> transform</font>

455
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,029
and in the parameters here

456
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">state you take them right out of the</font>

457
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,549
switch

458
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:47,300
so right here

459
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:49,460
this is the argument that you would pass

460
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,649
it so whatever transform you want to run

461
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:54,160
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pass it in an argument so if we</font>

462
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:57,610
wanted to do it's a user accounts

463
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,610
intervene to users

464
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:19,090
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> when multi go pulses is going to call</font>

465
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:20,980
it with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> N any value and then it's</font>

466
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:23,580
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call with I'm sorry it's going</font>

467
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,660
to call the executable file with the

468
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,250
transform that I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use so it's</font>

469
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,140
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> internal going to users and</font>

470
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,190
then you pass in the energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> less if</font>

471
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,050
you're calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> this from the command</font>

472
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:35,010
line they live up just like this you can

473
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:37,180
usually ignore this field1 field2 part

474
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:40,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're just going to be using for the</font>

475
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:42,760
most part just the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> argument so if</font>

476
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:46,990
your internal domain is be<font color="#CCCCCC"> sighs</font>

477
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:48,160
doubtful for example because you would

478
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:50,040
pass it if you're calling you from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

479
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:55,170
command line is a internal domain users

480
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:55,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">b-sides on local it all</font>

481
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,428
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a sample graph from a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

482
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:13,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to and this is from a</font>

483
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:16,549
limited user and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly</font>

484
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">immigrated all of the groups and then</font>

485
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:24,160
all of the users inside those groups

486
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:24,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">domain so is it</font>

487
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so the top part there that's</font>

488
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:34,379
just the domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just dragged on the</font>

489
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:37,000
domain typed in domain local and Randy

490
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:40,090
transformed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get all groups inside the</font>

491
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,040
domain all of these purple our security

492
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:44,500
groups the brown our distribution groups

493
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,120
and you cannot end the pink<font color="#E5E5E5"> our user</font>

494
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,340
account so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously tell that</font>

495
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:51,340
this one right here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just the user of</font>

496
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:54,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the built-in user account for domain and</font>

497
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:56,879
all of these are just users in there

498
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,810
each of these are separate security

499
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,250
group in the domain and you can tell

500
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:05,010
which user belongs to which<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

501
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,900
group so we use this in my company<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

502
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,910
help weed out we have a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

503
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come and go a lot of contractors</font>

504
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,300
that come and go and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> get left in</font>

505
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,820
groups that they shouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and</font>

506
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,680
there's all kinds of new groups that can

507
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,330
start up and have to delete oh so we

508
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,020
just use this periodically audit our

509
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:23,310
groups so it's that's kind of a non

510
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:26,400
pentesting way of using it or you can

511
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:27,840
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it up in a pen test and find all</font>

512
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,040
of the groups so you know like who's in

513
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,260
the domain additives or you can see

514
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,690
other groups that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have administrators at</font>

515
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:36,420
you want to get those accounts and try

516
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:40,700
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find them pop those so that's</font>

517
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">just--that's this is just a</font>

518
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:45,230
one example of something that you can

519
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,940
use this for to find and this dennis is

520
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">quick when I read this I wish I could</font>

521
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done a demonstration in here but I</font>

522
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:54,170
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have time to setup a domain an</font>

523
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,440
example domain but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was this took</font>

524
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:59,150
about five seconds to run so<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine if</font>

525
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're doing this without this tool and</font>

526
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,180
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> scanned all of the computers in the</font>

527
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,860
network you brought em back on

528
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:07,300
everything networking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will take</font>

529
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:11,330
anomalies development compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

530
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:13,370
this is kind of a more close-up you can

531
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,840
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was so that's just the</font>

532
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:16,310
standard user account the domain or the

533
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,409
standard user group and these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

534
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:20,450
the users that are really tied to any

535
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:26,040
other groups these you sort of are tied

536
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:28,640
to other groups and that was my<font color="#CCCCCC"> shells</font>

537
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,639
fun with that

538
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:34,170
that was that for

539
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:36,230
where do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys have any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions for</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to store a little information</font>

547
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:06,990
last night you can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I have</font>

548
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:10,740
encoded that in but yeah you can

549
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:14,360
definitely find that i'm using on some

550
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">things i'm using ldap queries</font>

551
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:22,090
on most of them i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the newer</font>

552
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:26,620
control context and principal surgery

553
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:28,389
but under things like the emails<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

554
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">using the old ldap pretty so yeah</font>

555
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything that you can query you know</font>

556
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:35,790
that you can write a transport forth in

557
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:37,960
here and have a pop-up so anything that

558
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:43,330
you can do in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's not just</font>

559
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:44,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not just restricted to just Active</font>

560
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">Directory it's anything that you can do</font>

561
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,310
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have going repository that I'm</font>

563
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:52,210
you can spray the whole net with Wi-Fi

564
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:57,160
if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all the computers to</font>

565
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:59,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">just throw it WI so what I'm going to</font>

566
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:01,720
have there's active directory there's a

567
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:05,680
networking one which will mean if you

568
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:07,570
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run for scans finding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> excel</font>

569

documents of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> few on remote computers</font>

570
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:12,399
you have access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to interesting documents</font>

571

00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:57,369
there's a few different i added three

635
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:57,368
users to easily this

636

638
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,100
but do you need to power show converts

so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you in export you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can generate a</font>

641
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:25,279
report but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to generate a</font>

642
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:26,869
PDF report that you can give to a higher

643
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,609
up or somebody else that means to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

644
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:34,190
you can export it as a table so there's

645
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:36,200
no exact disease I don't actually

646
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:38,240
directly interact back in here feel that

647
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,250
they back out correct yeah you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

648
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,859
export to do like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CSV file and it can</font>

649
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:45,970
pass that<font color="#E5E5E5"> into powershell script it's</font>

650
00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:48,140
all junk but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do with it is</font>

651
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:51,709
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell scripts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

652
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:53,118
that accepts one entity at a time so in

653
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:57,160
one computer at times this is going to

654
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:59,299
call each each time you can just write a

655
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:04,118
transport you can add a local transform

656
00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:04,119
in there to call that power capacity

657
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:10,589
any other questions you passed an entity

658
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">that has child mountains to get the</font>

659

662
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:22,680
whatever you highlight so you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

663
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:25,200

00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,060
right-click you can't quit you can

665
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,720
select a domain that passes it to thee

666
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:32,520
to the transform the transform campus

667
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,319
with the children it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

668
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:37,259
the domain yet because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's multi who</font>

669
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,720
runs it on whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have selected so</font>

670
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,340
the transforms are just for the specific

671
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,490
entity that you're that you're running

672
