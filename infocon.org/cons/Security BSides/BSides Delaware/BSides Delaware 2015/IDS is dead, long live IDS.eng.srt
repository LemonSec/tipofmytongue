those years I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing network</font>

intrusion detection among other things

6
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:24,730
and they were security so I have a lot

picture of what I think's going on in

the industry right now where he needs to

go is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors for starters you know</font>

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's always a kind of in this case</font>

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,079
right it's just that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's gotten a lot</font>

17
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,780
worse lately on it keeps<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting worse</font>

20
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,570
but we do want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it better but we</font>

do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to close the door and make sure</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that the attackers can't get in as much</font>

as they could to happen for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long time</font>

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you just have to look at</font>

25
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:05,860
blistering going on out there we're all

26
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,380
to see what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about the media</font>

back

and what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do to petition and the</font>

38
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,090
answer to a lot of it is that you know

the defense's we've a lot upon detection

better that's the vendor hey we've got

here from office browser let me get back

144
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,349
answer and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to explain why</font>

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">GERD</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minute and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the time there's</font>

148
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,260
a major seismic shift from what they

149
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,960
have been doing up until that time so if

150
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">we look at it as for as to why they did</font>

151
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,120
see

152
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:35,370
and brought us to where we are today so

153
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,310
why do we divided<font color="#E5E5E5"> that attackers start</font>

154
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,760
using times a number of reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

155
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:44,910
first off the programs that have been

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:47,250
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are processing large pieces big</font>

00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:50,160

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,540
megabytes in size right the requests

160
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,330
going to a web server can be measured in

161
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:00,300
twice or kilobytes the files there's a

<font color="#CCCCCC">the tents of megabytes or even 100 we're</font>

165
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,900
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a massively more complex</font>

166
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:13,050
data structure and what that translates

167
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">into is attack service because at the</font>

168
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,650
end of the day the vulnerabilities that

169
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,919
we face every day in our programs are a

170
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:24,330
function<font color="#E5E5E5"> of volumes of code so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font>

171
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:27,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">to point out study from much or not</font>

172
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:30,690
study but a metric cited by much from

173
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,229
his keynote of 2011 black that that

174
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:36,060
pointed out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when he put an IV has</font>

175
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">had four thousand lines of code there's</font>

176
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,689
15 books I be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out for</font>

00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,659
some study

178
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:44,759
so every<font color="#CCCCCC"> blog that everyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remote is</font>

179
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:46,169

180
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,879
to be a vulnerability not every corner

181
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:49,139

182
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,909
of their you're dealing with program

183
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,549
like Microsoft Office which according to

184
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:57,449
Microsoft's own<font color="#CCCCCC"> wildly has 25 million</font>

185
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:59,519
and fifty million lines of code so we

186
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:01,469
measure a tax represent a number of bugs

187
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,939
in our program and if we're measuring

188
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:04,739
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> program's about the rough metric of</font>

189
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">one to five bucks for a thousand lines</font>

190
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:08,849
of code it doesn't really take a lot of

191
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,039
math to figure out that there's a

192
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:14,539
massive amount of potential bugs that we

193
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:18,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">begin that program and so it's not just</font>

194
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:21,119
offices<font color="#CCCCCC"> right just browsers it is the</font>

that processes data you can get from the

199
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:34,739
internet is now a potential target and

200
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,389
so the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrinkled miss which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

201
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:38,578
really sweet look for the attackers is

202
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:40,739
you know we have all our assets like web

203
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:44,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">servers and dns or locked up in dmz</font>

204
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:47,339
that's right where our desktops<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit sit</font>

205
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">aside the land right deep inside no</font>

any other asset the corporation or in

208
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,750
the organization you're protecting all

209
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,370
the servers are wide open because at the

210
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:59,580
end of the day internal member security

211
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:01,470
is really it's hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you know</font>

it becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost-effective to deploy a</font>

significant amount of network security

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:16,860
and as it turns out what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> also problem</font>

218
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,449
that these programs<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all run by non</font>

the end of the day between the buffer

programs we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are dealing with a very</font>

doing other things and that has changed

00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:50,459
the attackers behave also explore what

233
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:52,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit further on my call from head so</font>

234
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,110
the pies I programs introducing a

235
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:57,060
problem of massive attack surface they

236
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,770
make it easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for an adversary to break</font>

237
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,930
into a system because there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just so</font>

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,199
these programs constantly change over

240
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,420
time clinic so you have office<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

to version 40 something by now right

243
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,930
they keep revving all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time same</font>

00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,430
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all the other browsers but this</font>

245
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,620
also has introduced a problem with our

246
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,449
defenses that we relied upon 10 years

247

ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> network intrusion detection systems</font>

248
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:24,300
so if you go back to about saying about

249
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,540
d the old model where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the round brush</font>

253
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,130

00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,050
you just stopped and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it worked</font>

255
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,230
reasonably well for what we had at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

256
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,300
time but the problem is that doesn't

00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,080
translate it to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> connoisseur it</font>

simply grapes down and fails completely

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:50,490
so you know just to remind us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of</font>

260
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,170
give a refresher there are network

261
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,360
intrusion detection system you're

262
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,410
sniffing packets on the wire maybe

263
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,330
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> reminding your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> intrusion</font>

processes factors in real time in order

267
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,440
to understand what's being said and

268
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,660
what's being done is whether an attack

269
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,400
might be inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that none that's a</font>

270
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,770

<font color="#E5E5E5">apply order to determine whether</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

272
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,040
the traffic is hostile or not because

273
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:16,260
again for black mystic right we're

274
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,069
assuming everything is good unless<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

275
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,260
can look at something you compare

276
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:23,170
you know 10,000 signatures let's say

277
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,060
I've known that so we have to do a lot

278
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,670
of processing to do that I'll show some

279
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,930
real world examples in a few slides but

280
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,640
at the end of the day you know that was

<font color="#E5E5E5">always kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of rough arms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is where we</font>

guys are bred the signatures and on top

there's this is a signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Detective</font>

now as complex as this signature is what

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:27,279
it does demonstrate is how well you can

365
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:49,180
it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> one minute fox talking to</font>

I'll

to use this function on you to say

canonicalize function all of that

376
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:12,210

385
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:31,529
through the arduous process of walking

387
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:37,860
to determine is the function homenet

00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:40,230
have canonicalize being all one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

389
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,420
number two if it is what's the sizing

argument that's being presented to that

391
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,140

you're looking to see is the vulnerable

398
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:03,720
so here's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pact adapter to show a 6 of</font>

the packet capture on wire yourself and

00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:23,339
that's fantastic so you can easily

00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,350
really it's a matter of all vendors

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,860
should be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to catch this in spite of</font>

are actually superfluous stuff but if

<font color="#E5E5E5">it into a functional attack method and</font>

543
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:51,408
then it will execute it on itself so

544
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,450
it's basically giving it parts to a gun

545

<font color="#E5E5E5">and bullets telling it how to build a</font>

doing

550
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,820
so we have a process where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through</font>

551
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,400
and be honest you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take the</font>

00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,740
shellcode of the buffer overflow we do

553
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,350
some tricks with it to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a ski we</font>

00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:15,379
encode that some so we can put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that into</font>

556
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,550
JavaScript we go ahead and we take the

557
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,680
we put all that together with the NOC

558
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,879
code of the shellcode and then we put

559
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,640
all that together with some further

560
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,930
appreciation we're basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

561
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,190
it's not an easy assembly right there's

562
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,440
some tricks here that are going on with

563
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,750
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript to make it non obvious</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript with the JavaScript engine</font>

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,919
set of steps here we're really getting

00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:08,040
into some further appreciation for self

581
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,730
thinking right down below the so we have

582
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,850
make PDF arguments we have PDF night

583
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,470
extract and then we have down below

584
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:18,799
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are through some rubies stuff</font>

00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:20,809
taking in na foo and Hopi fu function

586
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,970
call and we're giving us some arguments

587
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:24,918
that are basically PDF structure

00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">got some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript coming and then</font>

593
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:36,559
here's the job strip any so we're taking

594
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,320
those strings as input to the non-food

595
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,928

00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,580
the non-food function call we go through

it and basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this function is</font>

598
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,360
doing is iterating through every

00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:21,680
we can't play a gunfighter we have to

852
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,390
play chess we have to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the home</font>

853
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,680
from we have to get over the idea that

854
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:26,900
we're never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let them in the</font>

855
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">environment we can't assume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font>

856
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get any environment we have to</font>

857
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,340
live in a world out after seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> factors</font>

858
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,110
that control now that they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

859
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">get down there probably in the</font>

860
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,649
environment already when I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

861
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">this business of 99 I was right on we</font>

862
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:41,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">got to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different contingent about five</font>

863
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:43,909
years it goes like yeah I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder</font>

864
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,610
who's in on it and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> long has it been</font>

865
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:48,290
here and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really reminds that we</font>

866
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:50,030
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into us not amazing Munson</font>

867
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:52,010
especially for managers what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

868
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,570
convince them of that because that's the

869
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:55,610
way it is they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to come to</font>

870
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,350
terms we run state of denial if you

871
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,969
think anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> else right now go back to</font>

872
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:02,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that chart</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information is beautiful</font>

873
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:04,160
I know there's a day of course you know

874
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:06,200
the key thing with jess's you can't win

875
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:09,110
in one move you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play it at least</font>

876
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,060
five to ten moves<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe 20 maybe 30</font>

877
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:13,010
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you and you're at home so</font>

878
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:15,770
really though problem is we don't have

879
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:17,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">options to all of our defensive</font>

880
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:20,240
technologies are built around that idea

881
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,590
stop them before they get in we are now

882
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,420
starting to see in the last few years

883
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:25,520
technologies coming out from the vendor

884
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:29,360
spaces that starts to look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

885
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get in we gotta</font>

886
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,860
live with that

887
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,360
it's a hard sell because again nobody

888
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,550
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to own the idea that you're</font>

889
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,469
already hungry but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to get to</font>

890
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:40,240
that place so we need to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with</font>

891
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:42,610
some new<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some new means of</font>

892
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,310
defending in order to actually take

893
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:46,810
advantage of those key differences once

894
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:48,399
they're on the inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> and want to take</font>

895
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:50,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">advantage of opportunity presented to us</font>

896
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,990
by the adversary being in our backyard

897
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:57,130
that we know they don't and they have to

898
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:58,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">move carefully so I'm done here this is</font>

899
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:00,640
just a soft point to think about what

900
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:03,430
we've got we need to stop depending upon

901
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,100
bulging attempts to reach network just

902
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:08,770
have to stop it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's we've lost that</font>

903
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,150
game it's done it's open what we do need

904
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:12,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do is start playing deeper game</font>

905
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:13,870
assume they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in do</font>

906
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,490
everything we can to stop them you know

907
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,810
if you stop best practices I'm trying to

908
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:18,790
prevent them committing it's just going

909
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:20,679
to get worse so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can't stop what we're</font>

910
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:23,620
doing but we need to refocus and put new

911
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:26,860
resources in there getting in there

912
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:29,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">already in how do we do we need to stop</font>

913
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,970
looking for the malware itself I don't

914
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,290
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> honest all your</font>

915
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:33,629
antivirus kiss at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day if</font>

916
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:36,119
you do see something

917
00:34:33,629 --> 00:34:37,768
or people good problem is that will

918
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:39,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the old Baron and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

919
00:34:37,768 --> 00:34:41,638
variants gets deployed and then we'll be

920
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:44,038
not terribly<font color="#CCCCCC"> affected but there's no</font>

921
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:45,450
solid alternative yet so i wouldn't say

922
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:47,250
rip it out is happening with intrusion

923
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:48,868
detection on the network which has a new

924
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,969
role<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this type of defense i'm going</font>

925
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:51,950
to talk about in a few but the end of

926
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:54,299
the day we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the behavior</font>

927
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:57,569
right we actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to knuckle down</font>

928
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:59,670
now and deal with what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the bad guys</font>

929
00:34:57,569 --> 00:35:01,558
doing in our network<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for what the</font>

930
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,720
end up if a guy how the bad guys

931
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:06,509
behaving through his malware we<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta</font>

932
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">stop fighting that tool sentence looking</font>

933
00:35:06,509 --> 00:35:11,970
for open source which doesn't work in

934
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:14,848
<font color="#CCCCCC">Adobe in browsers office we're ever need</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to deal with anything against and</font>

936
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:18,539
engaging the adversary creme that's the

937
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,130
game of chance you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> HS against the</font>

938
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:21,359
pieces on the board you play a game<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

939
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:23,609
chess against that guy's<font color="#E5E5E5"> edition</font>

940
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:26,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">crossword ultimately their people they</font>

941
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:29,098
make mistakes<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do stupid things you</font>

942
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:30,180
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage and you got to be</font>

943
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:33,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to be in a position to take</font>

944
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:36,089
advantage so how do we do so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

945
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,470
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the kill chain yes I'm</font>

946
00:35:36,089 --> 00:35:39,269
going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kill chain can</font>

947
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:42,538
get over this twice are going to eat our

948
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:43,919
vegetables and use those terms so the

949
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:46,710
kill chain was developed by Lockheed

950
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,259
Martin published back in 2011 something

951
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,880
like that ah and you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

952
00:35:49,259 --> 00:35:53,309
their graphic take it from their favor

953
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,349
and you know they have a very but their

954
00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:56,700
idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very straightforward the DoD had</font>

955
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:59,040
a methodology mentality

956
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,390
find out what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tiger has to do in</font>

957
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,690
order to do you harm what's their

958
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:06,930
process aec however many to you are now

959
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:09,240
harm find ways to stop their process at

960
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:11,399
any and all points so that they can't

961
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,200
get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that final step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you break the</font>

962
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,050
process you prevent them from getting to

963
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,810
where they need to be I love this either

964
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:21,119
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is fantastic they even go into some</font>

965
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:23,670
fantastic death to say you have options

966
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">you could detect them you can deny them</font>

967
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:27,510
access you can disrupt what they're

968
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,940
doing you can degrade their capability

969
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:31,800
you can deceive them which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really like</font>

970
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get into a bit more you can destroy</font>

971
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,250
them now has probably not an option in

972
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,078
the commercial space it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> an option</font>

973
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,940
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government space but that's</font>

974
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,400
neither here nor there<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh but at the end</font>

975
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,500
of the day it is a useful means to

976
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,490
determine how to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that behavior</font>

977
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,440
we have to understand what their

978
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:48,209
behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> is already i don't know how ABT</font>

979
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,150
bar so if we apply a kill chain to it

980
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:53,460
that might help<font color="#E5E5E5"> us out now the problem i</font>

981
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:58,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">have in the locking kill changes notice</font>

982
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:59,460
it's very heavy on the getting pucks

983
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,170
step right so it goes from

984
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,730
reconnaissance to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said</font>

985
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:05,310
reconnaissance find out what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

986
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:07,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> victim environment weaponize a</font>

987
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:09,630
rover flow that's all that research you

988
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:12,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to do that deliver the payload that</font>

989
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:15,210
research the victim<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exploitation</font>

990
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:18,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens box gets popped bad good runs</font>

991
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:20,670

where we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to live that last step</font>

take out the weaponization and to take

out the installation marks because

00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:05,270
that's completely in the adversaries

flip that point and focus on what they

00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:16,460
yeah we do some attack delivery and yeah

1018
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:19,069
we do some pine exploitation without see

four boxes and more boxes until he

1032
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:45,230
point if you find three of his 20 boxes

not kill chain we need that allows us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

the bones that let you know right beside

1050

something

1133
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:26,570
can be useful behavioral detection

1134
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,800
technology this is where that's a little

1135
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:29,210
bit harder because you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font>

1136
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,130
to understand your environment whoops

1137
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:33,290
normal that's not but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same time</font>

1138
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:35,540
some of adversarial behaviors like bnsf

1139
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:37,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">latin fast flux do kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of stand out</font>

1140
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,750
like a sore thumb if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look them have</font>

1141
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,940
the right tools in order to find them

1142
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,170
then lastly my personal favorite but

1143
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:44,180
what spurred really difficult to

1144
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:46,310
implement is that set of technologies I

1145
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:48,470
think there's a huge potential here

1146
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:50,270
there are a lot of difficulty getting

1147
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:54,379
and I'll go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through all these in more</font>

1148
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:56,630
detail on a couple of songs so having

1149
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,280
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gone through a brief view of</font>

1150
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:01,100
what weekly view on the right of<font color="#E5E5E5"> guild</font>

1151
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:03,290
chain quite excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we should be</font>

1152
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,250
necessarily like left of X point though

1153
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:06,040
I definitely think we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1154
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,150
spend a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time working on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

1155
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:10,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to keep them out as best we can</font>

1156
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,600
but until something assignment comes

1157
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:13,430
along to really shift things in our

1158
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,960
advantage again I think we'd be much

1159
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:16,790
better off spending our resources in

1160
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,130
looking at what do we do once<font color="#CCCCCC"> they come</font>

1161
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:21,380
in so we can close that door again

1162
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:23,240
they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep getting in and we</font>

1163
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,670
are just losing an opportunity don't

1164
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:28,970
focus on them so that the sandboxes you

1165
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:30,830
know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the step on the type of</font>

1166
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:33,049
stream<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you find the batter you take</font>

1167
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:34,790
a file and you better than p.m. which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1168
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:36,410
in the sandbox we see if the PM it

1169
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:38,000
reacts to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the badly and show you</font>

1170
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:40,009
there was over<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow over bow or</font>

1171
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,710
something like that on input at

1172
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:44,150
virtualization you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take your</font>

1173
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,590
applications and you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in a</font>

1174
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,700
virtual container so that the

1175
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:48,890
application software as a buffer

1176
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,779
overflow it can be contained and it

1177
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:52,310
won't affect the overlying system it can

1178
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:54,020
shut it down maybe before buffer

1179
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:56,360
overflow there's a chance we'll execute

1180
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:58,288
malicious code in the environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

1181
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,969
lasted the application whitelisting

1182
00:43:58,289 --> 00:44:01,109
this one has more interesting

1183
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:03,479
possibility because we're now moving

1184
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:04,949
away from that black was so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're saying</font>

1185
00:44:03,479 --> 00:44:06,299
these are the only things that are good

1186
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:08,089
we're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to accept anything else</font>

1187
00:44:06,299 --> 00:44:10,650
and that's the kind of security we won

1188
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:12,269
but you know i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what i'm going to</font>

1189
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:15,059
talk through real quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few slides is</font>

1190
00:44:12,269 --> 00:44:16,738
that there are operational issues with

1191
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:17,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and including it's going to be</font>

1192
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:20,249
difficult to actually implement

1193
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:21,599
especially in the brown building

1194
00:44:20,249 --> 00:44:23,609
environments where we've already been

1195
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,009
closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our got hundreds of thousands</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows or Linux forever running go</font>

1197
00:44:26,009 --> 00:44:29,729
ahead and<font color="#CCCCCC"> try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and figure out what you</font>

1198
00:44:27,479 --> 00:44:32,129
already running when you need it that's

1199
00:44:29,729 --> 00:44:33,538
the challenge there so you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1200
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,549
take all these new technologies on the

1201
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:37,589
left and the right of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exploit online</font>

1202
00:44:35,549 --> 00:44:39,209
kill change and we can map them back and

1203
00:44:37,589 --> 00:44:41,038
see exactly where we cover nick we look

1204
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:43,288
at your able to employ all these in

1205
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:45,329
derry we should get a lot of covers on

1206
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:47,099
all the elements of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kill chain that</font>

1207
00:44:45,329 --> 00:44:49,349
would be nice obviously we can't deflect

1208
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:51,150
all them certainly we don't want to just

1209
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:52,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">to put one of them and of course at the</font>

1210
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:54,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">end of the day we don't want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just buy</font>

1211
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:56,038
products and throw them out there a lot

1212
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:57,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">of security does come down to your</font>

1213
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:00,569
processes of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind out how do you do</font>

1214
00:44:57,989 --> 00:45:01,949
things so you wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> variants and new</font>

1215
00:45:00,569 --> 00:45:04,739
tools where appropriate but you also

1216
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:06,749
want you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at making your whole</font>

1217
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:09,900
operation a bit more security savvy a

1218
00:45:06,749 --> 00:45:11,549
bit more attuned to do things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1219
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,700
help you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the adversary monster in</font>

1220
00:45:11,549 --> 00:45:16,470
your entire

1221
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,549
so and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that point I always</font>

1222
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:19,560
like to point out of issues with

1223
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:21,630
technologies there is no silver bullet

1224
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,740
and you know don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe the vendors</font>

1225
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:24,570
when we tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> this will solve all</font>

1226
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:27,209
your problems sandboxes we have some

1227
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:29,970
veteran problems with capacity with

1228
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:31,380
everywhere you know it's trying to say

1229
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:33,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">about strongly trying to address that</font>

1230
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:36,120
problem variant detection fail and that

1231
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">had to apply a lot of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kid right</font>

1232
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's Barbossa getting out virtual</font>

1233
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:41,790
machine with<font color="#CCCCCC"> adobe and the rest of it</font>

1234
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:44,520

1235
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:46,650
the malware execute in this sandbox with

1236
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,810
the same so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say yes this is bad</font>

1237
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:50,520
the problem becomes that you have so

1238
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:52,470
many files moving across you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't but</font>

1239
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,270
every bottle in that environment so you

1240
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:56,129
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pick and choose most and</font>

1246
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:09,450
problem with specificity where you have

to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> writing the mobile version so how</font>

1248
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:12,149
many versions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> adobe are in your</font>

again back to capacity sandboxes have to

non-starter in other environments it's

and lastly deception this is my personal

favorite it gives the most options

hard to find as they've ever been maybe

1426
00:52:25,329 --> 00:52:29,680
more so so be very careful if you know

your environment where you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

with techniques and methodologies on

I'm so cool so in conclusion old

1442
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:01,839
signature based technologies are no

1443

the right side of that guilt we have to

deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that post compromise get over</font>

1448
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:16,149
the idea that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep them out</font>

1449
00:53:14,619 --> 00:53:18,340
you're not going to get them out that

1450
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:21,980
time is long over if it ever just

1451
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:23,720
those new defenses are new defenses are

1452

techniques we cannot easily be obeyed

1454
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:31,130
and so their signatures will always be

look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at ways that it costs the attacker</font>

1458

a lot in order to try the beta method

00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:44,660
protection we put out most also

00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,509
strategies and techniques tactics that

1461

we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change our veteran tactics to</font>

deal with that modern a discrepancy

1467
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:03,020
and they have one more box they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>
