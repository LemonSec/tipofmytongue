00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:24,380
up on flattered they put me head-to-head

3
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:31,369
in space road and I really wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

4
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:32,720
his oxygen supply talk but luckily the

5
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:37,489
recording<font color="#CCCCCC"> the song so hopefully</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll be</font>

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:40,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back so my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name is justin klein</font>

7
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:44,720
team i work at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a company called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> faint</font>

8
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:47,599
works developer tool kits<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am here in a</font>

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,610
personal capacity represent my company I

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,190
basic things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that prevent people my</font>

11
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:55,210
company so just keep that in mind as

12
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:57,680
you're solely my opinions<font color="#E5E5E5"> on security</font>

13
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,710
I've been working in the field for about

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,149
seven months so it's relatively new to

15
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,939
me so these are a lot of lessons<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned</font>

16
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:07,700
that I've picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in my short time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

17
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:10,158
Internet of Things security um I'm going

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,040
to try and sort of make this talk as

19
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,600
much your talk as you want so if you

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,280
have questions about anything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say</font>

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,259
please throw up a hand and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll take</font>

22
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,909
pause it feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer questions I</font>

23
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:24,289
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> some time again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for questions as</font>

24
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:26,359
well but I sort of thought the good way

25
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:27,770
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> frame this discussion would be around</font>

26
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:31,339
this project that i've just recently got

27
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,899
involved in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I dolfin project so</font>

28
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,909
this project was started up by two guys

29
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:38,590
who used to be well they both used to be

30
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:43,039
hp1 still is dan miller and<font color="#E5E5E5"> chris</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> smith</font>

31
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:45,529
and they worked at HPD doing basically

32
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:48,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">an evaluation in my msg products and</font>

33
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:49,609
produce the white paper and out of the

34
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:51,708
<font color="#CCCCCC">fundings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that white paper they sort</font>

35
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,178
of came up with a list of top 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

36
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:56,420
a team owner abilities and attack

37
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:58,520
surfaces and by the time I found them I

38
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,000
come from a developer background so I

39
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,009
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> the project</font>

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,660
looking at ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find resources for</font>

41
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:07,680
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are building IV systems and</font>

42
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:09,600
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we could sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,120
know enable those folks to give them

44
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,910
food<font color="#E5E5E5"> best practices</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> toolkits framework</font>

45
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,680
solutions so that we wouldn't constantly

46
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,359
be repeating this sort of trainwreck<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

47
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,670
the space that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're seeing right now in</font>

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:26,190
iOS me so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to sort of</font>

49
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,350
define what the Internet of Things is

50
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,390
right this is this is a surprise books

51
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,980
to learn but this is a marketing buzz

52
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,869
word and not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a specific</font>

53
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,850
technology so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really broad</font>

54
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,090
feel that you can kind of pick and

55
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:41,310
choose in between<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing or</font>

56
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,200
how you define it Eilistraee

57
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,730
differentiator is the first sort of

58
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,859
phase of Internet of Things was just

59
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,390
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> control devices great so these</font>

60
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,980
were devices you may be hooked up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

61
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet and then can reach</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> command and</font>

62
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">control you can use your phone like open</font>

63
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,019
and close your<font color="#CCCCCC"> garage or over and I was</font>

64
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of like the earliest evolution of</font>

65
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,500
Internet of Things what we're moving

66
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">towards is Internet of Things consisting</font>

67
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,300
of autonomous devices that can talk to

68
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,730
one another right so machine to machine

69
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,709
or end and communications as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

70
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,298
with the users with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the central hub</font>

71
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,310
distributing information doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

72
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:13,500
like mesh networking and carrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

73
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,720
much more<font color="#CCCCCC"> complex sort of analytics and</font>

74
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,030
autonomous tasks than just turning on

75
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,489
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> coffee pot if you wake up</font>

76
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,810
so most people think about another thing

77
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:24,370
security and they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

78
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,620
kinds of incidents right your big

79
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,060
monitors or you know Charlie Miller

80
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,579
Chris but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> X research just</font>

81
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,530
destroying cheese or any of the work

82
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:33,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that Samy Kamkar you're not familiar</font>

83
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,730
with many stories you should go check

84
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,290
them out<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of music sort of</font>

85
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,328
ledge hopes like a lifestyle<font color="#E5E5E5"> epic all</font>

86
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,349
this junk hacking right that you know

87
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,970
there's all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people going to the</font>

88
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:44,738
garage<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding internet-connected stuff</font>

89
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,950
and just ripping it apart finding

90
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:49,209
security holes the reality is when you

91
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:53,040
look at most of these hardware hacking

92
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:56,739
or or you know other iOS he hacking

93
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,989
stories and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of media you</font>

94
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:01,060
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> covering events they tend to be</font>

95
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:03,430
consumer focused and I think that sort

96
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">of creates an unfair playing field for</font>

97
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,049
IOT<font color="#E5E5E5"> right if you're developing an IOT</font>

98
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:09,700
solution for a consumer<font color="#E5E5E5"> right a home</font>

99
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:11,019
consumer especially you're basically

100
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,540
considering that you're going to deploy

101
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:15,459
this device into like a very of limited

102
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,529
connectivity<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pendley trusted network</font>

103
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:18,789
right a homeland something like that and

104
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:20,168
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> selling to people that want</font>

105
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:23,110
features they don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

106
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:24,639
security greatly my wife got me an Apple

107
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,930
watch for my birthday I don't like this

108
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,699
is awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't even care if it's</font>

109
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">right like it just knows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

110
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:31,560
scout behind so that's what the

111
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,150
consumers are looking at these

112
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,400
employments are looking for right they

113
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">just want the nests to automatically</font>

114
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,460
adjust their temperature while they're

115
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,870
driving on rotate they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care</font>

116
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">that might be next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll trading</font>

117
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,400
sensitive data from inside their mamas

118
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,470
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately the manufacturers</font>

119
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,760
of this class of IOT don't really care

120
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,900
about security because they know it's

121
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,370
not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be marketed</font>

122
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,020
differentiator and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really going</font>

123
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,970
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurt their sales and that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

124
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">forever except maybe arguably in the</font>

125
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:59,130
case of<font color="#CCCCCC"> gene where that's going to come</font>

126
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,300
what we really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be focusing our</font>

127
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,790
efforts when we're thinking about IOT

128
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,800
security are these from<font color="#E5E5E5"> survival right</font>

129
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,200
so this is industrial IOT this is

130
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,690
manufacturing IOT this is municipal IOT

131
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,550
this is iose help there right so these

132
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">are connected devices that exist in</font>

133
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:18,720
businesses rate so companies like you

134
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:21,270
know John Deere or caterpillar<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you</font>

135
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,610
know siemens like these are big you know

136
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies that are producing very</font>

137
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,080
expensive very complex pieces of

138
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,400
physical hardware that want to connect

139
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,139
these devices to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet and</font>

140
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">connect the devices to one another right</font>

141
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:36,090
and so the security challenges around

142
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,070
this class of IOT share a lot in common

143
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,599
with consumer IOT but I think it's going

144
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be there it's a tougher nut to crack</font>

145
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,289
great first of all you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully</font>

146
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,270
these the pollutants are going to be

147
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:47,340
much larger and face a lot more security

148
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,349
scrutiny but<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OWASP</font>

149
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,539
IOT project these are the kinds of

150
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,800
deployments are looking for so so if

151
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,150
you're a builder I think you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

152
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,830
able to get some good information about

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,479
knitting the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> few slides if you're a</font>

154
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,099
breaker zone you're probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

155
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,780
see a lot of stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use to</font>

156
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,310
make a test<font color="#E5E5E5"> these kinds of systems as</font>

157
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,750
well going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of common</font>

158
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,310
failures and these kinds of systems and

159
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,870
so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth that you can use in</font>

160
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,220
your own environment I would encourage

161
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,380
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you want to get into this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> field</font>

162
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,249
to start ripping off some consumer is

163
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,689
you stuff

164
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:13,769
the easy playground for you you're not

165
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:15,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> base</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off a lot of resistance</font>

166
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:17,549
from those devices but once you decide

167
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:20,789
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get serious when we get to this realm</font>

168
00:06:17,549 --> 00:06:23,969
is definitely the place so why are these

169
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:25,649
organizations doing you talked about

170
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:26,639
security people and you say hey my

171
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:27,869
business is thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

172
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,129
everything up to the internet right

173
00:06:27,869 --> 00:06:31,319
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> water sensors up</font>

174
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:32,729
and then do pressure<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensors and you</font>

175
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,339
know making valve controls and our

176
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:36,329
nuclear you know facility your<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

177
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:38,939
people are going to say you're a moron

178
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:41,279
why would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> videonics please</font>

179
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:43,259
don't the reality is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a very</font>

180
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,989
compelling business case to do all of

181
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:48,360
this right so if you as a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> owner</font>

182
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:50,039
can act collect and aggregate data about

183
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,989
all of the various components<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your</font>

184
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,409
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can make all sorts of</font>

185
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:57,388
really interesting decisions based on

186
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:59,279
that data that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very real</font>

187
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:02,009
financial impact on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> company right</font>

188
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,439
so UPS<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a like one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the poster</font>

189
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:06,239
children for IOT in industry right so

190
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:07,559
they have sensors on all of their trucks

191
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,568
and those sensors<font color="#E5E5E5"> are reporting all</font>

192
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:13,739
sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like tire pressure you</font>

193
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:15,659
know fuel levels oil levels maintenance

194
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:17,039
times locations and they're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

195
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:18,179
four outings and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

196
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,829
they're also using them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with</font>

197
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:21,058
called predictive analytics and they're

198
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:23,069
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the data coming back from</font>

199
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:24,689
their fleet of trucks and trying to spot

200
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:26,489
patterns that will indicate that a truck

201
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:27,929
is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to break down and then they'll</font>

202
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:29,878
perform preventive maintenance on the

203
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:32,399
truck right so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a clear win for</font>

204
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,379
UPS right if they can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a truck</font>

205
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,819
before the fuel runs low and the engine

206
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:37,799
blows up they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> save themselves a lot</font>

207
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">of money not only that they can plan</font>

208
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:43,469
their repair cycles you know in sort of

209
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,029
ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will prevent a sudden influx</font>

210
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:47,459
of trucks that need to be repaired in a

211
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:50,380
backlog right so this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like data</font>

212
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:52,120
analytics business process optimization

213
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,530
really really attractive for businesses

214
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,810
and that's why they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move the</font>

215
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">ifc despite the security mr. they're</font>

216
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,150
definitely gonna be aware that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

217
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,070
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it anyway because there's a</font>

218
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,120
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be made here and i think</font>

219
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,240
was like the latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> Harvard Business</font>

220
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">Review focused specifically on the</font>

221
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,790
financial<font color="#CCCCCC"> winds from going patentee so</font>

222
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,620
it's definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming the other thing</font>

223
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,850
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with IOT right is with</font>

224
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,830
the traditional device it might be

225
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,630
collecting a lot of data but typically

226
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,270
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to the device</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to extract</font>

227
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,680
that data like minion or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

228
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,390
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so this is data that would be</font>

229
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,010
very valuable to a large<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

230
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:26,229
people but it really only has one

231
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,789
interface if you connect that device<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

232
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:30,070
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet then what you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is you</font>

233
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,409
can parse allow access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data from</font>

234
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,789
that device and give different pieces of

235
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,500
the data to different people based on

236
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:37,150
authorization models so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

237
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,590
clear to see in healthcare environments

238
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,880
right where you might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know</font>

239
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,830
some sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare machine is</font>

240
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,419
collecting data from a patient and that

241
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,950
data might be useful for the patient

242
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:46,329
just for their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> healthcare records it</font>

243
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,770
might be useful for the doctor for the

244
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">new kind of sees it might be useful for</font>

245
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:52,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nurses or the other medical staff on</font>

246
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,740
the floor for<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitoring what's going on</font>

247
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,480
with that particular patient it might be

248
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,130
useful to the manufacturer of the device

249
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,140
dude is kind of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of preventive</font>

250
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,000
maintenance and predictive analytics and

251
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,620
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe even the technician is going to</font>

252
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,180
come in and service the device and maybe

253
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,380
spot problems to prepare it but

254
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,819
obviously you don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be giving</font>

255
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,520
all the data to all of those people

256
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">right but as soon as you get into an IOT</font>

257
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,699
environment you can take all this data

258
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:15,280
off of the device put it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of</font>

259
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:18,190
repository and then enforce you know

260
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,290
authentication and access you know

261
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,880
schemas that will allow the various

262
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,920
different people to get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

263
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,900
various data and to share promoted right

264
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,969
so this is a huge promise in healthcare

265
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,500
rightly I begin an MRI<font color="#CCCCCC"> scan done in one</font>

266
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,970
hospital and I can you get a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

267
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,140
get a second opinion on my condition

268
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,970
totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

269
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,850
because it can access my electronic

270
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:39,690
medical residency sense all the way

271
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:45,210
through other areas of commercial IOT

272
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:47,800
not just health care but so

273
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:50,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">shiftingfocus why we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use IOT</font>

274
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">too why is IOT security so bad the</font>

275
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,880
essential problem behind the Internet of

276
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,550
Things security is this an evolutionary

277
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,620
technology right so i don'ti sits on top

278
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,510
of the stack<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can think of all of</font>

279
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,430
these other layers here and supporting

280
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:05,890
Internet of Things in an Internet of

281
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,900
Things deployment you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just make a</font>

282
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:10,300
singular system really<font color="#E5E5E5"> build an</font>

283
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,920
ecosystem right so you have a device<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

284
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,390
it's collecting some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a data and</font>

285
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,069
then you need to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

286
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,090
be well so how are you going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

287
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,530
well first of all we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have to</font>

288
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,820
connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device to the network so</font>

289
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,100
that we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day off the device</font>

290
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,650
the device might not be powerful enough

291
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,940
to do like regular tcp/ip networking so

292
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,520
we might need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect it to something</font>

293
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,260
like bluetooth low energy or<font color="#CCCCCC"> zigbee or</font>

294
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,660
wireless protocol to get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

295
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:34,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">to some other device</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> grow fur</font>

296
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,730
it off to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet you've got all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

297
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,410
the problems of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices built on a</font>

298
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">specific piece of hardware and what is</font>

299
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,100
the hardware security look like

300
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,960
typically most IOT deployments are using

301
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,880
line run-of-the-mill<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating systems</font>

302
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">like Windows Embedded you know Cee</font>

303
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,620
Windows 10 Linux something like that all

304
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,810
of those operating system challenges

305
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,660
that we dealt<font color="#CCCCCC"> with for decades suddenly</font>

306
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,829
manifest inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of IOT we're connecting</font>

307
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,240
it to the network so we've got all the

308
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,220
network security challenges you know

309
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,350
encrypting stuff on the network other

310
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,570
device is able to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like TLS</font>

311
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,279
security what if they're not powerful

312
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,420
enough to do complex encryption then how

313
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:09,310
do we protect messages across the

314
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">network for these devices we develop</font>

315
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,180
custom protocols and hassle with

316
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,579
firewalls well the answer clearly to

317
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,959
this point but<font color="#E5E5E5"> no firewalls basically</font>

318
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,459
blocked everything before dating so

319
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,500
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over like web</font>

320
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:22,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">tracker basically and as soon as you're</font>

321
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,770
throwing people<font color="#E5E5E5"> something over from the</font>

322
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,360
port 80 we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to send it to a web</font>

323
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,860
service and some sort of restful api

324
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,149
that's probably going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> living in</font>

325
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,399
the cloud somewhere so we've got all<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

326
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,770
cloud security deployment on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

327
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,450
any sort of mobile access to the

328
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:36,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">ecosystem is also going to have to be</font>

329
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">considered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i always use building</font>

330
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">on all of this right and i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

331
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:45,029
why everybody intrinsically knows my

332
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,029
experience boundary<font color="#E5E5E5"> like any of these</font>

333
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,200
songs right well what about operating

334
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,760
system security I don't know I got

335
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">through critical</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> patches for Microsoft</font>

336
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,569
on Tuesday<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my desktop with laptop</font>

337
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,399
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> crashes right we're doing terrible</font>

338
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,320
at it and we're building on top of all

339
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:02,470
this making an incredibly<font color="#CCCCCC"> complex is</font>

340
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:05,620
there a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pieces are so</font>

341
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,870
it's clear to see why it would be bad

342
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:11,050
and here is why you see so much evidence

343
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">of things being better right so in IOT</font>

344
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,529
we basically have pastors who are coming

345
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">in or looking at the various components</font>

346
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:19,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this IOT stack and they've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

347
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,709
well developed tools with a long history

348
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,110
behind them and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using these</font>

349
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:24,489
tools just tear apart a coyote solutions

350
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,570
and find problems with cloud

351
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,740
infrastructure with mobile

352
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,810

355
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,199
basically have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Builder so these are</font>

356
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,209
the developers to see the value and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

357
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">money in IOT right so they want</font>

358
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:41,619
businesses to recognize the micro bio<font color="#CCCCCC"> T</font>

359
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,180
or the recognizer they build the next

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,190
network it's not they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

361
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,290
instant billionaires instead of trying

<font color="#CCCCCC">to get into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this field and there's no</font>

363
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:50,890
real good guidelines for these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

364
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:52,240
right there's no sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like the</font>

365
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,339
industry recommendation<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you're</font>

here<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll suit you right Gordon use</font>

368
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,140
this software hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> stunner this is</font>

369
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:01,029
the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will prevent you from</font>

370
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,800
running the problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so generally</font>

371
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:04,420
what developers are doing is they're

372
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,430
just running out grabbing whatever they

373
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,870
can find it cobbling together solutions

374
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,920
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of sticking it long hardware</font>

375
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,900
that works right to say like well

376
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,610
raspberry PI's pretty cheap<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can grab</font>

377
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,800
one of those and maybe I can throw some

378
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,900
bumps<font color="#E5E5E5"> you on top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that and you know</font>

379
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,430
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll use some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flu season there and</font>

380
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,380
then I'll just sense of restful api

381
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,779
calls back and forth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll hug hook</font>

382
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,420
up a sensor<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it and don't make really</font>

383
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:27,310
cool stuff but there's never any

384
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,930
consideration of security in the

385
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,310
procurement if any of those elements<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

386
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,959
there's certainly no consideration get

387
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,609
into what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security duplications</font>

388
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:37,270
of the interaction of all of these

389
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:39,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">different elements and so as a result</font>

390
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,079
basically we have you know developers

391
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,000
building really fragile solutions that

392
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:45,760
fall over very quickly in the base of

393
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,720
scrutiny from the security

394
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,100
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned the hewlett-packard</font>

395
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,030
research study was pretty easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find I</font>

396
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know Internet of Things</font>

397
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:57,819
research study and I think they studied

398
00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:01,750
they work<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2-10 or like 50 different</font>

399
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:03,820
maybe was tendered well IOT devices they

400
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,290
tended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be mostly consumer devices</font>

401
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,390
rights with these are devices that you

402
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,800
would actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> find in the home so is</font>

403
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,390
initially make it better because people

404
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,370
tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take these home things off the</font>

405
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,680
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up will work network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too so</font>

406
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,990
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just like making it better but</font>

407
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,430
the reality is they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were mainly testing</font>

408
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,910
stuff that you could go down to that's

409
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:24,010
mine and I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to these guys</font>

410
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,170
and they really are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in</font>

411
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,400
getting into like industrial IOT testing

412
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,880
something like what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state look</font>

413
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,920
very fair the problem is in most

414
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,660
industries you have was told a

415
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,550
brownfield appointment right so a green

416
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,170
field deployment is you have a situation

417
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,609
here we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem you want to solve</font>

418
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,839
you Stefan is the architect the

419
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,860
technologist you say like here's what

420
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to do it soup the Ducks</font>

421
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,650
we're going to build it this way we're

422
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,140
going to deploy reality isn't most

423
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:49,030
industry industrialists will come to

424
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,710
architects<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say like I've already got</font>

425
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,300
all this machinery and infrastructure

426
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,680
I've got some state assistance I've got

427
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,540
some other monitoring systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got</font>

428
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,099
some internet connectivity some stuff I

429
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,599
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hook it all together and you can</font>

430
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,450
get it into some sort of analytics

431
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,040
platinum right so solutions providers in

432
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,720
this space and are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

433
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,920
heterogeneous solutions they're sort of

434
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,120
saying like well we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a little bit</font>

435
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,740
of this and put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it here a little bit of</font>

436
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,210
this and put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it here we'll do some of</font>

437
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,550
this over here we'll hook it up maybe

438
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:15,400
over some standard protocols like HTTP s

439
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:17,410
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know something like that aggregated</font>

440
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a central data point but ultimately</font>

441
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:22,600
the ecosystem is non-homogeneous right

442
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,400
it's all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things all</font>

443
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,410
over the place and so you can't easily

444
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,840
step into that environment as a tester

445
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,160
and sailing oh hey GE smart factories

446
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,990
and secure in these ways because it's

447
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,329
like well maybe a couple components are

448
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:36,070
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing the other thing</font>

449
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:38,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">is you can't just let go down the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

450
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,520
buy and buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a smart factory and</font>

451
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,979
check

452
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,140
test it so we don't see much in the

as you put on the roadway is the track

traffic and smart traffic lights that

467
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:20,040
would adjust that date on the volume of

00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,900
really amazing results and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you</font>

00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,939
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though we might not hear much</font>

about industrial IL t or commercial

00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,210
entity being bad I think it's not

486
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,319
because it's good it's because we don't

have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real</font>

488
00:16:53,320 --> 00:17:05,030
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into this space I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we</font>

489
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:07,040
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> find so into this mix that's the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">OWASP IOT project or a bunch of</font>

idealistic guys involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT</font>

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,170
everything hey we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a</font>

00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:14,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">difference we quickly realized that is</font>

494
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:17,390
he is massive and that the IOT project

495
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:19,520
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> by necessity had to be an</font>

496
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,810
umbrella<font color="#CCCCCC"> group so there's a number of</font>

497
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">different things that we're doing we're</font>

498
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:25,639
sort of actually like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dan and Craig are</font>

499
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,410
doing these these top two new berating

500
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,790
attack surfaces and vulnerability lists

501
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,790
unfortunately like Google still froze

502
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:33,260
the peyote top<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten but first uh you know</font>

503
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,520
that's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> first search result so if</font>

504
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,900
you're searching for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of Internet</font>

505
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,720
of Things go to the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> result that's</font>

506
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,950
actually a project page not the top 10

507
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,270
we're also looking on developing some

508
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,860
reference solutions and architectures

509
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,350
that we can give to developers to source

510
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,929
a if you're developing ciot this is the

511
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,280
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it securely and to support</font>

512
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,410
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> effort what we're really trying to</font>

513
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,790
do is we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to develop these last</font>

514
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:55,670
two things so we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> develop</font>

515
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,530
some sort of implementation agnostic

516
00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:00,170
principles of security to think about

517
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:04,730
when you're working in IMT and an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ioc</font>

518
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:07,130
framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my spam so in a typical you</font>

519
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:09,890
know web development environment one of

520
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,570
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of canonical pieces of advice</font>

521
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:14,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you get the web developers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is like</font>

522
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:16,939
don't build your own web go out and get

523
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,310
a framework use something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Django or</font>

524
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,710
Drupal or we put whatever you want to

525
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:23,540
use make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it's got security</font>

526
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,400
mitigation against letting the OWASP top

527
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 and all those things and build off of</font>

528
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,250
that and then not what your developers

529
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,470
don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about the problems</font>

530
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,270
there are actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT frameworks that</font>

531
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,480
are out there

532
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:36,490
that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> develop IOT solution log</font>

533
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,960
they're pretty new to the market but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

534
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,280
wanted to create a checklist basically

535
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,170
said like if you're asking somebody

536
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,440
about this island framework should ask

537
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:46,270
this question so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in</font>

538
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,400
an organization thinking about ife i

539
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,840
highly recommend if you're involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

540
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,610
testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would also recommend</font>

541
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,800
it because basically all the questions

542
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,750
are very lean it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like do you</font>

543
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,850
do device ID encryption if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer is</font>

544
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,460
no and you're a tester<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is actual</font>

545
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:02,230
avenue for x ray so it's designed as a

546
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,520
sort of a checklist for people doing

547
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">evaluation but i think you can very</font>

548
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,080
easily use it as a confessor as a

549
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,580
checklist of like waste of Romanticism

550
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,290
we also aggregate a lot of the kidding

551
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,689
resources that we found around IMT<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

552
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:15,159
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a growing community and as</font>

553
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,870
i go through this talk if you see

554
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,360
something they should be a part of our

555
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,899
material or you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can make</font>

556
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,879
a contribution<font color="#E5E5E5"> please reach out to us</font>

557
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:29,710
contributors so<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an evolving</font>

558
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:32,680
project so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oboes ioc top 10</font>

559
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,150
and the categories are accurate but I've

560
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,070
abbreviated the security considerations

561
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:40,240
of recommendations just for the sake of

562
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:41,530
squash a tree I'll read this rate I'll

563
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,780
run through them so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to</font>

564
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,970
swing up but this is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to</font>

565
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,740
like the olas tomten right so these are

566
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,470
vulnerabilities that testers typically

567
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:53,230
find in IOT deployments sort of right in

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:55,240
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of life the most prolific highest</font>

00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,510
want a very small footprint on their

577
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,489

<font color="#CCCCCC">something like that they're rolling the</font>

581
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,460

582
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:24,429
scripts in c and c++ and putting them is

583
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,440
you know putting them on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web in a</font>

598
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:56,020
it your responsibility to secure the

599

600
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,120

00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,070
but that also<font color="#E5E5E5"> ends up in your social</font>

606
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,770
even though basically you ask the

607
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:16,600
probing questions about like do you do

608
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,160
bi-directional encryption between

609
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,899
clients and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> central server</font>

610
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:24,140
vendors will say like know if you want

611
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:26,030
to set that up you can but<font color="#E5E5E5"> right but we</font>

612
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,950
don't do it right so you'll see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

613
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:30,170
deployments exactly where this are like

614
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,910
that's an operational<font color="#CCCCCC"> inspiration right</font>

615
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:33,800
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what we do we give you the</font>

618
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:41,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">rush</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of like cloud-based</font>

619
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:43,280
appointments and change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that model</font>

620
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,800
slightly because now suddenly vendors

621
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,639
are responsible for the core of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

622
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">ecosystem but a lot of companies again</font>

623
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,340
wants to host in-house and so they'd

624
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,590
accept that responsibility so yeah so

625
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,540
that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> huge area of IOT security but</font>

626
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,980
again it's not necessarily IOT specific

627
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,420
it's just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're built you're</font>

628
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,120
bringing new systems engineering

629
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:04,400
ecosystem you might be responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

630
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,110
certain risk that may or<font color="#E5E5E5"> may not be</font>

631
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,750
explicit to you write like a must read

632
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:12,320
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> duel and you're like much</font>

633
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:13,640
responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> pet stuff yeah definitely so</font>

634
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,530
the second one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is insufficient of</font>

635
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,150
education or authorization great so the

00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:19,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">city that are like no user names and</font>

passwords on interfaces depaul usernames

638
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:23,390
and passwords on interfaces easily

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,669
device and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a death</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

644
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:36,290
something could drop to her<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jones in</font>

645
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,370
secured network services is a big one

646
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,830
and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about this one a</font>

647
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:41,060
little bit later but basically utilizing

648
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,250
network services that don't have a

649
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,899
security component<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and this sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

650
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,820
comes up as part of the framework

651
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,320
assessment but one of the first things

652
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,960
that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do if you're testing an</font>

653
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,120
IOT device is taken into a hostile

654
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,830
environment basically means like rip it

655
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,489
out of its ecosystem it put it in one

656
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,559
that you

657
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,940
right and most developers don't consider

658
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:00,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">that like you never think about like</font>

659
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,809
what if somebody hijacks DNS it's like

660
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:04,160
well you're responsible for your DNS

661
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:05,600
infrastructure so I could do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

662
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,940
that's the first thing a tester is going

663
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,980
to do is say like what queries is this

664
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:12,980
device making it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I misdirected ray</font>

665
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:16,280
can I attempts to degrade any encryption

666
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:18,800
that's applied can I get access to any

667
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,360
information and you know probably not

668
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:24,080
shockingly a lot of IOT deployments

669
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:25,610
won't bother using encryption especially

670
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,020
if you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the transport</font>

671
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,729
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> close to the device so they're</font>

672
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,350
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> went with you little energy or</font>

673
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,400
severe something like that was you'll

674
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,928
find that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even any</font>

675
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,510
protections of line because basically

676
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:37,360
the thought is as an attacker you have

677
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:40,790
to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> physical access or very close</font>

678
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:44,659
proximately to the device which is not

679
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:46,399
all that hard so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we find like lack of</font>

680
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,630
transport encryption privacy concerns

681
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,070
this is a huge one that's sort of like

682
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:52,190
closely related that I'm kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of touch</font>

683
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:54,559
on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit it's not entirely my</font>

684
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:58,970
focus I think privacy in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT space</font>

685
00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:01,160
is a really tricky challenge because

686
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,660
there's not really many good technical

687
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,670
solutions right like there's not like a

688
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:07,309
privacy module you can like slap on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

689
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,929
IOT solution and have it be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font>

00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:18,920
are designed to you like collect data

693
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:22,220
about their environment right so you

694
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:24,020
have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like sensors that are just</font>

700
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:37,880
down and you use an app like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> log in</font>

701
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:42,230
you start up that app there some sort of

00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:02,540
instances in IOT where people who are

712
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,870
legally not able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide consent</font>

713
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:08,120
about data collection miners being

714
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:09,729
exposed to coyote environments right so

715
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,100
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is data it's all getting sucked up</font>

716
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:15,050
and oftentimes them out without the

717
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,120
consumers knowledge or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers</font>

718
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:18,740
knowledge in secure cloud interface and

719
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,570
secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile interface pretty typical</font>

720
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,610
stuff in sufficient security

721
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,290
configurability so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is another one</font>

722
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:27,260
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with IOT because a lot</font>

723
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:29,450
of IOT devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any human user</font>

724
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:31,280
interactions right like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to don't have it</font>

725
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,990
interface for people so it's very

726
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,300
difficult for a person to understand

727
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:37,250
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the device to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a does it need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

728
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">update how do i update it what's the</font>

729
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:42,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">security posture of the device you know</font>

730
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:45,710
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to update firmware how would</font>

731
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,178
that happen don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even know and you know</font>

732
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">this applies it to number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nine which is</font>

733
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:52,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">in security software firmware so this is</font>

734
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:56,270
typically IOT devices that will allow

735
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:58,129
you you know side load or load firmware

736
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,480
updates on the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it will check</font>

737
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,100
whether those updates for those

738
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,660
additional software components are valid

739
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,699
and should actually be on the device and

740
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,900
lastly explore physical security right

741
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,070
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the hardware hacking where</font>

742
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,870
you actually just crack<font color="#CCCCCC"> the gate so</font>

743
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,370
often things and you start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

744
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,678
chips<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you start pulling out you</font>

745
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:15,439
know flash memory and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking a look</font>

746
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:18,670
at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you think VIN walk to uncover</font>

747
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,670
what's going on

748
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:24,610
or these devices sometimes will happen

749
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,530
USB or Ethernet ports that will<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

750
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:28,389
privileged access they'll have like jtag

751
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:33,160
interfaces that are disabled and they go

752
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:35,770
production all so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> looked at all that</font>

753
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:38,890
and we try to develop an IOT play list

754
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:40,629
of principles and security and so these

755
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,970
are sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of designed to be kind of</font>

756
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:44,170
marketing there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to be the</font>

757
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,820
kinds of things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should present</font>

758
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to your developer to your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CTOs but</font>

759
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stop thinking about doing an IOT</font>

760
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:51,340
deployment and like what are the kinds

761
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">of things that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to keep you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

762
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,090
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back of your mind about the</font>

763
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:57,490
problems that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to you know crop</font>

764
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,840
up a drive did you<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5c deployment so the</font>

765
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:02,650
first thing you need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is assume a</font>

766
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:05,230
hostile act right so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here is</font>

767
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:06,970
that you deploy your IOT devices into a

768
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,890
physical environment that's beyond your

769
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:11,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">control and you need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> consider the</font>

770
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:12,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">impetus so as a touch with this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is ok</font>

771
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,430
the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you didn't take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

772
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">device put in hostile environments or we</font>

773
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:18,370
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

774
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,889
developers don't really consider that

775
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:22,659
right they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider that somebody</font>

776
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,460
might actually open the device off they

777
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,200
might intercept networking traffic they

778
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,420
might interrupt networking traffic to

779
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,910
see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens right they might change</font>

780
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,800
out components they may try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> download</font>

781
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:34,990
firmware and run it in a virtualized

782
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,100
environment they control so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you always</font>

783
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,410
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to consider whatever you're</font>

784
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,120
deploying on your edge is deploying into

785
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:41,680
a hostile network and you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this where</font>

786
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,300
this causes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most problems is people</font>

787
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,960
put stuff like authentication

788
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:48,330
credentials into software that goes

789
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,460
right because you're basically writing

790
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,870
down usernames and passwords maybe you

791
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,190
might try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to abuse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get it but you're</font>

792
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,229
putting that somewhere on a devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

793
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">your computing devices right so that it</font>

794
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,110
becomes very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy for them to try and</font>

795
00:27:56,669 --> 00:27:59,760
pick apart that device and find those

796
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,020
authentication credentials so you need

797
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,730
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really careful about what you're</font>

798
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,860
doing you'll see like you know if you go

799
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,870
online and you search for life private

800
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">key exposure incidents you see a lot of</font>

801
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:11,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">people not necessarily specifically IV</font>

802
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:13,020
but in sort of deployment environments

803
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:15,330
where manufacturers will unintentionally

804
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:18,690
put like very sensitive cryptographic

805
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:21,710
material on devices and maybe like not

806
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:23,940
unique so right so they deploy like

807
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:25,919
100,000 routers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this is going</font>

808
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">on this button and you put like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

809
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,580
private key right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so as soon as</font>

810
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:33,110
somebody recovers one private key<font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font>

811
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:36,029
suddenly to bring down your entire body

812
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:38,039
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to test for scale right so the</font>

813
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:39,720
security problems in iOS are really

814
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:42,210
exacerbated my scale even<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple things</font>

815
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,770
like denial of service with IOT

816
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,330
duplicates are typically talking about

817
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,429
like maybe a couple thousand to a couple

818
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:49,590
million devices increases from all

819
00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:51,600
talking and you could imagine the

820
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:53,129
problems that are inherent<font color="#E5E5E5"> there even</font>

821
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,860
something simple like self registration

822
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,240
right leg so you buy a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart</font>

823
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,860
connected toaster<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it on</font>

824
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,289
well how does that thing registered so

825
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:04,080
whatever cloud service that it connects

826
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:05,789
to know like can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> spot a malicious</font>

827
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,559
registration what if like you make a

828
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:09,419
device and you deploy it on a factory

829
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,100
floor and will you know all turn on at

830
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:13,429
the same time you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a self</font>

831
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,779
denial of service condition right there

832
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:17,850
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet applies is like one of my</font>

833
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:19,830
favorite little little principles to

834
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:22,320
apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IOT and I thank God for a</font>

835
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:24,960
Volkswagen for like babies

836
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,340
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was here a top of the system</font>

837

Fred they're capable of making

838
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,870
autonomous decisions and reporting

839
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:33,179
information autonomously and they might

840
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:35,129
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be reporting the truth right just</font>

841
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:36,539
because you see that a diesel motor says

842
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm running clean in the lab</font>

843
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:39,779
doesn't necessarily mean it is when I

844
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,730
clean<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody don't know about</font>

845
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:43,580
Volkswagens little imaginations and

846
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:46,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">flipped out it's just kind of brilliant</font>

847
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,970
and its really basically using software

848
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:49,500
considered<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be false information and</font>

many autonomous devices it<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes</font>

851
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,830
becomes really difficult to tell if a

852
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:57,570
device is compromised it is acting

853
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:59,939
maliciously it's really sending you what

<font color="#E5E5E5">that that's the case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know read</font>

856
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:06,059

know those little field<font color="#CCCCCC"> c devices</font>

858
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:09,480
reporting them everything's great here

859
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:13,500
while they're destroying centrifuges in

860
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:16,230
area you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exploit autonomy so in</font>

861
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:19,169
IOT devices are operating independently

862
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:20,639
of one another but they're also capable

863
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:23,009
operating independently of one another

864
00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:24,570
and doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> very complex computational and</font>

865
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:26,940
cryptographic tasks you need to

866
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:29,580
recognize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> device is a full computer</font>

867
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,440
right and so don't fall back on models

868
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,720
of like using usernames and passwords

869
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,580
for devices to authenticate there's no

870
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,129
reason to device can't have like a two

871
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:40,080
megabyte cryptographic certificate that

872
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:42,120
it can present as its authentication

873
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,699
credential right so you can use this on

874
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,529
technorati to make devices do things

875
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,659
that human users would never do right

876
00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:50,159
like it would just never deal with all

877
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:51,389
that and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use it to</font>

878
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,279
enforce those kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of constraints</font>

879
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:55,769
railing an autonomous device is never

back look through ads reception

882
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:02,360
right like it will actually follow these

883
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,850
sorts of rules intended for you to

884
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,860
expect isolation<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of</font>

885
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:09,169
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite in a lot of IOT deployments</font>

886
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,939
if you take a device and you remove its

887
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:13,040
networking capability or you cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> out a</font>

00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,480
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of ecosystem that it</font>

890
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,580
it'll like fail open<font color="#CCCCCC"> no basically just</font>

891
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:22,040
security mechanisms will go away right

892
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:24,050
and they won't sort of enforce the same

893
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,210
security posture when they're

894
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:28,280
disconnected as with never<font color="#CCCCCC"> connect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

895
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:29,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">so like what happens to these devices if</font>

896
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,670
you cut the internet connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> not eat to authenticate anymore</font>

898
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:36,800
because it can't authenticate you to a

899
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,290
central service photos you need to

900
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,879
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> uniformly so when I talked about</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the IMT ecosystem and all of the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">times what you'll see is you'll see</font>

905

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will try and attach them</font>

907
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:57,410
right so they'll make like complex

00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,870
multi-factor authentication via the web

909
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:01,520

910
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,169
and control the devices in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada</font>

911
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,790
ecosystem and don't forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font>

912
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:07,040
a mobile app that allows you answer

913
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:08,780
afford to jump in and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to the</font>

914
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,060
exact same thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile app isn't</font>

915
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,500
talking some light you know magical

protocol that's talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the same</font>

917
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,580
and all an attacker needs to do is bind

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,900
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile interface and suddenly the</font>

919
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:20,030
challenge of breaking it goes from

920
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:22,880
complex multi factor to four digit pin

921
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:24,410
right so you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about IOT ecosystems</font>

922
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,580
you need to think about like what are

923
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:27,140
the detection mechanisms that are

924
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,030
applied and are they applied everywhere

925
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:32,480
do you have a uniform defenses earth

926
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:34,129
surface encryption is tricky and you

927
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,870
know I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a lot working with</font>

928
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,710
developers that like a lot of developers

00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,120
recognize

930

like sprinkle<font color="#E5E5E5"> crypt investment stuff</font>

932
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:46,279
anyway why are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypting like a</font>

933
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:47,450
post parameter or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll play guess what's</font>

934

what he ate a cryptic light we're good

935
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:51,230
for the auditor ceiling it doesn't

936
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:52,940
really do anything and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can find</font>

937
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:55,549
problems where people will do stuff like

938
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:57,590
you'll salt password hashes will use the

939
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:59,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">same salt for every password greatly</font>

940
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:01,220
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to make mistakes with</font>

941
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:03,139
encryption and this is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

942
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,970
don't normally see<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentester to poke at</font>

943
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,529
when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they're sort of attacking</font>

944
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">IOT systems generally because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't</font>

945
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:09,770
have to them have to get to this level

946
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:12,230
but it's been my experience we look at

947
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:13,730
the encryption deployed in IOT systems

948
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:16,220
typically don't our mistakes that

949
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:18,740
basically validate the value of the

950
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:20,179
dependent need to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you do</font>

951
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,679
system hard dick at every level of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

952
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:23,210
stack right so you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a really</font>

953
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,890
awesome IOT deployment but you could

954
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,330
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an SSH service on to the Linux box</font>

955
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:28,039
that's running the edge it you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

956
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:29,600
like the password<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the personality</font>

957
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,820
like passaportes you pretty or something

958
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,110
like that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that</font>

959
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're following all the traditional</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">components of your other infrastructure</font>

962
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">really not just the hardware not just an</font>

963
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,389
allergen also your clout<font color="#CCCCCC"> great like the</font>

964
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:43,010
worst<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have is you</font>

965
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:44,840
would think you could have a bunch of

966
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:46,730
really hardened virtual machine sitting

967
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,949
up an AWS but your management interface

968
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:50,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have like a bad news somebody could</font>

969
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:53,779
just pop right in through the back door

970
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:57,169
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to limit what you can so</font>

971
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:59,899
in the rush to produce you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> product</font>

972
00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:01,279
or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ife market features</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sell and</font>

973
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:02,989
people basically want to build a bunch

974
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:05,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">of features the reality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is there's no</font>

975
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:08,000
reason to ship<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the teachers turn on</font>

976
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:09,679
and turn off as many<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can and this</font>

977
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,270
is another avenue of attack is to see

978
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,159
your sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> see like where the unused</font>

00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,770
for unadvertised features as you go

980
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:17,620
system and can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage on</font>

981
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:19,149
and for a full life cycle support you

982
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,730
need to plan for<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromise you need to</font>

983
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:23,199
plan burping into<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ruffo certain devices</font>

984
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:24,280
you need to plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> for updates I don't</font>

985
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:27,549
know if I mentioned earlier would like

986
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:29,200
the wake home hub but they had a really

987
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:30,970
bad problem like one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their ssl</font>

988
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,678
certificates inspired and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then suddenly</font>

989
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:34,449
like none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their customers could</font>

990
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,790
receive updates and everything failed to

991
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:38,408
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to integrate anymore and they</font>

992
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:39,880
hadn't planned for life cycles what they

993
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,550
have your<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan for like what would we do</font>

994
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:44,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you need to update you know but your</font>

995
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:46,510
your root certificate trust score there

996
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:49,090
and so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much what she</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

997
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:52,480
they started mailing out USB keys but

998
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:54,220
bring them back into the shop it I think

999
00:34:52,480 --> 00:35:00,370
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not out of business now it's</font>

1000
00:34:54,219 --> 00:35:01,899
like it I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that incident data</font>

1001
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:03,430
aggregate is unpredictable this goes

1002
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,310
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Prince of it's sort of the</font>

privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would everyone sees the value</font>

1004
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:10,270
of collecting data in Iowa TV the very

1005
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,000
few people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are thinking about the</font>

1006
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:15,670
privacy implications of collecting idea

1007
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,980
and I really like to talk about the

1008
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:20,860
example of say you're a friend of your

1009
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:23,290
manufacturer of a of a tire pressure

1010
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:24,400

1011
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:28,330
higher pressure sensor that you wanted

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,890
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> report back to home and you want to</font>

1013
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:32,080
aggregate<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this data combined with</font>

1014
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:33,490
other information from economy maybe

1015
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,390
maybe not let's just assume the tire

1016
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:38,439
pressure sensor live in fluid dynamics

1017
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:39,700
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just assume for the sake of</font>

1018
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,860
argument that i know what i'm talking

1019
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:43,720
about physics and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tell based on</font>

1020
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,970
pages<font color="#CCCCCC"> and tire pressure where the car</font>

can tell a college town<font color="#E5E5E5"> houses the</font>

1030
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,910
pretty innocuous like you cares

1031
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,860
especially if I hydrogate that but what

1032

if I what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I watching like one car</font>

1036
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:17,759
steadily increases you know say by like

1037
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,980
four or five pounds and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> suddenly</font>

1038
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,170
overnight it goes to an overall weight

1039
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,520
increase of 12 pounds you might be able

1040

1042
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,529
a woman driving a car and she slowly

1043
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,569
gained weight over the time in her

1044

1050
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,360
sort of like up an arm is very

1051
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,910
sensational unfortunately we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1054
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,880

00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:54,359
of came<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and said I aged an activity</font>

1056
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:57,090
on Ashley Madison that could get me the

1057
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:59,700
death penalty where I live and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure</font>

1058
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:02,040
that ashley madison in design at risk

1059

hold data that<font color="#CCCCCC"> could get people killed</font>

1061
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:07,410
hey and so when we're aggregating this

1062
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,480
kind of stuff especially in an IOT

1063
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:11,310
environment especially at scale to iot

1064
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,050
months especially considering

1065
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:14,759
sensors that there may not even allow

1066
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:16,890
people to opt-in for participation we

1067
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,750
need to think very clearly and careful

1068
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:20,750
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the privacy and security</font>

1069
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,330
need to plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the worst you need to</font>

1070
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,710
assume that eventually you're going to

1071
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:27,450
get compromised what are you to do with

1072
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,610
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up a USB</font>

1073
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,080
key that's going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible the long</font>

1074
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:32,640
haul is an interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so most</font>

1075
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,220
commercial iotv<font color="#CCCCCC"> limits or anywhere</font>

1076
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,379
between like four and twenty years right

1077
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:39,089
so you're designing a system that you're

1078
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,340
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put it yield and it's going to</font>

1079
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:43,680
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lungs so it's really important</font>

1080
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,450
for developers to employ what i like to

1081
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,190
call forward compatible security right

1082
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,779
so new attack vectors are going to be

1083
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:50,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">discovered new defensive capabilities</font>

1084
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,990
and cryptographic capabilities or come

1085
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:53,640
out and if your system is sort of

1086
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:55,529
deployed point in time and it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1087
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,490
upgraded and can be adjusted you're

1088
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:58,200
going to run into problems really

1089
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:59,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly because two three four years</font>

1090
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,020
down the line your systems are basically

1091
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:03,900
going to be degrading in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the base of</font>

00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">advancing attacks transitive ownership</font>

1093
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,930
is women I like to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

1094
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:09,000
nobody seems to be thinkin<font color="#CCCCCC"> Valley so I</font>

1095
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:11,100
build a smart home and then I sell it

1096
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,900
well like what happens to all<font color="#E5E5E5"> in smart</font>

1097
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:17,970
glasses all I think now you suddenly

1098
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,650
find my nest studies and you can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1099
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:21,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">bar fight and security lady what would I</font>

1100
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:25,790
do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that another that in an</font>

1101
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:28,830
industrial space you'll often times find

1102
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:31,860
companies with smart connected products

1103
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:34,500
that use the same products in the same

1104
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:35,820
vertical amongst competitive entities so

1105
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,380
you might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that has like a</font>

1106
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,730
smart vending machine right and city

1107
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,870
they work or coke distributor and they

1108
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">decide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't like that vending</font>

1109
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:43,140
machine rice getting moldy they want to

1110
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:44,970
sell it kind of a Pepsi<font color="#E5E5E5"> destroyed nearby</font>

1111
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:47,310
that machine then pull out proprietary

1112
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:49,439
data from that machine rightly so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1113
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:52,049
computational power is moving along with

1114
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,570
this transitive device and can you

1115
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:55,710
protect it again that speaking of us

1116
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,330
from our homes there was actually a

1117
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:59,970
choice that just happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

individual boogers married he got

00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:04,020
divorced from his wife she married a new

1120
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:06,930
person and he still had connectivity<font color="#E5E5E5"> vis</font>

1121
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:09,210
nice up to the house and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tortured them</font>

in the house<font color="#CCCCCC"> my change of the AC in the</font>

middle of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the night of putting on</font>

1124
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:15,960
speakers for flashing lights yeah she

1125
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,820
had no means of her poking it from him

1126
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,109
because the vendor never put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in right</font>

1127
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,020
because most manufacturers<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font>

1128
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:24,089
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think like do I do</font>

1129
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:27,839
how many do I have to post comments on

1130
00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:29,910
Amazon about how he did that yeah he

1131
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,640
actually he had said he was unimaginable

1132
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:34,170
it's like you know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it well</font>

1133
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,259
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a crazy thing you sort of see</font>

1134
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:39,089
the consumers leading the bleeding edge

1135
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,589
here in terms of information reporting

1136
00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:42,029
that this is happening on an industrial

1137
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:43,529
level to do like one of the big concerns

1138
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,760
with a lot of industrial appliances

1139
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:46,440
let's say I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use strong</font>

1140
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,970
cryptographic capabilities on my edge so

1141
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,040
I go to somebody like cement maker paris

1142
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:52,580
by cryptographic certificates that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1143
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,990
deployed to plan choices well desert

1144
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:57,029
what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> missile anyway so i can</font>

1145
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:59,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this working back late does</font>

1146
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:01,380
that circle my competitor like how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1147
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:03,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">D provision that and you know you'll</font>

1148
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,349
find answers from industry they're like

1149
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">well well we've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like an</font>

1150
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:07,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">online certificate status protocol that</font>

1151
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,118
allow you to sort of say<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would be</font>

1152
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:11,190
certificates well an ioc scale doesn't

1153
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,260
work right like you can't have an IOT

1154
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:14,910
device pull down a certificate

1155
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,859
revocation list that's two million

1156
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:20,970
records long and<font color="#E5E5E5"> parson great think it</font>

1157
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:22,440
just can't do it so again its scale and

1158
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:24,149
this last one is one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> favorites</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1159
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,770
just one of these problems that like

1160
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,660
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> good solution right so</font>

1161
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,800
interracial computing systems we have

1162
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">like maybe a one</font>

1163
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,550
one or<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any relationship between</font>

1164
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:34,140
an application right so you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1165
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:36,450
an appt additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> two different users</font>

1166
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:39,540
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have the one application I</font>

1167
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:42,419
would see you don't have a one device to

1168
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:44,490
one user relationship right you have a

1169
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,930
device that might be used by multiple

1170
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:47,160
different people you have multiple

1171
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,259
different people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be using</font>

1172
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,940
multiple different devices you might

1173
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,040
have devices that he took broker

1174
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:54,600
credentials let's sort of operate

1175
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,220
sailing I'm talking to another device

1176
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,870
but i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jones credentials</font>

1177
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,939
to do this because Joe is<font color="#CCCCCC"> trusting on</font>

1178
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:01,799
this other device there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

1179
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,600
authentication mechanism like you want

1180
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about like crazy authentication</font>

1181
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:09,120
skeet how<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great how do</font>

1182
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:10,919
you credential individuals<font color="#CCCCCC"> to devices in</font>

1183
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,420
this kind of a scale in this kind of a

1184
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,950
way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these people are going to need</font>

1185
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,890
different permissions on different

1186
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:19,439
devices right we have no good<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

1187
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:21,779
academic models I don't think or level

1188
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,210
where solve this problem like how do we

1189
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:26,520
do lattice authentication between

1190
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:28,080
devices and that's causing all sorts of

1191
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,210
problems again where you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding</font>

1192
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:32,569
device is doing sloppy authentication or

1193
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:35,640
insufficient authentication or right

1194
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:37,530
conditions so the last thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kinda</font>

1195
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,270
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um the</font>

1196
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:40,830
framework assessment instead of set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

1197
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:42,509
and become a legit based on the model of

1198
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:44,000
this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like prototypical</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT</font>

1199
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:46,530
deploy where you have like you're smart

1200
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,390
for whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's connected</font>

1201
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:49,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Internet and typically it's going</font>

1202
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:51,330
to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> some sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gateway device</font>

1203
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:52,680
right so this may or may not always be

1204
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:54,299
the case but a lot of times you'll point

1205
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,230
I you have some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cloudy of the</font>

1206
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,430
structure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's doing sort of</font>

1207
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:57,600
aggregation this could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

1208
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,220
non-friend thing or it could be

1209
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,600
something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking publicly</font>

1210
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,220
available and then you have some global

1211
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,529
component the baby talking to the

1212
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:06,029
gateway or to the cloud or to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the edge</font>

1213
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:07,530
so we basically broke it down in

1214
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:10,470
security questions you should ask about

1215
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:12,780
the edge the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gateway the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cloud and</font>

1216
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:15,810
mobile and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort of pulled like a</font>

1217
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,539
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ones that I thought the most</font>

1218
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:18,939
interesting

1219
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:20,799
there but when you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors</font>

1220
00:42:18,939 --> 00:42:21,999
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> island see frameworks which is you</font>

1221
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:23,739
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be asking these things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and if</font>

1222
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:25,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're a tester and you're looking at an</font>

1223
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:26,469
eye on<font color="#CCCCCC"> deployment and you're looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1224
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:27,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the edge these are the kinds of</font>

1225
00:42:26,469 --> 00:42:30,910
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to be a significant</font>

1226
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:32,919
very well guy your research action yeah

1227
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:37,660
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a comprehensive list go to</font>

1228
00:42:32,919 --> 00:42:39,368
website again we're always looking for

1229
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,749
feedback so if you have questions did

1230
00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:43,359
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you would ask that our ass</font>

1231
00:42:40,749 --> 00:42:44,618
let's let us know but so on the edge you

1232
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,929
want to know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this communication</font>

1233
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:51,279
encryption is storage encrypted and if

1234
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:52,719
it's not quite does the edge device do

1235
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:54,579
any blogging where does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it store those</font>

1236
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:57,249
logs if it stores it locally that might

1237
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:59,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">not have a whole lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of value on are</font>

1238
00:42:57,249 --> 00:43:00,968
they shipped off to buy some sort of

1239
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:02,469
central aggregation point how those logs

1240
00:43:00,969 --> 00:43:04,089
were kinda did somebody intercept them

1241
00:43:02,469 --> 00:43:06,519
can they tamper with can they change

1242
00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:09,130
them is there an updating device

1243
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:11,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">updating mechanism before the edge can I</font>

1244
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:13,119
tell what version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of software is running</font>

1245
00:43:11,019 --> 00:43:14,589
at the edge does it automatically update

1246
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,630
does it at least report to me that I

1247
00:43:14,589 --> 00:43:18,279
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to update that edge if I do want to</font>

1248
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">do an update how does that happen does</font>

1249
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:21,849
it reach out over HTTP and just grab

1250
00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:23,679
whatever binary is off of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a content</font>

1251
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:25,419
distribution network or does it actually

1252
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:27,669
go and find something off of an

1253
00:43:25,419 --> 00:43:29,109
authenticated site download it chef some

1254
00:43:27,669 --> 00:43:31,719
sort of cryptographic signature before

1255
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:34,089
it installs right are<font color="#CCCCCC"> there default</font>

1256
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:36,099
passwords you find this everywhere or on

1257
00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:37,630
their shared conference right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if</font>

1258
00:43:36,099 --> 00:43:38,769
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not using a default password if</font>

1259
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:40,630
you're sharing a bathroom across<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1260
00:43:38,769 --> 00:43:42,279
entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> infrastructure you're basically</font>

1261
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:44,390
sitting around

1262
00:43:42,279 --> 00:43:46,250
what are the offline security features

1263
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:47,598
great so by pull this device and kill

1264
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,640
all its internet connectivity what is

1265
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,589
new to defend<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself what happens when</font>

1266
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,480
it comes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> online will it do stuff</font>

1267
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:55,160
like cash logs and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward them</font>

1268
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:59,569
when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> back online or we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1269
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:03,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">have all over and how the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Gateway you</font>

1270
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:05,180
have a lot of sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of similar crewmen</font>

1271
00:44:03,049 --> 00:44:07,460
concerns a lot of gateways will perform

1272
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:09,319
encryption or security protocols on one

1273
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,819
side but not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other and figuring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

1274
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:13,279
like whether or not their support there

1275
00:44:10,819 --> 00:44:14,660
for encryption edge to end whether or

1276
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:15,799
not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gateway the brakes encryption</font>

1277
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:17,299
right so you could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gateway device</font>

1278
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:19,400
that's gathering things from an

1279
00:44:17,299 --> 00:44:21,769
encrypted communication on one side<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1280
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,150
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the similar encryption</font>

1281

1283
00:44:25,369 --> 00:44:29,269
unencrypted right like so is the gateway

1284
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,920
of single point security failure is

1285
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:32,180
their local storage for the gateway or

1286
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,519
is it just starting at the proxies and

1287
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:36,859
passing things back and forth encrypting

1288
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:38,450
things locally is there an anomaly

1289
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:39,980
detection capability in any way so in a

1290
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,629
lot of iOS deployments you'll have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

of devices behind a gateway and the

00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:44,900

1301
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:04,430
traditional web interface best practices

00:45:02,779 --> 00:45:07,220
is there a secured web interfaces

1303
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:08,769
Earthian secured web interface is there

1304
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:11,180
a capability to do data classification

1305
00:45:08,769 --> 00:45:13,609
segregation or it's all of your IOT data

1306
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:15,288
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> grown in the same database right so</font>

1307
00:45:13,609 --> 00:45:16,490
your story very sensitive stuff with not

1311
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,899
treat this very protected data because

it's stored<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the same place is the</font>

my overall protection and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of say</font>

1315
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,500
like well I got secure stuff but most of

1316
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:31,619
it doesn't matter so we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack an IOT system</font>

1320
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:39,460
attacking the edge is really easy but

1321
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:42,010
attacking the center is really nice this

1322
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:44,020
is where all the data goes in many IOT

1323
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:45,339
deployments the center is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only</font>

1324
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,500
collecting information from the sensors

1325
00:45:45,339 --> 00:45:48,970
it's also sending out and controls of

1326
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,589
the sensors<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it can actually actuate</font>

the update firmware do that kind of

1328
00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:55,150
thing so a compromised<font color="#CCCCCC"> center is</font>

1329
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:56,589
particularly bad you see this all over

00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:03,730
third-party libraries help support it

1334
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,349
you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like okay jquery makes</font>

00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:07,030
your web interface look awesome are you

respond if there's a vulnerability

1344

that's found in what we support<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1346
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,549
capability right can I tell which device

1347
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,740
did what when if not why not who's

1348
00:46:27,549 --> 00:46:34,150
important is their interface separation

1349
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:35,709
and you never rarely fun right so an

1350
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:37,900
autonomous device is going to send very

1351
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,849
predictable information to the Klopman

1352
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,530
right and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably going to know</font>

1353
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:44,380
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing</font>

1354
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:46,869
very different human user it is the

1355
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:49,059
interface at the center designed to do

1356
00:46:46,869 --> 00:46:50,349
the same for the human user as for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1357
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:51,819
device<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you see a lot of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1358
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:53,230
this when they develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems for</font>

1359
00:46:51,819 --> 00:46:55,480
convenience right they develop<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

1360
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:56,920
interface and to have the device and I

1361
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,390
ran through that this way given interact

1362
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,430
with it this way<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile interacted with</font>

1363
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:02,859
it this way but it doesn't take tester

1364
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:04,240
lon figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out like oh hey I can pretend</font>

1365
00:47:02,859 --> 00:47:06,009
to be a device and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all sorts of</font>

1366
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,700
interesting new interfaces and new

1367
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:10,789
capabilities and do you have like

1368
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,348
complex multi background

1369
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:13,849
right so we've got like a long history

1370
00:47:12,349 --> 00:47:17,449
of providing good on the patient in

1371

securing our web mobile consideration

1372
00:47:17,449 --> 00:47:21,380
I'm sort of going to skip<font color="#E5E5E5"> over just</font>

1373
00:47:18,799 --> 00:47:22,459
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think global security that</font>

1374
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,229
kind of done<font color="#CCCCCC"> to death and there's a</font>

1375
00:47:22,459 --> 00:47:25,640

check<font color="#E5E5E5"> out from better recommendations</font>

1377
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,209
there and generally you want to make

1378
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:32,929
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your mobile devices the</font>

1379
00:47:29,209 --> 00:47:34,640
grading overall<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure so sort of final</font>

1380
00:47:32,929 --> 00:47:35,900
thoughts is that privacy is a big deal i

1381
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:39,288
think i've talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that a lot the</font>

00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:42,140
3-2<font color="#CCCCCC"> federal trade commission is seeking</font>

1386
00:47:48,729 --> 00:47:53,808
they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably going to outline the</font>

1387
00:47:51,529 --> 00:47:55,429
things that I've manufacturers should be

1388
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:58,219
doing and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be fine</font>

1389
00:47:55,429 --> 00:48:00,679
associated with a dead blonde so I think

1390
00:47:58,219 --> 00:48:02,539
we're a big push and IT security really

1391
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:05,239
soon as soon as people understand those

1392
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:06,650
are everything and finally you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1393
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:08,239
consumers might not care about security

1394
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:09,979
but businesses<font color="#E5E5E5"> do like any sufficiently</font>

that you guys work if somebody says I

1399
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:20,599
make it secure right the kinds of things

that most considerable and wasps is

and we disorder best think that the

1429
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:48,280
just look at that upon anything what are

1430
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:50,720
the implications for compromise and how

1431
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,430
all right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people like</font>

00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:06,690
figuring out what kinds of things those

sort of say like okay like I you people

00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,620
who possibly say like security is only

1446

as strong as its weakest link which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1447
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:27,279
kind of true but if you can isolate

00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:30,310
those links you might be a better if one

1449

is an attacker but you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1450
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:35,490
that's how do i actually just assume a

justify it to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business I mean</font>

1462
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,130
you look at government regulation so you

1463
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:12,160
look at finds that the better our

1464
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:15,040
community that the SEC and the FTC<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,779

against businesses for failing to follow

1467
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:21,340
those practices right so the FTC has a

1468
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,170
really great white paper i think it's

1469

<font color="#E5E5E5">like start with security that's actually</font>

practices and you go to your management

1474
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:36,520
you say look the FTC is already finding

1475
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:38,020
people tens if not hundreds of thousand

you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> get their readout</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on what</font>

1481

they think those regulations are going

avenue in two targets ecosystem right so

1489
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:06,049
there are going to be consequences<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1491
00:52:06,049 --> 00:52:08,450
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if you look at</font>

1492
00:52:07,279 --> 00:52:09,589
government fine that's a really easy

1493
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:13,189
stuff because you can sort of sailing

1494
00:52:09,589 --> 00:52:14,630
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you as a business if you</font>

1495
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:16,700
don't address this you're accepting

1496
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:18,920
certain risk and the natural liability

1497
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:30,379
that could cost us is it perfectly like

1498
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:33,729
I OT<font color="#CCCCCC"> Walsh a I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

1499
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:36,319
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that same question</font>

1500
00:52:33,729 --> 00:52:39,950
scenario i work at a college so the

1501
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:43,700
scenario for us know the address<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1502
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:45,410
it's late late in a chat so he comes

1503
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:47,390
across tissue sample those things are

1504
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:50,440
compromised and somebody's turning on

1505
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:52,930
all the lights burning up

1506
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:55,900
projector things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've gotta</font>

1507
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:59,410
in terms of justification why you

1508
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:03,339
isolate these things you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

1509
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:05,799
want to Beverly or quadrupling by power

1511
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:11,050

<font color="#CCCCCC">portal key maker gets turned on at night</font>

1513
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:16,450
you might have to replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> that every six</font>

1514
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:17,410
months instead of every two years yeah I

1515
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:19,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's important to think more</font>

1516
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:21,040
broadly right I think it's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look</font>

1517
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:22,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">at how to you by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the environment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

1518
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,579
like well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many common ways of my</font>

1519
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:26,470
light bulb from cares right like the

1520
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:29,010
reality is if somebody compromises that

1521
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:31,750
light bulb and do something else<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:33,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's where the FTC will come in and</font>

1523
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,050
finding and you'd be like well I is just

1524
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:37,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">a light bulb like I didn't care and it's</font>

1525
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:39,220
like sorry you can apply security due

1526
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:41,470
diligence to your IT infrastructure

1527
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:43,270
uniformly you left certain very opening

1528
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:45,669
spots that attackers were able to use

1529
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:47,800
and so sorry like we're hitting you with

1530
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:50,050
a FERPA violation right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you lost</font>

1531
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,460
twenty thousand student records and they

1532
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:54,520
can go through your smart light bulb but

1533
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:55,599
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care how to go so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

1534
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,609
important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about is like</font>

1535
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,050
these components may seem stupid and

1536
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,930
worthless and like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> damage is very</font>

1537
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:01,310
limited by

1538
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:03,109
or to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of think more broadly about</font>

1539
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:05,150
like these are components in a much

1540
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:06,770
larger ecosystem and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist in</font>

1541
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:08,960
isolation<font color="#CCCCCC"> a compromise might had</font>

1542
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:13,940
initially<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed they would cause a big</font>

1543
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:16,250
deal yeah so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example other light</font>

1544
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:18,590
bulb is play a sound like a silly

1545
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:21,980
example but<font color="#CCCCCC"> here a room with somebody</font>

1546
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:23,810
who has epilepsy and you know someone to

1547
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:27,500
spend the<font color="#CCCCCC"> light bulb lot of all that</font>

1548
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:28,580
organization will get fine yes I mean

1549
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,010
there's all sorts of unintended

1550
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:32,900
consequences i think i really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like i'm</font>

1551
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:35,120
not a fan<font color="#E5E5E5"> of government regulation but i</font>

1552
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:38,750
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that the government</font>

1553
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:40,640
is moving in this direction tool for us

1554
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:43,250
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> to security to go to</font>

1555
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:46,549
management and say look there's going to

1556
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:49,130
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the financial risk associated with</font>

1557
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:53,090
failure to address security in these

1558
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:55,370
deployments so think more broader than

1559
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:57,320
the machine level you mentioned

1560
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:58,970
legal ramifications and or a financial

1561
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,950
risk and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gets a business's</font>

1562
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:02,779
attention yes exactly exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1563
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:04,700
that's it so it's been my experience

1564
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:06,050
that my best friends are the people in

1565
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,310
the compliance<font color="#E5E5E5"> department and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just go</font>
