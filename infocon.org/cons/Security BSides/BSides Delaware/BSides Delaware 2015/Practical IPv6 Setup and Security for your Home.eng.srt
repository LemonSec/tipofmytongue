2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">Seminoles I'm from University</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of nowhere</font>

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,960
I'm a graduate in there and thank you

4
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:22,220
all for coming chlorine I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:26,230
talk about I feet ipv6 set up for you

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:30,289
for your home ha and some security<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:33,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">implications of it oh and I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

8
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:41,960
thank chase for shown in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> ID</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:44,030
help me set it up so before i go into it

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,790
let's ask the question why should we

11
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:51,769
bother to do this why would we want to

12
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:56,150
transition our home network from before

13
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:58,159
to be searched I mean v4 has been we've

14
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:05,750
been using for a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> is stable</font>

15
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:08,420
it's is good it works so probably a lot

16
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:12,620
of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that when internet service</font>

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:16,970
provider gives you a before dress this

18
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:19,370
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only one public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address and if</font>

19
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:24,320
you try to connect to the internal

20
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:26,900
network outside outside of it like let's

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,839
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's you're at work or you're an Air</font>

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:35,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">Force on my god</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I each set up something</font>

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:37,700
like 44 day or VPN so we need to I go

24
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:42,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">inside the router and twiddle around</font>

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:45,020
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> settings and then if if that's a is</font>

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,760
you pour your poor number changes then

27
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:53,530
you had to go back inside your router

28
00:01:46,760 --> 00:02:00,470
and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so I give you six</font>

29
00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:03,140
actually in the v6 RFC the requirement

30
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:08,568
that you internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> service provider will</font>

31
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:12,049
give you a / 64 allocation so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll use</font>

32
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:15,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a dress it's it's 128 bits so that</font>

33
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:18,380
means you have due to the 128 addresses

34
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:22,430
total and then if somebody gives just

35
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:29,450
64 location that means you have to to

36
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:32,810
the 64 public routable<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses so if</font>

37
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:37,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do the math 2 to the 3 2 that's for</font>

38
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:41,180
roughly four billion right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we know</font>

39
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:43,610
that's around nine zeros right so if we

40
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:52,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">multiply 4 billion cells for billions</font>

41
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:57,080
that's around oh but that's around 18

42
00:02:52,810 --> 00:03:00,590
that's around 18 the<font color="#E5E5E5"> zeroth right so</font>

43
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:04,670
that's a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of IP addresses that</font>

44
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:08,090
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are public and these</font>

45
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:10,790
things it's it's actually a it's not

46
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:14,330
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> being allowed to use it's just out</font>

47
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,980
there and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's already</font>

48
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:20,030
configured in all of our computers

49
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:22,760
automatically already and it's it's just

50
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:27,170
it's out there but we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really use</font>

51
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:31,220
it so the two ways you can actually us

52
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:34,519
as users as<font color="#CCCCCC"> host users can get districts</font>

53
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:38,150
addresses is through native support to

54
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:45,680
our ISP or through a tunnel techniques

55
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:48,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh so let's will actually look at what</font>

56
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,910
percentage of users actually ipv6

57
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:56,410
enabled so um this is our<font color="#CCCCCC"> char</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I took in</font>

58
00:03:52,910 --> 00:04:01,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">a couple days ago of the from google and</font>

59
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:03,620
it shows you a way out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the people</font>

60
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:06,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that visit Google what percentage of</font>

61
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,990
them have v6 enables so what percentage

62
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:11,030
are actually using v6 addresses and you

63
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:14,810
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the total</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number is only seven</font>

64
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:17,930
point four percent and it's broken down

65
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:21,970
into native and its own nickname so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

66
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see most people are using needs</font>

67
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:37,659
oh so in the way the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> public</font>

68
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,460
addresses allocated is there's usually

69
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:42,229
there's five different organizations

70
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:46,698
around the world that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives give out</font>

71
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:50,628
these addresses and the one that we must

72
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:54,169
hear about our airing and right<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin is</font>

73
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:56,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">the one functions in North America and</font>

74
00:04:54,169 --> 00:05:03,560
ripe is the one that's functions mostly

75
00:04:56,599 --> 00:05:06,190
in Europe<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so these are called</font>

76
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,229
regional internet registries and then

77
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:12,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">local internet registries are their</font>

78
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:15,940
customers so they're get their of they

79
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:19,698
get the assignments and then they either

80
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:22,759
allocate these assignments to their

81
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:31,250
customers which is us or they assigned

00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:52,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">quests for instance in June have been</font>

87
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:56,000
around 2061 the number of requests are

88

the number of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 allocations have</font>

only been a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 26-inch in so you can see</font>

90
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:07,219
that number<font color="#E5E5E5"> is much lower so on the on</font>

the left hand side<font color="#E5E5E5"> on thur on the right</font>

94
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:26,090
it shows that the blue line is the

95
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:29,448
number of ice piece that are already

96
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:32,210
have a do is fax so they give both v4

97
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:34,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">and v6 address and the red line</font>

98
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,680
represents the number of ice keys that

99
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:39,169
only give out of you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dress</font>

100
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:46,460
so you can see the trend is moving

101
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:49,639
towards the v4 v6 go<font color="#CCCCCC"> stack ah so comcast</font>

102
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:52,820
which is probably one of the leading I

103
00:06:49,639 --> 00:07:00,889
skis out there is now starting to roll

104
00:06:52,820 --> 00:07:06,009
out a dual V for vista solution so on

105
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:09,380
there on the website the in late 2013

106
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:13,389
they had a statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point five</font>

107
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:19,520
percent of their customers have our

108
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:21,770
support dual be 46 addresses so it's my

109
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,990
assumption that since then the number

110
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">has increased much much larger to the</font>

111
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:29,690
point where now in the region of

112
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:35,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">Delaware maybe Maryland our comcast</font>

113
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:35,919
offers a duel before research saw stack

114
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,490
so if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out if if you're</font>

115
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:47,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">a comcast customer and you want to find</font>

116
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:51,979
out if you have esox enabled what you

117
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:55,370
can do is you can check your<font color="#E5E5E5"> modem</font>

118
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:59,180
online to see whether it's b6 enabled so

119
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:02,530
you would go<font color="#E5E5E5"> this website see if there's</font>

120
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:05,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">a check mark next to modem and if it is</font>

121
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:08,539
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do is you unplug you nap in</font>

122
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:13,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">that box for your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> router you throw</font>

123
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:19,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhere and you put you you connect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

124
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:22,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">computer directly to to you modem and if</font>

125
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:27,620
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> mystics address you should get</font>

126
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:29,419
of old / 128 address and then up their

127
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,570
websites online where you can check to

128
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:37,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sick status so if you go to just ipv6</font>

129
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:41,390
com it will tell you if your v6 is

130
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:44,810
hooked up ready to go so it'll give you

131
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:46,670
some information about our your ice P

132
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,520
and then you can further you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do a</font>

133
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,240
ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> steps to google to see where</font>

134
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:57,230
they're coming to

135
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:59,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">ah so but this side this address</font>

136
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:05,029
actually is only on 128 so if you want

137
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:11,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a slash show 64 address then you</font>

138
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:16,220
can buy a cheap product from ebay and

139
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:20,870
you can turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 from there but now</font>

140
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:24,520
that router has to have v6 capabilities

141
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:28,160
so it has to be hot v6 capable so a

142
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:32,000
dlink router we turn it on it'll have

143
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:37,100
Jewish beauties wish Oh with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the slash</font>

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:44,110
lak 28<font color="#CCCCCC"> and / 0 64</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dress I'm not sure if</font>

145
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:44,110
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see this is this okay alone</font>

146
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:54,529
k thanks to this slightly at the ATM<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes</font>

147
00:09:52,130 --> 00:10:02,510
so here you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this is the /</font>

148
00:09:54,529 --> 00:10:09,610
64 address yes so this actually this is

149
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:13,550
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've config and my computer so you can</font>

150
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:16,130
you can see here that this is a / 64

151
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,899
address so that means we have four

152
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:21,470
buildings jumps four billion address

153
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:23,990
that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use that are public so if</font>

154
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:27,560
contest does not give you a district

155
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:30,800
just yet or if using another I ski you

156
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:36,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">can still get a v6 address using a</font>

157
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:40,310
tunneling so um here are you can see in

158
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,950
the cloud there is a 541 column 10 point

159
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:46,699
of presence ah and these are different

160
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:49,010
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts are presences that are just</font>

161
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:57,620
out there they're free that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can um</font>

162
00:10:49,010 --> 00:11:03,240
just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> crane account login ah and use so</font>

163
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:04,770
um and then you can see inside

164
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,540
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to have a gay way of</font>

165
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:13,079
some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you gain way is your tunnel</font>

166
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:15,930
endpoint so you gave where you have a

167
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:19,050
platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> on calling to address and then</font>

168
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:23,399
on the on another interface towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

169
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:26,430
internal network you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> another v6</font>

170
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:29,370
address like let's say here the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Simon is</font>

171
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:31,109
a five more bottom one so that the

172
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:38,610
district dresses are actually given to

173
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:42,410
you by your turning vendor so the the

174
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:46,830
two lovely know about that we use are a

175
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:50,850
hurricane electric are and they actually

176
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:53,880
they can give you 48 prefix to if you

177
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:56,580
request it so that's if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set</font>

178
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:59,339
up v6 networks inside all the v6

179
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:04,550
networks sing have an even bigger

180
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:08,370
address space on a dome camera is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

181
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:11,609
when you sell a tunnel with hurricane

182
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:14,790
electric the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gateway needs to be I to</font>

183
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:18,329
team Z zone of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> router because it's</font>

184
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:21,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">just that it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> native</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 16-4 tunnel so</font>

185
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:25,380
you use just regular linux someone

186
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:29,300
technique but<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be actually</font>

187
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:33,570
publicly accessible the other of

188
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:38,609
tunneling provider is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know of is six</font>

189
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:40,440
and you can actually do the tunneling

190
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,839
without touching the router so you need

191
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,950
to put anything in GMC and it actually

192
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:52,770
here dials out to your point of presence

193
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:54,779
to you Bob oh and he also has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a heart</font>

194
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:57,810
beating technique work if you have a

195
00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:00,839
dynamic ipv4 address from your isp that

196
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:05,969
changes constantly this hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

197
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:19,440
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> done address a remotely so that</font>

198
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:22,980
it always shocked when you are so so if

199
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,100
you are so you can actually don't need

200
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,449
to have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gateway</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the router</font>

201
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,449
separate you can consolidate the

202
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:33,750
consolidate them into one device so for

203
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:37,079
me I have a I have a old router probably

204
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:39,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">about seven years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and it doesn't</font>

205
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:45,170
have your<font color="#CCCCCC"> sick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> support so what I did was</font>

206
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:49,199
I update the<font color="#CCCCCC"> firmware</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to open wrt and I</font>

207
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:54,029
downloaded the six client which is

208
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:59,609
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> I IQ so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just do not own and</font>

209
00:13:54,029 --> 00:14:01,260
ill you still generate a<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 address for</font>

210
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:03,089
you you'll give you the ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> six address</font>

211
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:10,770
that you can then using internal network

212
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:14,839
and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> address 85 85 for 1.1 you</font>

213
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:19,290
need to start we assign that both in

214
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:21,270
this in this scenario<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in the Austin</font>

215
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:25,709
area each action manually assigns to

216
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:31,050
dress and uh you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up</font>

217
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:34,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">forwarding in your gateway and set up</font>

218
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:38,399
the appropriate firewall rules for v6

219
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:41,219
forwarding when do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on your internal</font>

220
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:46,500
interface are you to start of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> ATV</font>

221
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:49,649
which is Gus rock dust an erotic

222
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:54,360
advertisements and that's a stainless or

223
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:57,180
configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> then then the internal</font>

224
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,990
devices will receive and that will

225
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,729
automatically get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a v6 address so the</font>

226
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:05,250
clients<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to do</font>

227
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:09,000
anything it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a light it's like a</font>

228
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:10,620
lightweight dhcp server except<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

229
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,660
clients they don't actually run engage

230
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,270
to be fine they just automatically get

231
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:19,630
us addresses and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is called</font>

232
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:26,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">our slack stainless or configurations</font>

233
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:30,430
so when you get these addresses you

234
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:33,040
usually get two addresses oh and the

235
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,260
first address is it's actually derived

236
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:40,390
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mac dress so you can see up</font>

237
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:43,720
top that my the first districts address

238
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:46,900
is is similar to the mac address and if

239
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,060
actually from that address<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can guess</font>

240
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:52,510
what you can derive what the mac dress

241
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:54,790
is so obviously this is a security issue

242
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:57,640
because if you're using a diff you

243
00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:00,790
source ipv6 address and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then some good</font>

244
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,530
as some server is listening that traffic

245
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:05,349
you can see what the source address is

246
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:07,540
and then he can derive the mac dress and

247
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:10,810
he can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually track down each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> user</font>

248
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:14,829
because you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> always have that a g6</font>

249
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:19,260
address so you can enable promised

250
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:22,480
extensions that will generate a random

251
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:26,410
v6 the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dress that is then used by</font>

252
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:29,200
default so you can see the second

253
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:32,800
address is a random<font color="#CCCCCC"> address and then if</font>

254
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:38,070
you ping google oh that will be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad</font>

255
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:43,810
the default address that's being used so

256
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:47,670
can able this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux and sis et al you</font>

257
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:52,449
would um you would turn this on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

258
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:55,360
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the the arch linux</font>

259
00:16:52,450 --> 00:17:00,880
wiki suggest that you turn the other two

260
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:02,950
of options own however what i did<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i</font>

261
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,290
understand i got a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

262
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:08,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these six addresses which is</font>

263
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:10,629
ok but I mean you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of like she</font>

264
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:16,689
like five or six<font color="#E5E5E5"> different v6 addresses</font>

265
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:18,600
all of a sudden but those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just so</font>

266
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:24,510
still being used rather than Europe

267
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:27,698
address the sea<font color="#CCCCCC"> rock</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from you Mac so oh</font>

268
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:32,480
not a cool feature that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

269
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:35,660
you guys aware of is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> irr</font>

270
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,390
earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrived it actually provides you</font>

271
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,340
a web interface through which you can

272
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:43,130
check<font color="#CCCCCC"> your productivity and this is</font>

273
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:46,549
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is both for v4</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and v6</font>

274
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:50,330
which you can do what you do is you upon

275
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:54,860
line and they give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> this probe which</font>

278

it doesn't do anything except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for when</font>

00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:07,280
someone right issues our request for a

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:30,290
traceroute pro from all over the world

285
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:33,860
from these little<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices all over the</font>

286
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:36,470
world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they will probe of my address</font>

287
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:39,168
you know whether they connect to it so

288
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:42,350
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see here that they have</font>

289
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:46,640
addresses from from Italy from Japan

290
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:48,949
from Germany and then you can click any

291
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:53,630
of them and you can see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traceroute</font>

292
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:56,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">trace so it's really cool thing oh</font>

293
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:59,330
there's two youtube videos that I

294
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,010
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it the second</font>

295
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:06,500
one talks more about the infrastructure

296
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:08,090
and how to set up because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the website</font>

297
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,070
election very very nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very</font>

298
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,629
responsible and very interactive so it's

299
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:20,330
kind of interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see how all that</font>

300
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:22,730
data is be generated so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are of</font>

301
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,730
course security implementations when

302
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:29,450
something becomes more complicated

303
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:32,990
because more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security issue and</font>

304
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:36,620
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for anything so when we look</font>

305
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:39,380
at ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to look at from our</font>

306
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:42,949
users perspective so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a home user</font>

307
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:46,429
and I'm running v6 uh what can happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

308
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:49,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">me what should I be aware of well so</font>

309
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:54,049
if I'd say my father walks in into my

310
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:55,639
house and gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> a v6 address uh then he</font>

311
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:58,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't is not aware of that you know</font>

312
00:19:55,639 --> 00:20:00,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's just has a v6 address and it's a</font>

313
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:03,379
public address of anybody else could

314
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:08,740
attack so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can</font>

315
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:11,928
do is that we can serve a VLAN on the

316
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,720
internal interface so that only people

317
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:17,480
that are on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that VLAN can get a v6</font>

318
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:22,460
address so that will mitigate the issue

319
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:27,200
and a private<font color="#E5E5E5"> extension probably need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

320
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:32,499
turn on<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah and you guys know snore and</font>

321
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:36,470
PSS actually support b6 so you can

322
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:41,690
enable a traces through snore in

323
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:47,899
distance and you can generate<font color="#CCCCCC"> a white</font>

324
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:49,639
list of all your devices so all the

325
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:53,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">devices know about this can be done</font>

326
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:55,490
actually with GC version<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 probably can</font>

327
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:59,929
be done with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> ATV that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I showed</font>

328
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:01,789
earlier because you need to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> only be</font>

329
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:08,360
six addresses to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the host device which</font>

330
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:13,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know ah so I showed earlier that you</font>

331
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:18,110
can set up a v6 gateway in your network

332
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:21,230
so let's imagine a scenario where you

333
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:23,449
have unsecured access point and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

334
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:29,200
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in to network hak-su</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> box</font>

335
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:31,970
and then starts up something like IQ and

336
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,009
hands out v6 addresses to everybody

337
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:36,259
internal network what would happen is

338
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:39,649
that the traffic will pass to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass</font>

339
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:41,509
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> that rope node and you bicker it</font>

340
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:44,779
would become a man in the middle so that

341
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:51,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">he can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> view modify the traffic do</font>

342
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:53,840
anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he wants with it so if you</font>

343
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:56,749
if you really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

344
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,070
guess you can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can turn off v6</font>

345
00:21:56,749 --> 00:22:02,050
which is it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like what we do</font>

346
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:05,169
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ice department does that mean</font>

347
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:08,010
versatile where I think like based on

348
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:12,880
what I've talked about some people and

349
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:19,390
you can you can detect new districts

350
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:23,800
addresses the comma of you to do that

351
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:26,590
you if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> f of 0 to the</font>

352
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">multicast address and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into specified</font>

353
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:31,870
that interfere<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're going out of</font>

354
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:35,490
you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> all your district suggests</font>

355
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:38,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">them network and then you can generate a</font>

356
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:39,760
wireless for your devices that are on

357
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:43,510
there and if you see a new one you can

358
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:48,400
tell them you can ban them from

359
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:52,390
connection all right and there's also a

360
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:58,260
really cool utilities at from the

361
00:22:52,390 --> 00:23:01,750
hackers choice it's they have stuff like

362
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:09,060
finding out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sick suggestions on</font>

363
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:09,060
your network i doing v6 flooding<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh-oh</font>

364
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:15,340
sending men the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tax would be</font>

365
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:23,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">six and stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got up there's a lot of</font>

366
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:25,240
stuff out there and so the thing would

367
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:29,379
be six is that it's a lot more

368
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,450
complicated than<font color="#E5E5E5"> before it's it's more</font>

369
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:34,030
than just addressing<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's actually</font>

370
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,100
some protocol stuff going<font color="#CCCCCC"> online so it's</font>

371
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:42,149
important to educate yourself about you

372
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:42,149
six and<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what capabilities are I'll</font>

373
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:51,700
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> before or if still covered the</font>

374
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:54,370
natick needs don't high schools but can

375
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:58,750
still get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network so you need</font>

376
00:23:54,370 --> 00:24:03,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get into the habit of assuming that</font>

377
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:05,320
this internal of knowledge are

378
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:07,740
eventually going to be public of and

379
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:11,230
against the technique of being able to

380
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:14,350
secure them correctly

381
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:18,120
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple is my talk if you have any</font>

382
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:18,120
questions I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to take them</font>

383
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,610
you
