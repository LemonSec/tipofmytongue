the thing hit an hour time slot so one

15
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:48,170
thing I didn't do that was a nice intro

144
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,700

that more later so why the heck well

147
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,810
here I guess here's a good point I can

148
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,210
take this off it if you guys want to see

149
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,560
how I built this thing let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just get</font>

150

151
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,020

152
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:28,530
battery wired don't take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out and pick</font>

163
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:23,680
so why did I build this thing well maybe

164
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,719
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm an actor when I search for</font>

165
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,110
pictures does it pick the hacker this

166
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,490
was one of the person came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> in so I</font>

167
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,070
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russian extra</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cord to the</font>

168
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:37,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">psycho so I don't maybe in Russia they</font>

169
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,500
have to wear those masses to keep warm

170
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,990
really this kind of hacker hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

171
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,900
seen this picture before so why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

172
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:49,380
guy a hacker is it because in the

173
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:52,170
picture of firefly the background or

174
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,880
head or I think it's because of the

175
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,579
shirt not because of the shirt just

176
00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:00,660
because of what the shirt implies relax

177
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:03,570
I can fix it so I like challenges I like

178
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:06,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be able to overcome obstacles and</font>

179
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:09,150
that enables me to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like build</font>

180
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:12,120
a CTF inside of the Hat be a system

181
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:15,180
administrator take your own things on my

182

the better of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so so what</font>

190
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:09,550
about the Hat itself I really the

191
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:11,840
original goal here was so in 2014

192
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,120
they're behind this contest called

193
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,770
hacker derby where people would build

194
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,120
their beasts Azul interesting things

195
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,189
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one does and there was a</font>

196
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,710
contest where you can enter in Africa

197
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:24,730
with you whatever it sound like a misty

198
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:27,320
was it whiskey yeah I ran<font color="#E5E5E5"> a contest and</font>

199
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:30,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">Josh Brown writing it this year it's</font>

200
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,600
your fault point my next point is I put

201
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">this league the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Derby con not realizing</font>

202
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,560
that the contest wasn't on this year I

203
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,750
couldn't go this year I heard there was

204
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,459
a baby involved yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> likewise I asked</font>

205
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:43,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">for other people to step up on the cob</font>

206
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,650
nobody hit right nobody stepped up no I

207
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,720
wasn't there and so it wasn't launched

208
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:50,030
but the first year we ran classic your

209
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,460
office last year we had whiskey we had

210
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:54,560
gift cards at approve amazon streetcar

211
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,050
get a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> good prizes we have some</font>

212
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,589
good so good hack derbies nothing like

213
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:03,380
this but I was deadly poison it was no

214
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,450
contest so yeah this is why I went if

215
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,460
there if I go next<font color="#E5E5E5"> year and there is a</font>

216
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:09,200
contest well then just beat the elephant

217
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,030
good well this year we're hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

218
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,410
build an even better dango we have to

219
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,319
decide what that's going to be in but

220
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:18,170
fill out of

221
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:20,839
they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not hang</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out but anyway so the</font>

222
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,069
idea was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enter in the contest but it</font>

223
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,350
will also it sound like a fun thing to

224
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:26,569
build what we heard about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the contest in</font>

225
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:29,649
2014 this is what we thought people were

226
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:32,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be bringing we thought you know</font>

227
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:34,459
computing and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hat-trick engine because</font>

228
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,839
it's sort of defeat right there a

229
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:38,599
contested red theme or whatever then

230
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,579
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get together so when the contest</font>

231
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,290
wasn't on I mean honestly if I occurred

232
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:44,239
before we got there that it wasn't on I

233
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,730
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have built</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

234
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,480
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a fun project so for comparison</font>

235
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:53,120
2014 the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two winners were one was dr.</font>

236
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">Berrick build a mobile whiskey</font>

237
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,259
distribution system yep on his hat

238
00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:03,319
including ice and and soda and what time

239
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:06,589
and the other winner was integral who

240
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:09,800
built a sound activated light display

241
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:11,480
using le wire y el wire PL area but it

242
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,920
was a great great girl he built it all

243
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,199
out the conference and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

244
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,670
put together very neat and worked

245
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:20,469
wonderfully so those are the two winners

246
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:23,420
I think if this was there in 2014 and I

247
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:27,079
don't have any money<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so the company</font>

248
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:29,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes right so the actually got to talk to</font>

249
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">you in a row while we were there he said</font>

250
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,160
he was planning on building

251
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,540
at with a plasma speaker<font color="#E5E5E5"> gift Oh for</font>

252
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,949
this year but when you found out the

253
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,439
contest polls and all you decide is the

254
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:40,149
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> for next year so anybody who's</font>

258
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,580
on topic here so but most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all I</font>

259
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:55,209
thought they<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be a fun challenge</font>

260
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:57,700
try to do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I recommend so</font>

261
00:12:55,209 --> 00:13:02,219
this was what my office looked<font color="#CCCCCC"> like at</font>

262
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,220
work for the better part of two<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font>

263
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,990
so rich and I meet<font color="#E5E5E5"> new people eating at</font>

264
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end of his legally at first it was</font>

265
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:13,330
bi weekly and we could try to work

266
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:15,010
through all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these various problems the</font>

267
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:19,240
college was kind enough to put up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

268
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:22,120
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fund the project so at the end</font>

269
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:25,240
we probably spent I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 600 bucks</font>

270
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,400
or so on partisan and everything every

271
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,200
we figured it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> intellect</font>

272
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:33,420
yeah that one definitely get to pass

273
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:37,470
three other times too rich you're smart

274
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:39,630
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry so anyway we had couple</font>

275
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,550
goals<font color="#E5E5E5"> going into an a you know we wanted</font>

276
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,520
this let me this idea for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the platform</font>

277
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:46,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">came right after terrific on 2014 we're</font>

278
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,150
like on the ride home from Louisville in

279
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,270
Pennsylvania talking about what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

280
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:57,900
do with this thing didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start</font>

281

building<font color="#CCCCCC"> it until june or so they anyway</font>

282
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,939
so we had a couple goals first goal was

283
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,910
we wanted two things run self-contained

284
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,080
on battery power for up to 16 hours we

285
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,699
ended up a lot higher than that the

286
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,980
battery that we bought<font color="#E5E5E5"> was got us like</font>

287
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,690
closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 30 hours so it might bit</font>

288
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,180
overkill next time we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably do</font>

289
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:17,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">it smaller better and save some room in</font>

290
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,290
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> head the second thing we wanted to</font>

291
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,449
be able to recharge<font color="#CCCCCC"> that battery within</font>

292
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,680
six hours because basically you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

293
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,540
get eight hours of sleep deter become

294
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,579
the most conferences because you're out

295
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,099
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people party or whatever</font>

296
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:31,180
until will be ours and they get some

297
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,000
sleep in and get up for the 8am cause

298
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,739
morning so we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we wanted it</font>

299
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,090
to not be made a ton of heat<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font>

300
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,970
had to wear these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our heads</font>

301
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:42,070
and we wanted the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dss as aesthetically</font>

302
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,720
pleasing as positive as you can see

303
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,430
other than the screen this one just

304
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,560
looks like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30 there's no holes for</font>

305
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,270
ventilation there's no we toyed with the

306
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,619
idea of an external<font color="#CCCCCC"> antenna just to draw</font>

307
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:54,579
some attention to it but we decided

308
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:56,110
again and the third goal which came up

309
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,030
closer to the end was we wanted to think

310
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,940
the field as much like an appliance as

311
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:04,030
possible which was wake up plug it in

312
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:06,550
wait for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to boot up and go no</font>

313
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:07,870
Tanqueray no you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected for my</font>

314
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">laptop and make sure that all the</font>

315
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,960
scripts are running and whatever so I

316
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,660
put a lot of work into making sure that

317
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:17,320
everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing ran either ran</font>

318
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:19,120
at boot time or was a service that the

319
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,210
OS<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the record pi could just start at</font>

320
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,980
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time or that it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was somehow time</font>

321
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:27,460
which was the only time the only thing

322
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:29,670
we ran into the morning we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaving</font>

323
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:33,130
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> dirty pond we turn on our hats</font>

324
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:34,839
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sort of a last check and there</font>

325
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:38,140
was a special moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the display</font>

326
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:40,450
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> indie keeping time called party</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

327
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">the thing play something other than its</font>

328
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:46,540
usual<font color="#CCCCCC"> advertise loop for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the parties</font>

329
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">that occur at their begun and we turn on</font>

330
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,630
the hats in their Bolton<font color="#E5E5E5"> party</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vote</font>

331
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,790
because when we turned them off last

332
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,800
time I was testing party modes at the

333
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:57,550
time still thought the thing was there

334
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,170
was a time set in the script that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actor</font>

335
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,829
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> he and night and going to party</font>

336
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:04,339
mode and turn off at<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 2am morning</font>

337
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:06,680
right it turns out there's no battery of

338
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,840
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Raspberry Pi it can't keep time when</font>

339
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,430
it's turned off so every morning we had

340
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:14,540
to turn it on any connections are set

341
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:16,609
the time but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that was minor so</font>

342
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,290
the last thing that we needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

343
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure was why early poppies thing</font>

344
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,920
wireless range because if you want

345
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,880
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to connect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

346
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,880
you need not right

347
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey so we wanted to be able to cover in</font>

348
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,140
a single conference room so picture a

349
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,520
room like this size you wanted to make

350
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,920
sure the other guy in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back corner</font>

351
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:46,540
two still together you try to get up

352
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:48,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">each other and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that God</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

353
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:52,390
a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> wireless USB wireless adapter</font>

354
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:54,160
that mean that in there so some

355
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,840
highlights about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we ended up</font>

356
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">putting it again so we use the Raspberry</font>

357
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,930
Pi a plus because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's small pretty</font>

358
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:05,109
compact form factor he has pretty low

359
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:06,669
power consumption and it's got a single

360
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:08,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">USB port which is all we thought we</font>

361
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:12,040
needed we ended up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the USB pub for</font>

362
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:16,390
power reasons because I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> winter then</font>

363
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:18,639
this point honestly we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had read that the</font>

364
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:21,760
power supply in the Raspberry Pi it was

365
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,460
a little bit big right so the output to

366
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,800
the USB<font color="#E5E5E5"> power the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US power the wide wide</font>

367
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,030
adapter we heard sometimes maybe was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

368
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">little with all the older models of</font>

369
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:32,980
whatever that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the output voltage of</font>

370
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,110
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> USB was not always safe so we</font>

371
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:38,530
decided it was better to have a powered

372
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:41,590
USB hub so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we calculate is the</font>

373
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:43,870
battery powers the USB phone which then

374
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,209
powers the Raspberry Pi which then the

375
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:48,580
Raspberry Pi next back to

376
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,960
the wireless of effort which is sounded

377
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,570
crazy I was surprised that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

378
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,970
but it did because the input of<font color="#CCCCCC"> pi is</font>

379
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:58,720
just power the output<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the PI standard</font>

380
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:01,510
USB so<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever we worked out the next</font>

381
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,120
thing was obviously the display ended up

382
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:06,940
with a 16 x 2 character<font color="#CCCCCC"> OLEDs of a</font>

383
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,860
different we went with LED because it

384
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,809
lights up really nice makes it easy to

385
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:16,029
see and it's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower power</font>

386
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:19,479
consumption Billy CD

387
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:21,580
so USB hub where<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about we've it</font>

388
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:25,029
up with an hour link Wi-Fi adapter from

389
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:27,789
Adafruit just because everyone said work

390
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:31,690
well my bed<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raskin software we ended up</font>

391
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:34,450
with wood man so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that wasn't going to be</font>

392
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:37,809
a problem and we ended up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 20,000</font>

393
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,940
milliamp hour battery which by the way

394
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:42,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can get a 20,000 milliamp hour</font>

395
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,049
battery for powering some things like

396
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:47,229
cell phones and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot all of amazon</font>

397
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:49,479
for a walking sixteen dollars which I

398
00:18:47,229 --> 00:18:51,009
was florida i found that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found out</font>

399
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:54,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">later that that's because the thing only</font>

400
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:56,739
output one out and it only it only

401
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:58,179
equally charge it upon it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we thought</font>

402
00:18:56,739 --> 00:19:00,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be a huge problem for a</font>

403
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:02,200
charging but it ended up that because we

404
00:19:00,129 --> 00:19:06,099
had over built the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so much it was</font>

405
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:09,190
still able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to charge not overnight so</font>

406
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:11,710
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all the interest rate on the</font>

407
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,749
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is a picture of me in for more</font>

408
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:17,320
batteries park book three so we have

409
00:19:13,749 --> 00:19:18,729
spare really needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to before one farm</font>

410
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,649
to see if we can take the batteries out

411
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:22,059
of it and mount that in the hat instead

412
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:23,918
of just keeping it inside of the

413
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:25,539
container that it's already<font color="#E5E5E5"> in we</font>

414
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">decided against that afterward but i had</font>

415
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,330
already toured the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing apart</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at that</font>

416
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:30,839
point so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought hey let's put a</font>

417
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,839
picture in there

418
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:40,919
Oh

419
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,530
okay so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other picture is the back of</font>

420
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:49,280
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only display so you see these tiny</font>

421
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:52,350
little specks that you might call resist

422
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,440
maybe you already single put these

423
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:58,379
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> a delivery</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen so we</font>

424
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">get originally read yeah you can use</font>

425
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,970
over the new displays<font color="#CCCCCC"> with raspy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

426
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:06,570
this cool python library all you have to

427
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:08,940
do is run your your display in espiando

428
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,740
just cereal that's compared to parallel

429
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,320
mode which comes in with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> body thing</font>

430
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,760
and all you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do do that is move a</font>

431
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,600
couple of these tiny little speck

432
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:21,120
resistors so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought okay rich has</font>

433
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,889
some experience with soldering he

434
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,629
actually runs in class at a local

435
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:30,720
community college that deals with using

436
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:32,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">three no number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or Guido's and LCD</font>

437
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,080
displays so he has to experience the

438
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,310
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal so we fought our I mean three</font>

439
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,340
TV because he<font color="#E5E5E5"> moves</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things around</font>

440
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:40,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work so we read some</font>

441
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,909
more documentation and the documentation

442
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:45,750
doesn't match will be found from the

443
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:49,110
spec sheet media the LED display and the

444
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:51,000
the guy who wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the is though how</font>

445
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:53,399
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that through following his pictures</font>

446
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,800
didn't actually telling us to do so we

447
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,030
ended up just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying we're going to put</font>

448
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,740
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to parallel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> movement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

449
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,750
happen so we put the thing back to

450
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,790
parallel mode so rich not only had to

451
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,280
surface mount solder once he had his

452
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:06,540
then move it all back so on the second

453
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,720
display we bought it we didn't involve

454
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,720
me

455
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,310
thank you

456
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:21,820
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more about the the woes</font>

457
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:27,940
with the display as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

458
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:29,918
software side of things right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

459
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,850
because i had this slide of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinetics</font>

460
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:36,340
shouldn't spoil this was another

461
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:37,840
challenge this having been the first

462
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,389
project<font color="#CCCCCC"> either had done with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a raspberry</font>

463
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,668
pi we were supposed to read<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in</font>

464
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:44,619
apps on how to connect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> display to</font>

465
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:46,869
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pie it was a lot of confusion</font>

466
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:48,908
because the numbering on the pin block

467
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:52,149
for the raspberry pi the numbering for

468
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:54,129
the GPIO pins it there seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be lots</font>

469
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:56,768
of methods to number these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

470
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:59,379
unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have all of your pieces are</font>

471
00:21:56,769 --> 00:22:00,070
using the same method obviously you end

472
00:21:59,379 --> 00:22:04,179
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the wrong</font>

473
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:05,950
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we we decided to show</font>

474
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:09,600
the physical pins so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:12,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">physical pain on the olee which were</font>

476
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,490
those little blocks you see at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top</font>

477
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:19,390
rich has<font color="#CCCCCC"> solder</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with some hints</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:23,140

00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:26,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">connected them to and of course what</font>

481
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:28,420
that came does right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is the on</font>

482
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,699
the Raspberry Pi side of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin dubs I</font>

483
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,350
did you feel it necessary to enumerate

484
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,660
what they do on the

485
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:37,459
but if you decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build one of these</font>

486
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,710
things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use the library that we</font>

487
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,740
use this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin opportunity and all</font>

488
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:44,090
of this is in a blog entry that I wrote

489
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:49,370
that'll be that's already available in

490
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:52,600
the last slide in the presentation so

491
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:55,370
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next thing is the software</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> itself</font>

492
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,659
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can take off for 21 it's</font>

493
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">likely to do a hat you don't have</font>

494
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:02,210
software to make it all work together

495
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:04,879
all you have is a head and stuff so on

496
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:07,490
the Raspberry Pi we're running raspy and

497
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:11,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">weezy because it was the latest that was</font>

498
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:13,610
available at time<font color="#CCCCCC"> jessie was released I</font>

499
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:17,000
think or soon to be released but go easy

500
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:19,100
because they also how good that I was

501
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,340
reading on how to get dhcpd and post a

502
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:25,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">PD and what not working he was easy so I</font>

503
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:30,409
figured whatever of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're using</font>

504
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:35,840
hostapd and dhcp that hosts the wireless

505
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:38,150
access point<font color="#CCCCCC"> I gave dhcpd 65,000 IP</font>

506
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,909
addresses which in hindsight was over

507
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:44,150
killed the conference only has like 13

508
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:46,580
thousand people there become<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is so</font>

509
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:48,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">I probably didn't need so many IPS I</font>

510
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,629
also set the least time out to evolve in

511
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,120
one minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> because again I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't</font>

512
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,290
know what to<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect can I didn't</font>

513
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,909
run<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leases in the middle of the</font>

514
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:56,460
conference because you know they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

515
00:23:54,910 --> 00:24:00,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">dollar leases and people were</font>

516
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:02,950
disconnecting recognizing whatever the

517
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,570
AP I did not put any sort of encryption

518
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:07,000
on it I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> put any kind of password</font>

519
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:09,790
you didn't have to try to break the AP

520
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,620
was there to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you access to the dirt</font>

521
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:13,450
it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> meant to be a challenge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

522
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:17,979
meant to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be connected as thing and there</font>

523
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:21,420
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are and that of course lots of</font>

524
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,420
Python to tie all this stuff together

525
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,970
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge we had to overcome</font>

526
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,590
software-wise was the actual library to

527
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:34,140
control the oil that you display so you

528
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:37,439
can see it's upside<font color="#CCCCCC"> down it doesn't</font>

529
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:39,960
waiting there to oriented here so you

530
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,370
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the display because it's like</font>

531
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,650
just doing things<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't go pacman</font>

532
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:45,899
animation it displays on both lines

533
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:48,510
which you know but you buy a two-line le

534
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:53,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">OLEDs it's nice to be able to use both</font>

535
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:55,980
lines well be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> library that we found</font>

536
00:24:53,010 --> 00:25:00,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that someone had sort of big they took</font>

537
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:03,000
80 proof LCD display library and they

538
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:05,070
sort of hacked it around to work with

539
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,620
the olivine which was the matter of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

540
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:09,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">and a few other you know this does this</font>

541
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,699
function in this does that one there was

542
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,170
some things changed around but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

543
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,230
end of the day I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think just didn't work</font>

544
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:17,790
right it would only display one line

545
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:19,440
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was no easy way that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just do</font>

546
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,970
things like clear the display or reset

547
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,200
it there were functions there<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

548
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,640
didn't seem to work the way we wanted to

549
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">be couldn't position things on the</font>

550
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,990
display so you'll see that these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

551
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,880
show up centered there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was no function</font>

552
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,650
in this library to Center things on the

553
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,480
display I had to move things<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

554
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:37,560
manually in that half the time didn't

555
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,810
work the way it expected to so at the

556
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">columns we have a team of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people that</font>

557
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:43,620
did things like system and one of those

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,320
people is we call our systems programmer

559
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:49,320
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gun and when we took the</font>

560
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,929
library to him and we said Carl we have

<font color="#CCCCCC">this library</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's Python I know this</font>

565
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:02,789
there so he asked us for the spec sheet

566
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:06,250
for the oil ed we gave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to him and</font>

567
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:07,899
about six hours later he came back to us

568
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:12,940
and said hey I wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole new</font>

space your you may be limited by our

580
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:46,870

583
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:52,899
right so it's easy if you might have

584
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,059
several servers or a big hulking server

585

00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:04,480
raspberry PI's but not several so what I

589
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,459
ended up doing was as well with my

00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:12,220

593
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,950

doctor gives me the ability to run

several services on this little

because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other option would have been</font>

I run the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Raspberry Pi and all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

617
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,380
over to a bunch of penetration testers

618
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,480
and red teamers and you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking</font>

619
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,400
for trouble I feel like I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good sis</font>

620
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,200
admit I don't think I'm back to it I

621
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,410
don't know that anybody is that good<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

622
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,940
can just turn the host over in the way

00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:26,100
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would have needs needed to and</font>

624
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:29,640
not expect someone to just destroy them

625
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:31,649
so containers let me run things directly

626
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,860
on the host however they're contained

627
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:36,090
inside of selinux and what not to make

628
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,699
sure that you can't get outside of that

629
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:42,179
text service and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the mostest an</font>

630
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,260
operating system so that was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

631
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">breakthrough and I had to figure that</font>

632
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,900
one out early

633
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,330
otherwise this whole project would work

634
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,770
out the way it did so I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

635
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:52,020
the term it's like virtualization

636
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:54,120
plankton so instead of running a whole

637
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:57,090
operating system in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> container well</font>

638
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:00,449
sort of does but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a dozen uses</font>

00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:01,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> post is Colonel so there's no you</font>

640
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:04,049
know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to virtualize an</font>

641
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:07,250
entire our CPU memory I just need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

642
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:10,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you can use the curl you can use my</font>

643
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:12,480
use the hosts resources but only in

644
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:15,510
these compliments<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that was definitely</font>

645
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">really useful I had never heard of</font>

646
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,049
anybody running<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like dr. on a</font>

647
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:22,700
Raspberry Pi before but luckily<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found</font>

648
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:25,490
a guy and taken the source for<font color="#CCCCCC"> dr. and</font>

649
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:28,320
modified it to work on the cpu for the

650
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:31,620
record high which was great because

651
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,539
otherwise I never would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been so I</font>

652
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,709
had a compile daughter from source which

653
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:36,929
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something i haven't been to do in a</font>

654
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,850
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time luckily I've done these</font>

655
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:40,559
things before perfect it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big</font>

656
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,760
problem right now obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives me a</font>

657
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,530
nice little packages to install

658
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,340
everything so I may be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little rusty</font>

659
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:51,480
but I got through so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I</font>

660
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:53,730
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out what is scoring so if</font>

661
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,820
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit you're going to get</font>

662
00:29:53,730 --> 00:30:01,309
to 15 flags I need to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way to</font>

663
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:04,340
securely let you register your points

664
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:07,879
in a way that others can't just sort of

665
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:09,168
copy them so my first thought was okay

666
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:11,360
well we'll just internet connect the

667
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:12,769
Derby and then when you can apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

668
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,748
local run script or something and that

669
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:17,799
script will talk to the scoreboard and

670
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:20,210
it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 points well problem was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

671
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:22,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't find a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way that will likely get</font>

672
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:24,590
this thing to dinner I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought the two</font>

673
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:27,830
wireless adapters and maybe I could use

674
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:29,870
30 cons access points to give me consent

675
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:32,090
I thought well<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might not be</font>

676
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,619
refundable then I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh oh open</font>

677
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,879
access point on my phone and I'll just

678
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:37,158
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it that way I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I'll do it</font>

679
00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:39,350
periodically and have its<font color="#E5E5E5"> cache the</font>

680
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:41,809
scores and sentiment bursts later or

681
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:43,399
something and that didn't seem divided a

682
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:47,928
lot of it because even cell service

683
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:51,199
there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just packing today so</font>

684
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:55,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">I ended up with their the post structure</font>

685
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,779
where when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you when you got into one of</font>

686
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:58,549
those containers or<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of wives you can</font>

687
00:30:56,779 --> 00:31:00,139
give you a code and then you take that

688
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:03,200
code to an external scoreboard as you

689
00:31:00,139 --> 00:31:07,928
enter the code and then you 88 points so

690
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:11,570
that the next problem was shoulder sir

691
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:13,190
so if you've got your coat you're

692
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,389
happily going off to my scoreboard if

693
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:15,649
you type in your code and someone

694
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:17,439
happens to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your shoulder and</font>

695
00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:19,479
snap a picture or something right

696
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,509
at the end of your coat stop them<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

697
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">many with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sam</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fo all my score right and</font>

698
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:28,120
then they get the points without having

699
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:29,620
too many of the work i thought one

700
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,479
option could be i've got my wife in a

701
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,039
whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mistakes and then issue</font>

702
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,830
them to anybody didn't want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in</font>

703
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:38,408
the contest but that didn't seem like

<font color="#E5E5E5">the scale well can we take of all the</font>

707
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:48,250
see that looks really really hot<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

708
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:51,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">laughing so I came up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with codes like</font>

this either one time you spoke after you

710
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:56,080
enter this in the scoreboard is no

711
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:57,909
longer usable first half of the code is

712
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,158
the identifier for the flag you've got

713
00:31:57,909 --> 00:32:02,980
you to the second half the code is just

714
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,299
random that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I generated pre-generated a</font>

populated both<font color="#CCCCCC"> Derby's with giuseppe</font>

717
00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:13,269
decodes and the scoreboard and all these

00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:15,789
phones whenever one of these code was

719
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:17,830
generated and branded to somebody that

720
00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:19,720
was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that code would never be seen</font>

721
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:22,539
again until someone found in five

722
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,519
obviously but that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> never be</font>

723

725
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,649
when you enter to the scoreboard

726
00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:31,299
obviously the scoreboard would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

727
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:39,399

729
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:44,870
I need them need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find a way to put</font>

730
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:48,689
the codes in some sort of a day

731
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:51,268
so that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just steal my database</font>

732
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:54,779
and get all the codes right so doctor

733
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:57,720
has this the way of providing volumes so

734
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:59,909
picture the lighter blue box is the

that's the green arrow<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix so every</font>

744
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:19,889
container had a special directory in the

745
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,199
room and then inside of there there was

746
00:33:19,889 --> 00:33:24,870
a code fun and on the host<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was trying</font>

a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> line notify scripts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

748
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,809
whenever somebody would access one of

749
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:31,679
the code violence it would immediately

750
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:35,039
throw a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good coat of empire so when</font>

751
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,649
you're inside one of my containers and

752
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:40,408
you simply access the file that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has the</font>

753
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:42,570
coating on the host the iota phi would

754
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:44,580
say o someone touch that file<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll make</font>

755
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:45,899
a new one and throw it in there so if

756
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,059
you were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out where my</font>

757
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:50,399
code files were you can just dump a

758
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:51,779
bunch of codes if you wanted to luckily

759
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,340
the scoreboard with<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart that once</font>

760
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:56,850
you've registered quantum say you

761
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:59,189
registered this wagon it won't let<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">register for that flag ID ever again you</font>

763
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:03,269
can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep getting the 10 points</font>

764
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:05,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">things work over and over again and mess</font>

765
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:12,239
up scoring so that worked out pretty

766
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:12,750
well I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> so why put this life in</font>

767
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,428
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> place</font>

768
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,129
probably so instead of having to go back

769
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:19,050
to show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that good so the next thing</font>

770
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:23,029
was the score board itself now<font color="#E5E5E5"> again I'm</font>

771
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:25,470
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a web developer I'm assistant so i</font>

772
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:27,750
could have written a scoreboard it

773
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:30,029
probably wouldn't have any secure as a

774
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:32,489
web developer in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> head so I went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

775
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:33,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">the web development</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> team in yet and I</font>

776
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:35,428
asked them hey you may be a scoreboard

777
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:38,549
and they basically said yeah whatever

778
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:41,460
that's simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a web form with a</font>

779
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:43,230
display piece and they gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> me ec the</font>

780
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,520
tapas<font color="#CCCCCC"> go on at pad they gave me some</font>

781
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:46,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">place that i could put rules and</font>

782
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:49,230
whatever so this this starts to<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

783
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:53,909
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a professional seek again if you</font>

784
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:56,310
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> no idea was run by an amateur so</font>

785
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:57,840
the scoreboard was simple you put in

786
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:00,540
your username there was no registration

787
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:03,360
required you pop in here whatever using

788
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">a you wanted to display</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you pop in the</font>

789
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,910
code<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you were granted the</font>

790
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,320
scoreboard would say yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

791
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,520
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> good code use your points in to</font>

792
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:13,500
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> you on the scoreboard or would say</font>

793
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:16,280
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> not accepted does anyone know what</font>

794
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,280
that user but that you

795
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:23,609
anybody ready ready player one if you

796
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:27,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't you should it's an awesome love</font>

797
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:29,730
me anymore but also what curry so the

798
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:33,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">next thing is what containers am I going</font>

799
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:34,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to run I build a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> samba container and in</font>

800
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:38,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">that container there was a bunch of</font>

801
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:40,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically fake documents about this fake</font>

802
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,750
corporation that we made up called there

803
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:45,510
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> there was some personnel files in</font>

804
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:48,960
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a fake employee my name</font>

805
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:50,250
marc-edouard<font color="#CCCCCC"> hat so if you translate</font>

806
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,119
that into what might be in you today

807
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:57,329
these call package so in there there's

808
00:35:54,119 --> 00:36:01,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">some details about how far collects to</font>

809
00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:03,809
play some<font color="#E5E5E5"> bugs while he's on company</font>

810
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:07,680
time he had this habit of reusing his

811
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:10,680
username on places like mud and his

812
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,058
password so that was you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

813
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting fact finding information and</font>

814
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:15,059
there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> code in there this is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

815
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:17,010
the files in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> samba container gave</font>

816
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:19,710
you a low point code that<font color="#CCCCCC"> why didn't</font>

817
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:22,829
read the file and there was the next

818
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,790
thing was<font color="#CCCCCC"> SS a prom you can actually ssh</font>

819
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:26,880
into one of the containers

820
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:28,950
Michelle I made two variants of this

821
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,990
thing one of them was on my Derby which

822
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,430
was all actually demonstrated later once

823
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:35,009
you got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> username the password from</font>

824
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:36,240
mr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> acne you could then just log into</font>

825
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,100
this and it was a script you control

826
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,020
that can get your coat<font color="#CCCCCC"> and put it will</font>

827
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,600
let you let you<font color="#E5E5E5"> write</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the display on</font>

828
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:45,840
the Derby which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> functional like I</font>

829
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,390
said I'll demo then on ridges therapy

830
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,620
I've got a little more creative and

831
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:51,900
Keith actually inspired this a little

832
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:56,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">too basically once you connect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

833
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:58,230
ssh daemon in your home directory that

834
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,210
we're still being scripted you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can run</font>

835
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,160
you run it and we give you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really low</font>

836
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:03,960
point code and it would give you a hint

837
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,180
that there was more you could simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

838
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,180
tablet is easy and give you code

839
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:14,120
hopefully that would lead you to look

840
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:14,120
further in the park your van

841
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:20,450
hoping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look a</font>

842
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:22,609
little further if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've dug a little</font>

843
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:24,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">deeper you can find out that the NC</font>

844
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:26,750

you may never<font color="#E5E5E5"> find it in which would if</font>

851
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:43,130
you ran into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pseudo it would let you</font>

852
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:44,509
do pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> what mine when you a</font>

853
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:46,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">higher point code and it would let you</font>

00:37:44,509 --> 00:37:48,980
write<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ridges display I don't think</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody found I think anybody got to</font>

856
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:54,109
that one the next thing I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there</font>

857
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:56,508
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a web server and rich was kind</font>

858
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:58,848
enough to<font color="#CCCCCC"> write a whole bunch of dummy</font>

859
00:37:56,509 --> 00:38:01,549
content about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Derby court and the</font>

860
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:05,180
outside to the beta site and there were

861
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:06,680
references in there as to how<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

862
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,569
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside was like their</font>

863
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,848
corporate headquarters but the beta site

864
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:12,319
was their research and design and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

865
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:14,960
was apparently a few it going on between

866
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:17,000
them but we took<font color="#E5E5E5"> into consideration the</font>

867
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,150
fact that these are air gap networks and

868
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,769
we used that as part of our part of the

869
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:23,960
corporation that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of their security</font>

870
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:30,319
measures they've put their data centers

871
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:32,059
mobile inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> derbies and they because</font>

872
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:34,250
their air gaps there they<font color="#E5E5E5"> never really</font>

873
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,910
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other so they don't communicate</font>

874
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:37,309
with

875
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:38,899
so there's you know jabs from the beta

876
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:42,970
site about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> outer side of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Alpha</font>

877
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,970
site is all you know proper<font color="#E5E5E5"> trim</font>

878
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:55,239
so right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we kind of ran at</font>

879
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:58,150
that a bit and rich kindled some pretty

880
00:38:55,239 --> 00:39:01,599
funny content and the last thing I put

881
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:04,539
on my er be but not riches was a circle

882
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:07,210
month so if you familiar with circle

883
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:09,579
would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said priorities come from</font>

884
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:11,799
the BBS days tech space bugs<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatnot</font>

885
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:14,230
this is a mod that runs on that makes

886
00:39:11,799 --> 00:39:15,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's open source I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see if I put</font>

887
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,319
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the container when I was first</font>

888
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,579
learning attitude docker so I wrote up a

889
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:21,190
dollar container the transfer from one

890
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:22,269
of my fun what the heck if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody finds</font>

891
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,739
this thing it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a fun little</font>

892
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:25,390
bit of nostalgia and if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

893
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:29,039
just play circle but on my dirty good

894
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:32,259
rest of the convention then so be it

895
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:34,089
turns out nobody really did that but I

896
00:39:32,259 --> 00:39:36,069
worked it into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> seat here and that's</font>

897
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:39,910
also part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the demonstration I'm about</font>

898
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:41,558
to get so I think I've covered most of

899
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,999
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> build and most of the software</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

900
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:45,860
rinse that I miss I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

901
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:47,839
pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up no I don't think so</font>

902
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:50,630
so I thought I would give you some

903
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:53,060
screenshots what it would look like to

904
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:55,940
try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the ssh container on</font>

905
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:59,660
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so first of all you</font>

906
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:01,850
would see on your wireless access point

907
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:03,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">called dirty whore mouth again there</font>

908
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:05,319
were two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these there before valid</font>

909
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,950
herbivore beta from<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had one for</font>

910
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:10,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">Richard so they were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

911
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:12,680
segregated<font color="#E5E5E5"> other once you connected</font>

912
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:17,210
you'd see that you get an IP address

913
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:21,470
that's in Colorado 1042 done<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0x address</font>

914
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:23,030
space net mass tells you how big that

915
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:24,439
network is this is where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said there</font>

916
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:27,950
were sixty five thousand addresses

917
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,830
available I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cheat a little</font>

918
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:33,830
bit because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know where the hosts run</font>

919
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:35,690
basically in the low range basically

920
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:37,670
below the<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy people there was some</font>

921
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:42,070
aggressive base have left no posts so

922
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:42,070
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those hosts was running at</font>

923
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:47,750
1040 20 10 so if you were to just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hang</font>

924
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:50,660
back that thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say hey look for 22</font>

925
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:52,280
so it looks like SSH but<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously you</font>

926
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:54,049
can't get into ssh for that user name in

927
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,340
a passionate unless you know something I

928
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:59,240
don't which if you do I want to know

929
00:40:55,340 --> 00:41:00,620
that a lot is<font color="#CCCCCC"> insane so you might keep</font>

930
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking you'll find hey there's another</font>

931
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:06,500
container running on 44 pounds the heck

932
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:08,480
is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4000 so one of the things you</font>

933
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,010
might do to find out what's on for 4,000

934
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:17,630
was just telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to it and when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

935
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:19,460
tell that to it you'll find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mud so and</font>

936
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:22,940
you'll also find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a user</font>

937
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:24,830
they're called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hackney he's a bot that I</font>

938
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:29,300
wrote really simple one he just

939
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:31,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically he basically sits there and if</font>

940
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,290
you ask him<font color="#E5E5E5"> what his password is there's</font>

941
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,240
a one in three chance that they'll just

942
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,860
give me this bastard this is a really

943
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">really simple you know social</font>

944
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:41,750
engineering flag whatever this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font>

945
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:44,710
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> when he doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

946
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:46,790
password he gets paranoid he runs away

947
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:50,420
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you'll come back by the Lich</font>

948
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:52,430
later and if you ask them<font color="#E5E5E5"> again he'll</font>

949
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:55,100
just tell you hey it's puppy 69

950
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:58,069
andoni diem code because you were you

951
00:41:55,100 --> 00:42:01,790
know diligent enough to ask him again

952
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:03,650
and it gives you a hint<font color="#E5E5E5"> siiii the ring</font>

953
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:06,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">bearer and that's because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have this</font>

954
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:09,980
ring on my hand which has an NFC chip in

955
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:11,209
it and i wrote a code in it great so if

956
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,850
you were smart let's figure out because

957
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:15,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">my clear avatar is me only to bring up</font>

958
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:17,870
so if you were smart enough to figure

959
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:19,220
out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have this ring that you can</font>

960
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:20,569
scan from the phone you could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

961
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:24,439
code and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have given you kill</font>

962
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:26,060
more points any also you know then runs

963
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,630
away because he gave you is this

964
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:32,960
password<font color="#E5E5E5"> and code so then you know you</font>

965
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:34,760
can put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that code in however now that</font>

966
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,870
you have a password hey wat let's try

967
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:40,970
that ssh container so yeah cessation and

968
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:43,700
you find that the user name and password

969
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:45,890
did hack mean with the fluffy 69<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got</font>

970
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:48,169
you in association you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> around look</font>

971
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:51,620
there's a script called on me but that's

972
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:53,270
not apply I don't know what is when you

973
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:55,190
want it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that simple i</font>

974
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,450
haven't made an SP trivia question and

975
00:42:55,190 --> 00:43:00,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is based on my rather eclectic</font>

976
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:00,040

980
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:11,980
find the answer so this wasn't that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kmfdm it responds with a</font>

00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:22,810
came at the intent ordering and then it

984
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,060
asks you for a 16 character output did

985
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:27,190
you collect the foot on the display<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

986
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,630
once you get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that look at you code</font>

987
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:30,850
because you were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find this and</font>

988
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:34,270
then blow the whole the next 30 minutes

989
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:37,029
my hat looks like this that was all part

990
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:39,880
of the loop that we wrote for the LED

991
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:41,890
display the display in a number of

992
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">things this was one of them you would</font>

993
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,859
display whenever someone connected to

00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:47,500
the access point it would display their

995
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:49,000
host name for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few seconds even</font>

996
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,500
displayed as advertised blue but

997
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,260
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> told you we're quite a support</font>

00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:59,110
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the exercise aim was for the</font>

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:07,990
just basic information in the party go

1003
00:44:03,069 --> 00:44:10,180
there and so that's really sort of it

1004
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:14,288

1008
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:24,339
at the end so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can find more</font>

1009

00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:02,558
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the scoreboard after every time I</font>

1020
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:04,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ended up with like five or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

1021
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:06,609
people that finally scored any points I

1022
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:08,669
think two or three<font color="#E5E5E5"> different people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1023
00:45:06,609 --> 00:45:08,670
I

1024
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:15,660
so if didn't quite get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exposures</font>

1025
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:17,550
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoped it was one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the problems</font>

1026
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,859
was in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to get into the</font>

1027
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:22,910
thing you had to be where I was so you

1028
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:25,020
know that wireless range we did problem

1029
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:26,640
when I go to their begun I'd like to

1030
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,680
actually go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pause</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'll just sit</font>

1031
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,400
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> lobby so you have to try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

me basically someone has to trail you

1033
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:39,060
and I can't be suspect about alike

1034

00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">my early on concerns was I'm going to</font>

1036
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,420
have a crowd of people following me

1037
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,450
around with mobile devices no laptops or

1038
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:50,100
whatever that<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't happen but maybe</font>

1039
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:51,810
what if it was more popularity I don't

1040
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,850
know there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> certainly in a lot of</font>

1041
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:57,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">visibility a lot of we had a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter</font>

1042
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:59,310
account for the project and we were

1043
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,750
tweeting a lot I had automatically set

1044
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:03,060
up to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell people where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we might</font>

1045
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:04,830
be you know I kept saying like over in

1046
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,650
this talk you know I'm in this talk

1047
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:09,450
originally other one you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

1048
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:11,970
so we did our best dragon visibility out

1049
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:14,460
they're gonna just in a few people were

1050
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:17,069
really interested and they were the ones

1051
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:18,990
that I tried to give them the ability to

1052
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:21,349
dragon<font color="#CCCCCC"> make slices hang around town</font>

1053
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:23,459
spread 11

1054
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:25,140
otherwise it just you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't have</font>

1055
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:30,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">people coming on coming soon Thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> You</font>

1057
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:36,690
have it's a comment further on that what

1058
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,460
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found is while there weren't a</font>

1059
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:41,010
whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people saying oh we yelled</font>

1060
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:44,339

00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,650
said hey what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that thing on your head</font>

1064
00:46:47,279 --> 00:46:51,839
and then you know it got us the ability

1065
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:58,910
to chat with people to be made out of

1066
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:58,910
otherwise life is<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

1067
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:11,919
yeah anything else you have source code

1068
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:13,570
or anything for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the store border and the</font>

1069
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,090
score<font color="#E5E5E5"> edit released the source</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where I</font>

1070
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:19,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably good it's not there's nothing</font>

1071
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:22,240
private in there let's play<font color="#E5E5E5"> loop the ND</font>

1072
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:24,759
library bar<font color="#CCCCCC"> bull on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that blog into that</font>

1073
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:30,729
I like so they're they're actually at

1074
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:32,860
Lisa below the only the library there's

1075
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:35,560
some some things that are still in there

1076
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:36,850
that are specific to this that I really

1077
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,220
want to clean out before it was

1078
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:41,529
officially like released to the public

1079
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:43,299
and Carol but yeah you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1080
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:48,130
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> that blog entry there's links to</font>

1081
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:51,820
the beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> of public</font>

1082
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:54,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so just be clear that whole thing</font>

1083
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:56,530
runs off at 160 no or battery<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

1084
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:59,680
on and that's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 hours he said it's</font>

1085
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:03,040
like what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> interpret has this cool</font>

1086
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,290
little USB a meter you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug in in</font>

1087
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,450
line right and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found out that the</font>

1088
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:11,980
Raspberry Pi with nothing else connected

1089
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:13,419
to it drew like 15<font color="#E5E5E5"> min laters and then</font>

1090
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,700
after the display is connected it went

1091
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,700
on and came out closer to like 30 or 40

1092
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:20,529
so the power draw was a lot longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

1093
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">we thought it was going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be so we</font>

1094
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:25,360
could have computed the smaller battery

1095
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:28,290
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yeah that cheap twenty thousand</font>

1096
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,290
billion our batteries in here

1097
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,440
to result in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your range issue might you</font>

1098
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:42,348
consider in the future attic

1099
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,900
cell service<font color="#E5E5E5"> is spotty but as an</font>

1100
00:48:42,349 --> 00:48:47,380
alternative

1101
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:51,130
so maybe that sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there could be</font>

1102
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:52,299
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of other issues if it's on 3g then</font>

1103
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:55,029
wouldn't that mean it would happen to

1104
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:56,920
connect to collect myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> arriving and</font>

1105
00:48:55,029 --> 00:48:59,170
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a cell provider now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1106
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,270
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> publish the IP address now you</font>

1107
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,500
need to pour it on his own right but now

1108
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:04,538
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to not only break into it on</font>

1109
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:08,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">this protected private address space but</font>

1110
00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:10,480
through a cell provider<font color="#E5E5E5"> theorem yeah</font>

1111
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:11,859
that seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'd be tricky plus if I</font>

1112
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,809
wouldn't know what the cell providers

1113
00:49:11,859 --> 00:49:17,049
would have in line to stop that sort of

1114
00:49:13,809 --> 00:49:19,750
thing really I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> never I've never tried</font>

1115
00:49:17,049 --> 00:49:22,509
those little problems with the cars

1116
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:26,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">jeeps oh yeah it's just it not sprint</font>

1117
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:28,950
network right protection well if it's on

1118
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,950
Springs networking won't happen

1119
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:37,650
so yeah we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about I've been</font>

1120
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:39,150
kicking<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the idea of can we work</font>

1121
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:41,880
wireless and leaders into this<font color="#CCCCCC"> next year</font>

1122
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:43,200
somehow you know would it be like things

1123
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> offering the conference but</font>

1124
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,710
then people might steal them how do we

1125
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the power to all conference do we</font>

1126
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:51,030
have to like every day we made the

1127
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:52,799
rounds and plug the batteries<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

1128
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:55,470
other thought was make twice as many

1129
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:58,050
hats and have you know our friends wear

1130
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:59,520
hats that are just repeaters and make

1131
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:01,230
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are around us or just</font>

1132
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,180
build little repeaters into a little

1133
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:05,310
self-contained thing you can carry<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1134
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:06,629
around in your purse or something so

1135
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:13,710
that that might be an option for next

1136
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:15,150
year the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't want to</font>

1137
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:18,000
think you don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to interfere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1138

1139
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,470

1140
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:24,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">track thing for people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's part</font>

1141
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:24,680
of that

1142
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:32,990
some people don't don't want to sit in

1143
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:34,700
TF room all day life so this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1144
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:35,810
something that was part of it I wanted
