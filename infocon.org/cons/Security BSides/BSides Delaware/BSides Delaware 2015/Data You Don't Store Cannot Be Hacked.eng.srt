28
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,979
what else brother other issues with

31
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:51,439
identifying what is first because if you

just say well I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this data is</font>

wraps and you haven't invited it's

35
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,830
pretty hard to say point to and say well

36
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,470
this is important we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move this</font>

00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:06,690
or security zone

00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,690
okay fair enough what else

39
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,400
rather the issues with getting Social

45
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,540
your problem right budget right how many

46
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:30,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh maybe we're do a monthly security</font>

48
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:38,390
nobody have you ever seen one now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

49
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:40,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">stop and talks about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 explain to you</font>

monthly security report is a report that

52
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,280
you create to give executives incidence

53
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,440
of what's happening in your environment

54
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,540
because that that report is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

55
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,990
your foundation for every argument you

56
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:59,260
make regarding budget so what which what

57
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:05,300
do you think that report when it said

58
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:09,049
they guess about spam how many phishing

59
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:11,710
emails would block<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one I gave the</font>

60
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,810
first example what do you think

61
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:17,470
guys don't participate I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

62
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">singing my son</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I think you'll be</font>

63
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,730
better off how BIG's your organization

64
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,980
have any spam messages your block

65
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,470
anymore that that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> my I'm doing the</font>

66
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,959
first suggestion I think one to report

67
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:32,020
we should put how many phishing emails

68
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">per block</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that some type of</font>

vulnerability assessment vulnerability

70
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,820
assessment if we have IPS at the

71
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:42,370
perimeter what can we you can we use

72
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:47,100
that to say we had estimating porn scans

73
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:52,240
or this be the intrusion attempts right

74
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:55,290
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what else in 10 min but</font>

75
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,290
they were successful

76
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:07,268
if it was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a monthly report yeah</font>

77
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,079
everyone might be in trouble at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

78
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:14,890
point um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we can say if they were</font>

79
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:20,109
successful with spam<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> barracuda has a</font>

80
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:22,960
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting feature where</font>

81
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:27,010
they actually tell you spam messages

82
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,020
that it did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not block now if you can</font>

83
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:34,630
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me as fam message that you didn't</font>

84
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:38,310
block why don't you pop hey how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

85
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:41,169
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it but this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what they do so</font>

86
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:44,229
that would be an incidence where you can

87
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:47,440
say okay we got to thousands bama tins

88
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:49,300
this month we had 50 go through now if

89
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,460
I'm an executive I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why the</font>

90
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:58,990
50 went through you gotta be prepared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

91
00:04:51,460 --> 00:05:00,789
answer that type of question ah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> cubic</font>

92
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">even the security for born what else you</font>

vulnerability assessment I'm saying what

95
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,550
else what else would scare they have a

96
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:12,729
lot of an executive violence<font color="#CCCCCC"> has found</font>

98
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:19,750

100
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:26,110
that you're summing doing a summary and

101
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:29,139
if somebody lost a laptop<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let's</font>

102
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:32,050
let's say for example healthcare company

103
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:34,330
been Reich's we've seen that right lost

104
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,099
stolen laptops that had medical records

105
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,169
that would be a good day to put her own

106
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:40,810
report how about how much that cost the

107
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:43,840
company right whatever that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would report</font>

108
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:46,000
to because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i lost laptop we</font>

109
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,878
had to inform a hundred thousand people

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this issue there's going to be costs</font>

111
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">associated with that and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happens</font>

112
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:54,639
more than once in a year that's it

113
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:56,438
that's a real problem what else do you

114
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:02,199
baby put on the report help those

115
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:05,860
tickets related to security yeah give it

116
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:08,680
let us<font color="#CCCCCC"> cecilio the password reset but</font>

117
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:11,169
you can see hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know by the way so</font>

118
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,090
these little tacit you're saying it

119
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:15,698
right that big video<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how that</font>

120
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">relates them to security or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

121
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:20,620
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lead to potential problem but</font>

122
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,509
hey well this person keeps getting now

128
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:35,080
things like that so generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

129
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,789
security report is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

130
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,500
presentation but it's a foundation for

131
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:41,009
every argument to make regarding

132
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:45,099
security no matter whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> its buying</font>

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,789
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> an executive and you're saying</font>

136
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:53,198
I need fifty thousand dollars for this I

137
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:55,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">needed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred thousand dollars for</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all you providing is your word</font>

139
00:06:55,659 --> 00:07:00,099
maybe if you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sands and get some</font>

140
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,990
information maybe they've had some

141
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:04,569
security awareness training your

142
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,250
building on that nothing nothing helps

143
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:08,979
by the security report so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

144
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:11,979
do one I'll strongly recommend that you

145
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:13,839

at the end feel free to reach out we can

147
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,190
work on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> together I have a template</font>

148
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:21,008
i'll continue but it's a really great

149
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help increase oh now just a</font>

150
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:23,510
where

151
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,910
the attacks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened but the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> team</font>

152
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,980
increased budget as well which helps all

153
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,140
of what we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all right so</font>

154
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,870
jumping into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerPoint while ago</font>

155
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:37,130
today data you cannot data that you

156
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:39,380
don't store cannot be that first we want

157
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk first we want to explain what it</font>

158
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,880
is that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about what data</font>

159
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:47,270
are we talking about we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

160
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,219
data that hackers one the way i classify

161
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,320
this is my classification it doesn't

162
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,570
necessarily align with the way the

163
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:58,190
industry doesn't so I want to set that

164
00:07:53,570 --> 00:08:00,469
up from sorry p i ah everybody knows

165
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:03,020
that is first of all identifiable

166
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:05,150
information sensitive information it's a

167
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,490
general term different in every

168
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:12,140
environment you going and I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

169
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:17,630
explain how I define the two i define

170
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:21,770
PII by the law and the reason I / the

171
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:24,230
law is because if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a piii reach</font>

172
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:29,090
then it requires a data breach

173
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:31,490
disclosure by<font color="#CCCCCC"> block so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep I keep those</font>

174
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,319
terms together because we know exactly

175
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,360
what we're talking about we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

176
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,820
about credit honoring we're talking

177
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,990
about the whole shebang of data breach

178
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:46,700
aftermath ok so give me by I guess why

179
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:48,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">driver's license number isn't rape that</font>

180
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,180
varies from state to state

181
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:55,830
reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> walls are the threshold as well as</font>

182
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:57,599
your announcement it's a good answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

183
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,100
does vary from state to state but that's

184
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,640
not why anybody else guess while

185
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,110
driver's license numbers in red come on

186
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:11,640
I'm getting a song<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready i'm going to</font>

187
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:15,470
start singing no<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because it is the</font>

188
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:19,080
one that most people don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is on</font>

189
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:22,440
list as far as those waters concern to

190
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:25,110
come so I security who doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> put mine</font>

191
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,590
up but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ask a financial aid person</font>

192
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:31,350
or someone who deals with via our

193
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:34,350
regular basis if a driver's license

194
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,690
number equals a<font color="#E5E5E5"> social</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

195
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,990
in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data breach they don't know</font>

196
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,610
so that's why I'm ready and we walk away

197
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,790
today and you're going back to your

198
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,440
security duties keep in mind people do

199
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">not know driver's license numbers on</font>

200
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,330
that list<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a breach of Jess</font>

201
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,339
names and driver's license numbers that

202
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data breach it requires disclosure</font>

203
00:09:53,340 --> 00:10:00,330
and you might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some either</font>

204
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:03,810
need protection from any before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

205
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:05,730
a question please stop us and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

206
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,189
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it everything else here</font>

207
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:12,690
standard SI same credit card number bank

208
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:16,160
ghana so now sensitive information this

209
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,160
is where we have not fun

210
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,900
that

211
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,630
so as I said I structure my sensitive

212
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:37,250
information and a base moment of the way

213
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:40,320
I like it to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> PRI goes with the law</font>

214
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:42,720
period that's the way i do now sensitive

215
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,060
information is very different and it's a

216
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,220
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> more complicated first one is</font>

217
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,888
self-explanatory intellectual property

218
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,389
we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that infrastructure invite</font>

219
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:55,769
something why infrastructures on this

220
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:57,690
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to give it more list of</font>

221
00:10:55,769 --> 00:11:00,149
your assets right addresses or something

222
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,190
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey if I have a map them this is</font>

223
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:07,680
important this is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can connect to</font>

224
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:10,170
it art architecture any kind of notes

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,569
regarding<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense of regarding the</font>

227
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:18,029
what's in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DMZ you know which</font>

228
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,480
application server does what which

229
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:24,180
resources have PR all that's a part of

230
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,750
infrastructure information but it's not

231
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:31,380
p I hi however we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> protect it</font>

232
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:34,829
like PII so we put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the SI list</font>

233
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:38,610
sensitive information list HIPAA is not

234
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:41,339
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> VII this however because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the HIPAA</font>

235
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:44,579
law we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to protect it it's on the</font>

236
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:48,110
silence wires then why do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

237
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,109
fingers up here

238
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:56,799
that could be a vector of attack how

239
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:59,319
could it<font color="#CCCCCC"> be if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone is able to</font>

240
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:03,639
compromise the vendor potentially have

241
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:06,759
access to your this is that home depot

242
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:10,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> black right that's the word on the</font>

243
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,259
street<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you have the jury still out</font>

244
00:12:10,469 --> 00:12:17,769
so let's use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pro let's use an example</font>

245
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:20,169
or city with top party George the

246
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:22,989
bottoms up we're seeing in women's

247
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:26,409
university right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's say mosey</font>

248
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:29,319
university uses company a forward their

249
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:32,769
data center<font color="#CCCCCC"> air-conditioned right well</font>

250
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:35,498
if I know that now I know who's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

251
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:37,779
the data center right can't fix it if

252
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:39,819
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't go in so if i wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

253
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,859
something hostile well then I might go

254
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:43,748
get a job at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> company or I might</font>

255
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:45,879
just have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sides here to take</font>

256
00:12:43,749 --> 00:12:48,009
a uniform and go to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them the</font>

257
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:52,179
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> day whatever the case is however</font>

258
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:54,189
now I know a third-party way to get

259
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:56,858
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that organization their</font>

261
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:02,549
a tool for hackers just as going

262
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:07,689
directly to the organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah okay contacts contacts is pretty</font>

264
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:12,549
much the same as vendors the people you

265
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:15,459
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are one of the great people</font>

around you and and use them as a tool to

274
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:39,880
get what I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> usernames passwords</font>

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:47,320
they're all right great dataverse

277
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:54,550
question of the day why our data burst

278
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:59,460
here but not on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pii list because the</font>

279
00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:02,199
law does not happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the pilots now</font>

280
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:05,740
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we're talking about Delaware</font>

281
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,690
Pennsylvania and Maryland there may be a

282
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:11,620
few states that you have but the

283
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:14,470
surrounding states do not have t.i i do

284
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:20,800
not have sorry date of birth on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pii</font>

285
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:26,230
just that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gave birth is up if</font>

it constitute a data breach disclosure

288
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:39,060
revised like another what if names and

289
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">David versa preach does it cost to a</font>

290
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:51,479
data breach disclosure it's a trick

291
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:54,480
question yes why yes because so before

292
00:14:51,480 --> 00:15:01,580
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say yes or no what do you have</font>

293
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,580
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask yourself what state are you in</font>

294
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we talked about preventing data</font>

295
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,310
breaches preventing data breach

296
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,650
disclosures and all the calls that come

297
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:13,859
with it the first question<font color="#CCCCCC"> how bad</font>

298
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:17,000
yourself is what state are you in what

299
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,820
laws are you governed by because the law

300
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:26,370
governs data breach disclosures

301
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:27,960
everybody understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we are</font>

302
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:30,570
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some of the industries</font>

303
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:34,350
that you're in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> friend in the</font>

304
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:37,620
backstage utility okay I<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine utility</font>

305
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:40,290
might have some unix servers yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

306
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:44,040
too old for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe in a</font>

307
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:45,630
frame or 10 and so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have</font>

308
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,219
applications that are we're going to

309
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:51,110
have databases when I have everything

310
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:54,990
that's listed up in so how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we today</font>

311
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:57,990
plan over the next five to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years one</font>

312
00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:01,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely removing PII from the</font>

environment using a utility company

314
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:06,120
let's say a water company you give them

318
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:19,800
have two story argh you know who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

321
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,020
dang

322
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:28,479
curity report should walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and say you</font>

323
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:31,180
know what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plan to get</font>

324
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,580
rid of this now picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as a</font>

325
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:36,160
security broke walking you ask for

326
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:38,200
funding to protect the perimeter to

327
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,089
protect the data but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens when</font>

328
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,850
you team up with the infrastructure guys

329
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:45,520
and you walk in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you say hey let's go</font>

330
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:49,150
in together but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you plan I want you</font>

331
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,650
to plan this way now you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going in and</font>

332
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,810
you're going in with the infrastructure

333
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:55,720
budget which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> always bigger right oh</font>

334
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:58,180
it's bigger and it's just a change to

335
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,300
what they're doing it's not additional

336
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:03,279
funding for security you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what said</font>

337
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,448
so now we're talking about security

338
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,939
budget we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

339
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:12,280
infrastructure budget to do things a

340
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:15,209
different way notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> your question if</font>

341
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:18,819
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no social security numbers</font>

342
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:22,329
what is your wrist your risk of being

343
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:24,459
breached for identity theft what is your

344
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:28,030
risk for having a data breach that

345
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:31,500
results in identity down if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

346
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,500
social security<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers a union bar</font>

347
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:41,059
so you go and talk to executive you say

348
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:43,490
hey we have three million<font color="#E5E5E5"> Social</font>

349
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:46,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">Security numbers here that equals thats</font>

350
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:49,130
a $25 personal security number 75

351
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:51,770
million dollars then we can check out if

352
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:54,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">their priests every five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years we can</font>

353
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:57,770
have infrastructure with zero so scared

354
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:00,620
numbers and that equals<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero million</font>

355
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:03,710
dollars are we not speaking executive

356
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:06,709
language<font color="#CCCCCC"> now right did you not just make</font>

357
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,750
a new best friend you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're</font>

358
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:11,210
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the infrastructure guys with you</font>

359
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:14,090
because you're not talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

360
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:17,600
you're talking infrastructure but it has

361
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:20,899
the effect of reducing the risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to zero</font>

362
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,649
now that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a you know that's an example</font>

363
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,450
that will take a lot of work but some

364
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:29,030
some companies some<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations some</font>

365
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,070
industries they have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to make</font>

366
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:33,860
these changes to remove<font color="#E5E5E5"> this data from</font>

367
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:36,290
the environment completely they just

368
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,959
need someone to start the conversation

369
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,820
so why while you're doing perimeter

370
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,710
defense database security service

371
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,659
security you also kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you know</font>

372
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:47,120
what yes we want to secure the

373
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,740
infrastructure but why don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get rid</font>

374
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,199
of this data that's going to cost us a

375
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,890
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money that's that's what I want</font>

376
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,890
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about</font>

377
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:19,090
this is Michael jr. occasion though he's

378
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:22,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 8 year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> old twin so hey there process</font>

379
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:27,070
Apple pay leads the way is anybody know

380
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:31,129
I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay leads the way right glute</font>

381
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:34,040
you re invite know why we say Apple bay

382
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:36,530
leaves the way and not google peg not

383
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,620
chase<font color="#CCCCCC"> pic not any of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

384
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:43,129
electronic payments aiming system us

385
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:45,590
maybe maybe they get your Apple ID set

386
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:50,270
up your name they give you a tradition

387
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:54,100
check today's like a generator<font color="#CCCCCC"> atom</font>

388
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:56,510
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> every single transaction yes</font>

389
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,340
virtual numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> to transactions instead</font>

390
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:01,309
of the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> card numbers we did that's</font>

391
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:04,490
that's a part of it so break it down for

392
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:09,370
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> iphone 6 plus when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i added the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> car</font>

393
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:13,820
to him my card went to one place a chip

394
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:16,610
hardwired to this phone it does not go

395
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:19,159
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that go to apple service as the first</font>

396
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:23,479
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> point it does not go to apple</font>

397
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:26,120
service every second the chip like

398
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,600
everything else in<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple's iphone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

399
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:34,189
segregated it cannot<font color="#CCCCCC"> be hacked across</font>

400
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:39,350
the network so in order to do a mass hat

401
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:43,720
you'd have to have 50,000 volts now

402
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:47,629
Apple is upfront about this<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

403
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:49,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google is not and if you know who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by I</font>

404
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:52,070
know Google there's a server somewhere

405
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:54,230
sitting with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> garden and you'll</font>

406
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:56,780
figure it out when they said oh google

407
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,910
pay was preached a hundred thousand card

408
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:02,809
numbers compromise and then you'll know

409
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:11,570
they're storing the car<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm sure if</font>

410
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:13,428
that's what's going to happen so if you

411
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:16,610
are processing<font color="#E5E5E5"> cars in your environment</font>

412
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:19,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay please do not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> store the card</font>

413
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:22,100
numbers if you need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> record of</font>

414
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:24,320
transaction store the last board if they

415
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:27,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't give the record by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last four</font>

416
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,168
then the record doesn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> got but</font>

417
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:33,740
we're talking about fifteen dollars per

418
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:36,230
card number if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a hundred</font>

419
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand transactions a hundred thousand</font>

420
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:43,130
different cars that's 1.5 billion

421
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:46,100
dollars for what what what benefited

422
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:48,260
that provide you know so we really have

423
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,969
to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at removing this</font>

424
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,309
information from them from the

425
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:55,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">environment and if we're not storing it</font>

426
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:58,100
it's not going to be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trenton right</font>

427
00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:00,320
somebody brought up target earlier help

428
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:05,300
me understand how hit numbers got

429
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:10,040
reached<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry I've lost how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

430
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:12,080
reach pinups they're only in transit so

431
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,450
what you're telling me is that not only

432
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:19,960
did you compromise<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server but you</font>

433
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:22,460
were actively recording network traffic

434
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:27,530
it doesn't get more ridiculous<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that</font>

435
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:29,390
the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> line it just doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

436
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,879
if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> store it it can't be in</font>

437
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:35,360
transit so there's no server to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hack</font>

438
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:38,900
there's no hard data to sniff on the

439
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,990
line again data breach avoided let's

440
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:44,120
look at the exam<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do some of you</font>

441
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:45,350
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a bookstore here well</font>

442
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,510
let's say for the sake of this

443
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:50,360
conversation the bookstore only accepts

444
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:57,470
out of it what is the risk of data

445
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:59,659
breach for the bookstore 00<font color="#E5E5E5"> million</font>

446
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,000
dollars and I like to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> a million</font>

447
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:04,880
because if there was a risk it be a

448
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,820
million collars attached to it so 0

449
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">million dollars is the risk if they only</font>

450
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:14,059
use Apple pay because the systems in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

451
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:17,030
bookstore never receive the credit card

452
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:19,428
numbers that's the frame of mind that we

453
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:24,470
have to get executives thinking how do

454
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:28,640
we get rid of this paper lastly EMP does

455
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:32,809
anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> know why he is a joke it is the</font>

456
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:37,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">punch line and everywhere else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we put</font>

457
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:40,520
a chip in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> coffin and we say if you go</font>

458
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,210
to a terminal it's going to check<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

459
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:49,700
make sure the dead ship is in the car

460
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:54,200
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave my shop online is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> boom I did</font>

461
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:56,990
I shop online yesterday ah what's the

462
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:01,550
watching my ass did they check my chip

463
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:05,750
right how so what does EMV have to do

464
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:10,040
phone on<font color="#CCCCCC"> chopped nothing so how did you</font>

465
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:11,750
fix the problem oh we did sorry we just

466
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:20,450
mandated something that didn't fix

467
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:24,110
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ogre so EMV yes it works</font>

468
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:27,830
it keeps people from taking TV banks

469
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:30,370
nice up debit<font color="#E5E5E5"> card printer and printing</font>

470
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:33,309
cards at home and going to

471
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:38,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">door and swiping the wet it did not</font>

472
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:44,050
however touch online banking fraud how

473
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:46,690
we have a government mandate that forces

474
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:50,320
people to apply that doesn't fix a

475
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:52,809
single damn problem I don't know it's

476
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:58,360
frustrating I'm immediate bringing his

477
00:24:52,809 --> 00:25:04,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">nut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it's all about that you are</font>

478
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:07,090
targeting most know the law do your

479
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:08,800
research<font color="#E5E5E5"> two things I want you to do</font>

480
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,559
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk into that executives</font>

481
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,240
office I want you to have a data breach

482
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:19,660
report that they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been getting monthly</font>

483
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:21,760
I want you to have the law because that

484
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:27,970
is where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> money comes from it comes</font>

485
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:31,690
from what data requires the increased

486
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:36,670
exposure if you align your<font color="#E5E5E5"> P I hat the</font>

487
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:38,260
way i do then in any piii stolen know

488
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:43,390
that that's a date of reached is hope

489
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:45,910
that disclosure does<font color="#CCCCCC"> Solon encrypted</font>

490
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:48,780
data count as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> day to route anybody</font>

491
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,780
answer that question

492
00:25:50,030 --> 00:26:00,750
was it maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even keel no she said a</font>

493
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:05,820
good team not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just in rid of me oh sure</font>

494
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:10,400
so that goes back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the law some states</font>

495
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:14,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say say if it's readable data</font>

496
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:19,050
some say say if the data is encrypted it

497
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:21,840
does not constitute as a data<font color="#E5E5E5"> it depends</font>

498
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:25,678
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state law that your organization</font>

499
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,809
is governed by but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has to go with I</font>

500
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,870
don't want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into encryption in</font>

501
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:33,330
this talk but encryption is your next

502
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:36,389
best friend so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> an environment</font>

503
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:38,879
where you have limited<font color="#E5E5E5"> the amount of PII</font>

504
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:41,940
in the environment but you cannot remove

505
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:45,990
it a hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent the very next step</font>

506
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:48,090
is encryption right so you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

507
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:50,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in there with you the law says if</font>

508
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:54,240
we encrypt the data then it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a data</font>

509
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:57,000
breach well if you're all your PR is

510
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:05,490
encrypted and the keys are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not on the</font>

511
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:08,700
same server as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> VII I want to</font>

512
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:11,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's here any minute if your data is</font>

513
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:15,030
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> P is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypted please don't store</font>

514
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:17,790
the keys on the same server on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

515
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:20,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">southern on the same infrastructure put</font>

516
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:24,178
them somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> else please ah there are</font>

517
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:26,940
some state laws that's it if the keys

518
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:29,490
were compromised it is a day so<font color="#E5E5E5"> when a</font>

519
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:32,250
serious I'd you want to make sure keys

520
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:37,380
are somewhere safe<font color="#E5E5E5"> away and not copied</font>

521
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:39,870
all over their instruction so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

522
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:43,530
the risk right on back to the risk

523
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:46,709
question what is the risk if well new

524
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:49,470
social security<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers are stolen they</font>

525
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:50,290
are encrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> the keys aren't we're not</font>

526
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:55,030
even still

527
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:59,889
new construction what's the risk nothing

528
00:27:55,030 --> 00:28:03,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">right my favorite time 0 million dollars</font>

529
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:05,230
that's the risk so when you talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

530
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:08,230
executives you're speaking executive

531
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:11,050
speak throw that billion dollars on them

532
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:13,990
this will cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 billion dollars</font>

533
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:16,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">beatable social security numbers when</font>

534
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:20,020
criminals career numbers cost zero

535
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:23,170
billion dollars ever as<font color="#E5E5E5"> long as the keys</font>

536
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:26,680
remain away if there's no there's no

537
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:29,650
risk so tell me whatever executives

538
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:33,490
excuse can be what do you think their

539
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:35,830
excuse can be to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that art got all right</font>

540
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:37,420
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a thing all you got a fun one</font>

541
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:41,460
because when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're talking those</font>

542
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,460
millions of dollars what can they say

543
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:49,240
when does the data breach have to be

544
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:53,650
reporting very very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> various</font>

545
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:57,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">bass state also a part of your plan if</font>

546
00:28:53,650 --> 00:29:01,300
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> PR is stolen you have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know how</font>

547
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:04,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">long you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> report that why is that</font>

548
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:07,240
important well if your PR is not

549
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:09,429
encrypted because you didn't talk to

550
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,660
your executive yet because everybody's

551
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:14,320
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to their executive when</font>

552
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:17,380
they leave right yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if that</font>

553
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:22,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens you have to know how long you</font>

554
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:24,940
had well if<font color="#E5E5E5"> your detection time isn't</font>

555
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:27,220
fast enough well then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a whole</font>

556
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:29,560
other issue if it has to be reported

557
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:32,020
within 30 days and you're only looking

558
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,760
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain things every 30 days you have</font>

559
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,980
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem in your process that's going</font>

560
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,930
to cost your organization a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

561
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,570
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you want to look at that stuff</font>

562
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:45,520
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're at your process online</font>

563
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:49,510
with the law what happens if a vendor is

564
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:51,340
breached for your customer data any

565
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:54,980
cloud fans in the room

566
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:58,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">Salesforce take it over the world what</font>

567
00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:01,910
happens if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer that no</font>

568
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:04,340
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to sing a song a song right</font>

569
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:12,500
plus I've got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dad's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen is</font>

570
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:14,260
both here no agency thank ya there would

571
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:18,410
be a lot of money taken from photograph

572
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:22,460

718
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:59,610
yeah exactly infrastructure wanted to

719
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:03,330
bring it all new stuff and no security

720
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:04,680

00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:42,060
executive support will bring the funding

737
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,430
necessary having that infrastructure

738
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:47,250
support will bring the funding and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

741
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,940
what I'm doing too so we want to make

742
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:55,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">friends we want to get that support so</font>

743
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,380
that we can steer our<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations in a</font>

744
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:01,650
different direction no breaches will

745
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:06,140
always occur you know it is anyone

749
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:20,910
it is that's right there are more more

00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:23,640
companies coming up that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will not</font>

751

see on CNBC they are not publicly traded

752
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:30,569
companies you're not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about</font>

753
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:34,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">like cyber Ark who get paid lots of</font>

754
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:37,770
money to 50 dates so much that now they

755
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:41,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">package them in a nice package that is</font>

an IPS or load balancer all the way to

759
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,629
the data center they'll create a nice

760
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:53,810
little package with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bow and sell it</font>

NSA was the only buyer of this

information<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty things bonded now</font>

764
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:05,240
everybody what do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> your kid as</font>

765
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,060
soon as Edward Snowden started leaking

766
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,799
stuff because you said there and said

767
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,150
hey we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put up more defense</font>

768
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,640
because they're trying to take our stuff

769
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:17,390
Oh knew they'd win bought them some zero

770
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:19,430
days and they went to war you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have each</font>

771
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:21,950
other cyber war started whenever Snowden

772
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:24,950
started sharing everything he shared I

773
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:27,439
don't I don't agree or disagree that I

774
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:31,189
stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of that but once you once these</font>

775
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,589
countries found out that the level the

776
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:36,079
United States<font color="#CCCCCC"> has taken it to you best</font>

777
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:38,900
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they stepped it up and this</font>

778
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:41,800
is how they<font color="#CCCCCC"> do there is no other way to</font>

781
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:52,400
infrastructure is more important than

00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:53,630
securing all right and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have about 10</font>

784
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at some real life examples I share</font>

785
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,339
a lot information with you about

know there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always different industries</font>

788
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:06,078
and different infrastructure in the room

789
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:08,569
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody wanted to share some</font>

790
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,030
information or tell me why this would be

791
00:40:08,569 --> 00:40:13,690
a problem for them we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can engage about</font>

00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:24,530
you do place bugs to work it up examples

00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:39,640
lot of stock trades at choice of the

00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:44,560
secret sauce as now because they're not

801
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:46,930
actually doing retail its institutional

802
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,410
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have the iif</font>

however<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're doing retirement plan</font>

805
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:57,820
something like that so there is a tax ID

806
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:59,590
associated with it which if you're doing

807

<font color="#E5E5E5">that type of level you're not talking</font>

810
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:11,109
dollars at a time then if I got into

this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> drain this lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of money other</font>

812
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:15,210
things so in their case

813
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:23,010
there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> record</font>

819
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:42,839
whatever but they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to have some</font>

820
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:44,910
pretty detailed information so it's not

821
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:47,490
often talked about immediate<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

822
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:51,118
business identity theft it's far worse

823
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:53,520
thinking soon honey no<font color="#CCCCCC"> no far worse it</font>

824
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,920
doesn't get any media attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but</font>

825
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,230
just with the tax ID at home nothing

826
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,299
else not only can you still an

827
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:02,700
organization's identity you can open an

828
00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:04,380
office a bank account credit card

829
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,549
processing you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> even start getting</font>

830
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,430
some of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers and they're in a</font>

831
00:42:05,549 --> 00:42:11,190
diplomat of the world just from the tax

832
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:14,759
ID number business verification is a

833
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:17,369
tragedy right so that in itself is a

834
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:20,520
good reason to move away a TI tambien

835
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:22,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">emari right they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need the EIN</font>

836
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,690
numbers to track the transactions they

837
00:42:22,589 --> 00:42:27,540
need them when the customer first comes

838
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:29,640
in so until authenticate that customer

839
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:32,279
right business credit check and then

840
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:34,170
because of that they then use the EIN

841
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:37,020
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> two the lifetime of the customer</font>

842
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:40,339
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it necessary no it's not so in</font>

843
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:44,970
that scenario<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm looking at a way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

844
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:47,520
simple customer ID that when a company

845
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:49,740
comes in and they bring the Taj Amidala

846
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,930
retirement plan you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept the</font>

847
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:54,000
eye and first we have to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that credit</font>

848
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:57,440
check but after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they get a customer</font>

849
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,540
ID the customer ID follows their money

850
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:04,319
for the lights on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer the ein</font>

851
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:06,540
after that credit check get scoop and

852
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,759
Malcolm out that's that's what I'm

853
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:10,099
aiming for that's where you start the

854
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,170
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

855
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:14,690
infrastructure people and then you kind

856
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:17,930
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work through its not going perfection</font>

857
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:20,150
and if I say no it can't go away okay

858
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:24,348
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we limit it down to one server</font>

859
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:26,150
or two sir can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we determine where it's</font>

860
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:28,069
going to be in Trinity you know all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

861
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:30,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's when all the nitty-gritty part of</font>

862
00:43:28,069 --> 00:43:31,788
the details comes out but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to</font>

863
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:34,009
start the conversation with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

864
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:36,769
infrastructure folks first that's why I

865
00:43:34,009 --> 00:43:38,660
use Apple pay as an example because the

866
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:41,359
credit card number never<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaves it's a</font>

867
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:43,848
virtual number you know and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

868
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:46,069
virtual number is compromised it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

869
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:47,299
data breach disclosure and it really

870
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:49,960
doesn't mean anything because it can do

871
00:43:47,299 --> 00:43:55,930
anything with that is that makes sense

872
00:43:49,960 --> 00:44:02,720
any other examples 10 minutes left

873
00:43:55,930 --> 00:44:05,868
sounds full song i will call somebody

874
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:08,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">goes over like this before especially</font>

875
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:11,660
there's a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies out there that</font>

876
00:44:08,269 --> 00:44:14,299
kind of collect information about you

877
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:19,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">beaumont your mother's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maiden name all</font>

878
00:44:14,299 --> 00:44:24,640
differently good they act as a surrogate

879
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:24,640
or the verification

880
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:32,899
has anyone looked into that model where

881
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:35,810
you have a trusted party that turned out

882
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:38,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be the government you mean I like a</font>

883
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:40,520
lot kind of like reproducing the credit

884
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:43,010
check process but without the without

885
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,810
the p I it would be so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it</font>

886
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:46,820
and nobody else needs to have a date

887
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:49,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">they would have a key or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font>

888
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:51,980
allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> their trusted together to that</font>

889
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:54,020
ball so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

890
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:57,440
have publicly traded companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

891
00:44:54,020 --> 00:45:03,970
manage identities I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

892
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:07,510
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> how that's allowed that area</font>

893
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:13,279
experienced one of experience partners

894
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:15,050
supposedly cause Dave reached bed so

895
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,030
when a data breach occurs in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company</font>

896
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:19,910
comes out blame someone else do you

897
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:22,190
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone verifies that evening</font>

898
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:25,970
anyone can verify that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the HVAC vendor</font>

899
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:28,610
cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk escape route well we can</font>

900
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:32,990
finally the more compound report is

901
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:35,720
typing on paper anybody actually go like

902
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:38,089
a headline shall be the logs logs show

903
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:40,520
me the IP addressing show me where your

904
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:43,010
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> touches my network that the</font>

905
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:46,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">nitty gritty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> details up I don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

906
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:48,290
these companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> get on the get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the in</font>

907
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,839
front of the camera like any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other time</font>

908
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:53,900
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world it's about what's best for</font>

909
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:57,500
the company not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily true so you</font>

910
00:45:53,900 --> 00:46:03,220
gotta be careful with that that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font>

911
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:03,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">it one on one that got Estelle me</font>

912
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:08,750
or they just say you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it</font>

913
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:11,500
we paid you enough money over the last

914
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:13,880
20 years you're going to take this hit

915
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:19,970
the HVAC company didn't make a public

916
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:22,370
response that I know so I think that

917
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:26,419
that's a good that's a good modern look

918
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:29,589
at even taking into taking social out of

919
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:31,760
the process of validating a consumer or

920
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:35,920
ein side of the process of validating

921
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:38,480
the business now for businesses you have

922
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:43,250
what's what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name of the little</font>

923
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:45,200
company be done abressian private yet

924
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:47,300
you have done a<font color="#E5E5E5"> brass trees which you</font>

925
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,680
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give your VI in the sign up but</font>

926
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">when someone searches you they're not</font>

927
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,160
searching you from uni is researching

928
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:55,069
from your business name contact

929
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,660
information that's a good start but they

930
00:46:55,070 --> 00:47:00,710
don't necessarily compete with the

931
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:02,450
credit cards you know so it's it's it's

932
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:04,850
a great area it's a good thought

933
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:07,490
something to think about people like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

934
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:09,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">us can drive that kind of change if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

935
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:11,390
get that executive support and say hey

936
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:13,850
when you start doing things differently

937
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:15,980
in order to protect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> company and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

938
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:18,049
first organizations that do it are the

939
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:19,970
ones that that they're the pioneers

940
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:23,290
they're the ones that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set</font>

941
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:23,290
the stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> model for</font>

942
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:32,649
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a slightly different context</font>

943
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:35,500
press press<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you um I come from like</font>

944
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:38,140
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> line consumer customer service</font>

945
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:40,119
so just the way I understand it for more

946
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:42,640
of my job is simplicity for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

947
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:46,390
customers like number one for most execs

948
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:49,680
so like we say remove identification

949
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:52,750
from the you know to America customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

950
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,640
what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do to replace like Social</font>

951
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:56,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">Security numbers because again giving</font>

952
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,859
them a customer number customers don't

953
00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:01,720
remember things and I whoa<font color="#CCCCCC"> attest the</font>

954
00:47:59,859 --> 00:48:03,220
thousands of phone calls I've taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

955
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,709
do not remember things they create

956
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:07,779
themselves remember the social nothing

957
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:09,460
else that's on me that's an argument you

958
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:11,290
would have to overcome it's like cool

959
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,579
but now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customers won't like us</font>

960
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:16,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we make them remember something</font>

961
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:18,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">else I spend days and people Bruce let</font>

962
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:21,848
their passwords and they said five

963
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:28,869
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and it's really funny so so</font>

964
00:48:21,849 --> 00:48:30,849
I say that and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> response is oh man we</font>

965
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:32,920
don't want your social security numbers

966
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:35,500
that he stolen by Romanian hackers and

967
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">them buying yachts on your credit so we</font>

968
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,369
got rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that that's why you need</font>

969
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:43,000
executive support has to be driven from

970
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:46,859
the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it needs to be a campaign</font>

971
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:50,829
not hey here's our policy but hey we are

972

your social we don't have access to it

977
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:06,790
then when you do it from that level from

978
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:09,910
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top day it will be change but you'll</font>

there's this other stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

982

secret questions right give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the</font>

995
00:49:52,049 --> 00:49:55,529
being an issue to some customers how you
