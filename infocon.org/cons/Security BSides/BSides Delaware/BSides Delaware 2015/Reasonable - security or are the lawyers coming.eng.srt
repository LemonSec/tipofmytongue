response services we help people

18
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:59,050
determine the governance what is the

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,059
appropriate amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of spending what</font>

controls you have in place or that

00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:07,630
strategy stuff and the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> our gang</font>

22
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:09,220
commonly is are we spending enough are

we doing what we're supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing</font>

24
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:16,420
so that's what spawned this talk I'm

25
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,610
also a licensed attorney which makes me

26
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,770
really really slow at installing

27
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:24,369
software because I have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually read</font>

28
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:28,090
the contract but it also makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me think</font>

00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:31,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how what we do fits into bigger</font>

there are no<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuck-ups so here's an open</font>

41
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:13,260
question why do we pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

42
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:17,310
security cheaper than<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lawsuit right so</font>

43
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:23,929
it brings nothing to the bottom line we

44
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:27,000
buy information<font color="#E5E5E5"> security it's not free</font>

45
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:31,320
it's not the reason money it's not free

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,670
as an effort it's not comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

47
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:37,410
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will argue that in most times</font>

48
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:42,720
information security is<font color="#CCCCCC"> men- right</font>

49
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:45,060
because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get in the way of things hey</font>

50
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,910
we'd like to do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like</font>

51
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">my fears we've got this great marketing</font>

52
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,530
idea excites I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to startups because</font>

53
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,708
it's fun talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then pick up in</font>

54
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:58,680
new ideas like we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put SI p</font>

in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud it's like really you're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to put it out look that's that's</font>

57
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:09,480
how you could do that right after

58
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:12,330
working good um because cloud is awesome

59
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,929
ERP is awesome and that's something I

60
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:18,120
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to see but no we get in</font>

61
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:22,320
the way the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones who say no I</font>

62
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,750
don't think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good idea no maybe</font>

63
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,640
making a rocket<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of hair spray and a</font>

64
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,980
lighter is not an appropriate<font color="#E5E5E5"> than you</font>

65
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,859
do

66
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:35,140
two bedroom apartments right we are the

67
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:37,480
ones that bring the NOFA that's where

68
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,399
cause second sometimes we get in the way

69
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,890
of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> right we have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> improve</font>

70
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,709
things we have to get in the way of at

71
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:48,089
new grapes all 40 algorithms like I got

72
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,090
some serious problems with

73
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,629
confidentiality integrity and

74
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:57,940
availability of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that serve of that</font>

75
00:03:52,629 --> 00:04:01,000
system once it's rolled so we're

76
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:05,200
spending money so we don't spend more

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,260
money to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent lawsuits right so the</font>

78
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,569
idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you spend a dollar to save</font>

79
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,269
Morgan and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you spend a dollar to save</font>

80
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:15,548
any sense you're losing if you spend a

81
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:20,350
dollar to save a dollar twenty you're

82
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:23,740
winning putting that risk right because

83
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:26,440
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that clear by spending a dollar</font>

84
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:30,220
I save a dollar twenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> i buy the</font>

85
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,950
firewall say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I install firewall it's ten</font>

86
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:38,919
thousand dollars how should that say

87
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:43,450
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoa no you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know because did</font>

88
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:44,180
you absolutely remove that risk I don't

89
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,360
know

90
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:51,380
no is that long<font color="#CCCCCC"> no you can transfer</font>

91
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,690
their right good thing this way we're

92
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:56,780
here you body the thing you do the thing

93
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:59,270
you do the activity you and anything

94
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the most granular control we change</font>

95
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:04,969
the firewall rule all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way up to</font>

96
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:09,910
revamp our entire information<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:19,340
what we're bad Idzik waiting that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

99
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:23,090
dollar risk and it's not very lazy about

100
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:26,440
it because the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinks we want</font>

101
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:29,030
marginal benefit equal marginal costs

102
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,460
the idea is that you keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> spending money</font>

103
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:36,169
until it no longer makes economic value

104
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:39,320
we've all<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen that great afraid as you</font>

105
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,758
spend a dollar for security you get you

106
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,009
hope you're getting more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dollars</font>

107
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,720
worth of benefit until eventually you

108
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:48,560
start spending more money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you get</font>

109
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:52,789
less benefit you spend a dollar and you

110
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,099
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 cents worth of benefit and that's</font>

00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:57,229
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know every beginning management</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">interacting the problem is is that it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out what's the</font>

that new policy we've all seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

118
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,740
right probability x impact equals risk

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will call Wendy Heather when she</font>

it is a meaningless metric anyone ever

see any animals metric and you will

never collect a bunch of meaningless

to management with later what the hell

you look at my pretty graphs and koalas

make up a bunch of words like I am

systems I ran this fast in this far on

00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:36,089
the hamster wheel

165
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:44,800
we don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're measuring right</font>

166
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:47,050
we can't calculate probability<font color="#CCCCCC"> private</font>

167
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,130
because say for example you start with

168
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:56,339
those 10 volts you fixed eight are you

169
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:56,340
now what percentage are you more secure

170
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,190
you don't know even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though you've got</font>

171
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:07,000
nervous right you can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very naive</font>

172
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:08,740
approach and say we are now twenty

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,110
percent as vulnerable as we were when we

174
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:14,010
stopped because each runner building

175
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,960
maps exactly to a chance of<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting no</font>

I'm not going to say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

177
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,440
say we generated activities yeah can you

<font color="#CCCCCC">theoretically get some sort of idea I</font>

184
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:45,399
I imagine you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a model my</font>

that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make so many</font>

aren't born by a bigger chunk of data

190
00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:01,589
are what I bet the problem we run into

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,149
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of instances</font>

or someone else variants based on the

the parts and all that they've got

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,760
their model is much better than ours

210
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:51,480
because say we're going to consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

that you how much risk doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remove</font>

and eventually a calf be honest and say

now would it feels safer it feels better

some defense 65,000 hours and son we

don't know the measures we generally are

289
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:49,740
damages on which is entirely unlike

290
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:52,980
other kinds of risk I can price out the

291
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,780
value of a car accident to within ten

292
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:59,550
percent pretty easily because they're so

293
00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:01,470
common so we don't know what we

294
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned we can't believe measure we</font>

295
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have good models for measuring</font>

296
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,120
probability we need to know what the

297
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:12,030
impact is so thought of this come days

298
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,030
ago and room filled with smoke the floor

299
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:16,560
is a really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy right you're trying</font>

300
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,170
coincide what is that more money in

301
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:23,369
information security in a smart manager

302
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:25,530
says how much does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that get us you can</font>

303
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,570
either say well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

304
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:29,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">safer</font>

305
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:35,840
I think it's a good idea how much safer

306
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:37,970
I don't know somewhat that many I wish

307
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:41,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">goodbye to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security please I have for</font>

308
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:43,850
money so what's the minimum because

309
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,620
oftentimes is the conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to</font>

310
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:49,070
see your magic what's the least I can

311
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:51,650
get away with and before we usually view

312
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:53,540
that with contempt but you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,209

<font color="#E5E5E5">draw a box setting of what being able to</font>

315
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,790
wear one of those lines is kind of puts

316
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,840
everything else into perspective so I

317
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:05,660
don't know where I'm supposed to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

318
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:10,820
at least if I'm here I know where I am

319
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:12,620
so what's the minimum you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so</font>

320
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:16,490

321
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:18,230

00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know what the optimal is what's</font>

323
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:22,850
the optimal spend but you know the

324
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">bottom so if in doubt under your</font>

that way we allocated<font color="#E5E5E5"> the risk figure</font>

337
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:05,000
to work in smoke-filled room I have an

idea what it's going to cost me well so

339
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,439
that works when I talk about car

340
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:12,698
accidents I know the rough value of

341
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,920
running a car into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wall is going to be</font>

value the car like the medical expenses

343
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:23,809
plus some wiggle room I don't know what

are general public they're fair their

346
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:32,149
common enough and those are if you're if

347
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,919
you have management saying after a

348
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,410

I'm hoping to<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid and then it's</font>

354
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,870
several layers of abstraction away from

355
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:56,090
that that's why I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy a hundred</font>

thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars with zero and services</font>

357
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:03,980
from a consultant so it's hot contract

358
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,190
you've got contracts that our

359

association you want to handle payment

360

cards your contract essentially pcr that

means that everyone signed with everyone

00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,919
signed two bigs agreements before even

handle the time for example requiring

these rules either self-certification

you have this level of security premiums

been asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get copies of the writers</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">giving a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list of all the controls you</font>

have the advantage of this is it allows

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:22,880
me later on make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not give a pale</font>

you did this turns out you didn't well

decision which is I was going to be even

00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,570
like never signed that contract is you

413
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,950
didn't do this stuff up you didn't so

580
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:15,210
says we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to the court says</font>

581
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,389
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not setting a standard but you'll</font>

582
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:20,609
know it when you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the FTC comes</font>

583
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:24,330
around and says we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not setting a</font>

584
00:29:20,609 --> 00:29:28,859
standard either but we'll know it when

585
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:32,359
we see it so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this laughably low</font>

586
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:35,460
standard out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> wyndham minimum standard</font>

587
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:38,399

firewalls no feel and saturday day

589
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:46,408
knowing that the 101 stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wyndham</font>

590
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:49,279
wasn't doing and they got regulated

591
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:49,279
because they got fined

592
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:59,050
other stuff gets part of their extensive

593
00:29:53,770 --> 00:30:01,210
statement on their ssl security and then

594
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:03,520
even read that very cohesive are they

595
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:06,640
admit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> totally saves money for</font>

597
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,630
what's interesting though for Windham is

598
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:12,310
is the dis- that you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

599
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,980
any statements in all and still get

the time to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> your auto repairs the</font>

676
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,179
point is I'm showing real damages is

677
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,149
kind of hard there's a lot of times it's

678
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:30,700
absorbed by third parties showing you

679
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:32,380
damage just by that the inconvenience of

does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that work minor annoyances are</font>

684
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:47,830
generally not recognizable so what's

685
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:49,960
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the biggest changes to to</font>

686
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:52,120
our industry because writers we try to

establish this minimum stand now

688
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:57,460
assuming you are outside of<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCI</font>

lock the bicycle better be worth more

696
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:16,660
than on the bucks and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to</font>

quantify working on a date of going to

right you're entered director is gone

704
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,690
the backups are gone and anyone who's

done<font color="#E5E5E5"> administration was like oh cool</font>

706
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:44,640
that's that's a bad week but what's the

707
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,640
financial impact of that

708
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:51,279
what's the financial impact what did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

709
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:53,710
what did your company lose you lost

710
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,380
productivity but how much of that was

711
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:58,390
looking at pictures of reddit much of

712
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:00,520
that was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing your job and how</font>

713
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:04,078
much for that was actually you can point

714
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:06,280
to that and my argument for this is

715
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">target lost a bunch of money in the</font>

you've got a hundred dollars why for a

00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:28,490
$75 bike because then if that bike is is

still when you're too kind of feel to an

all the possible injury this causes I

00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:56,240
don't have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bike</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> signal and then that's</font>

754
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:05,300
be roughly commencer to the risk you and

755
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,130
we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume your bicycles a hundred</font>

another bicycle although ready roll

calculating that you can build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a model</font>

762
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:27,380
for our problems that we we're going

763
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:30,980
through multiple hoops<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trying to</font>

764
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:32,990
determine so it's by applying by

orbiters we go with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimum and then</font>

766
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:39,919
go up from there so let's go make the

00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:42,950
biggest changes to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment FDC</font>

after window the information security

plus reached my acura sultan defines and

770
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:53,720
that way you can go to manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> really say</font>

771
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:56,569
we have laughably bad security we can

772
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:58,549
actually get fined by the FTC they may

773
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:02,390
actually decide to go after us if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

774
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:04,310
big enough or egregious enough and there

775
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:07,980
were more shop set of bad security and

776
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:11,078
breaches than the FTC

777
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:14,349
but they may decide to pick it's like

778
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:16,480
speeding on 95 a lot of people are going

779

to do it someone's going to someone is

going to pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> for but they are now sort</font>

783
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:38,519
the standards low and undefined pretty

784
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:40,619
much not laughable you know it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

785
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:43,578
it's not the question of do we get the

because boards of directors<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

corporations are generally fairly

hey you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Board of Directors guys right</font>

840

00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:22,870
was dealt with one was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like are you fed</font>

questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come up with what are the</font>

982
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:32,990

983
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:34,640
frameworks you're expecting so that way

984
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:37,129
your mech you're reading your

985
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,660
contractual requirements and this is all

they're being a commonly accepted

989
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:48,819
this is what is expected

00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:57,950
of course recognize that when you were

00:49:53,760 --> 00:50:00,120
on the vendor assessment sending side

992
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:04,740

1062
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:37,330
seems to be the obvious one cuz there's

1063
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:39,040
going to be a think of the trade this

1064

you do revolves like

tougher vendor management standards you

1147
00:57:55,390 --> 00:58:01,808
the trade routes or its litigation where

you know you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you buy insurance</font>

1157
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:29,250
phased out to show that there's a

usually it's gotta be substantial it's

1165
00:58:46,569 --> 00:58:51,160
not like i<font color="#E5E5E5"> said my car was red and it</font>

my car had anti-lock brakes and it

1169
00:58:57,099 --> 00:59:01,390
didn't and the accident what could have

been mitigated by that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're a</font>

precision it's the materiality of the of

the correct statement to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be shorter than</font>

00:59:07,539 --> 00:59:12,869
the figure out the the risk they are

bearing my shorty

1175
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,119
do you see

1176
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:22,289
now

1177
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:24,359
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that let's say that you installed</font>

version<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 point out or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever the</font>

1179
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:28,810
standard is but meantime that's not the

1180
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:31,750
latest

1181
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:35,799
is that you see that is not going to be

1182
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:37,750
enough to get more trouble there might

1183
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:39,790
be a little I might get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more granular</font>

1184
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:41,440
than one or like that Monday they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

1185
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:43,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">brighter than I think along the stem so</font>

1186
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:46,450
he might be that you had some kind of

1187
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:48,780
patch management system and whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">not that was an acceptable restaurant</font>

1189
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:53,050
would just be<font color="#CCCCCC"> contemporanea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> standards</font>

1190
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:55,720
like most people had shifted before

1191
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:58,390
pointer yet because then you're going to

1192
00:59:55,720 --> 01:00:01,149
like two parallel problems I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1193
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:04,270
fun we get rid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those laws are</font>

1194
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:07,450
presented by handling parallel problems

1195
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:16,590
with a standard versus common usage was

1196
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:16,589
this is this inherently negligible sorry

1197
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:23,330
oh thank you so much
