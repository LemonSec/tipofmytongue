speakers organizers and audience in

75
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:09,940
unholy chaos and matrimony first a

76
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:14,989
reading from the book of cyber

77
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:19,190
conference one slides 2 to 22 in the

78
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:22,580
beginning God sometimes called Brian had

79
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:25,670
an idea this idea was to be called be

80
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,530
size Liverpool but then God got busy and

81
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,220
so be size Liverpool stayed an idea on a

82
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:33,950
post-it note and all was good with God

83
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:37,280
but lo another God looked upon this and

84
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:41,239
was not happy with God Brian and so

85
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:46,430
sowed an idea this God was to be known

86
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:48,950
as GN and so it came to be that two gods

87
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:56,780
had ideas of b-sides and so besides was

88
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:59,390
born in Liverpool not Everton but then B

89
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:03,770
sighs Liverpool was struck a blow by the

90
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:06,109
evil Satan to be known as life for life

91
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:13,459
got in the way and so the gods looked

92
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:15,920
for a savior they looked up the

93
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:19,760
Twitter's and they found a friend a

94
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,430
colleague but not a savior for he was

95
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:29,480
known as Stuart sometimes called Spock

96
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:32,270
and he was special so so many since and

97
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,640
so three musketeers Porthos Athos and

98
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,710
Aramis rode like three of the horse Four

99
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,450
Horsemen of the Apocalypse orbit on

100
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,359
donkeys that may or may not have been

101
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:43,990
drunk before taking on their passengers

102
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:48,680
that's actually from one of our chats

103
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:50,870
and from over the hillside arrived a man

104
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,909
a man of such amazing talents that his

105
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,430
theme tune with a theme tune from

106
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:57,919
Brookside and so Richard arrived to

107
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,509
build websites to fix logos can she

108
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,729

people's ramblings into a beautiful

110
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:11,840

111
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:17,330
website applaud his work and booze and

112
