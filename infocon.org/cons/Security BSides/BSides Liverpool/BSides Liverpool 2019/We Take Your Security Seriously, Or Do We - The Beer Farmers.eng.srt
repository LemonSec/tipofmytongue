1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,039
absolutely good so we're two of the six

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:13,230
be farmers six yeah there are six beer

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:15,030
farmers we're the fat ones so anybody's

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,700
seen as in the last six months know that

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,500
we we carry a parental advisory that

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,570
says comment a lot isn't here today so

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,509
that's good but if you are under the age

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,970
of 18 then we do swear a little bit but

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,039
we try and keep it relevant in keeping

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,580
with what we're talking about

11
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:34,920
so I said there were six members rarely

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,140
rarely John turns up his Belgian he's

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,580
got a real hatred to the UK yeah why

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,960
wouldn't you rumors that he sandbox

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:45,239
escaper are not true well yeah Christy

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,390
Morgan she's a recent addition to the

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,090
team and myself so can I just talk

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,280
quickly story okay cool so we were

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,760
speculating in a fight between Jenny and

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,800
Chrissie which one would win and what we

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,839
felt was is it would probably go to

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,849
Jenny but Chrissy doesn't fight fair so

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,250
she would like shank her before even the

24
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,630
fight started so jury's still out on

25
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,920
that one we did actually have that

26
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,990
conversation should actually have that

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:16,679
conversation with the two cops that we

28
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:20,280

37
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,609
burgers so so a bit about who we are

38
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,169
gonna flick through yeah I I send a lot

39
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:44,640
of emails to people in sends what we

40
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,729
most people yeah they put me in charge

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:55,259
of somebody yeah we manage things I'm

42
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:59,119
entering this way yeah okay so we've

43
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:02,070
dropped this slide back in have a look

44
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,990
I'm glad that Lonnie got along and

45
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,240
you're laughing because you resonate it

46
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,329
resonates with you yeah resonates with

47
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,319
you so Mark Zuckerberg years and years

48
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:15,150
ago when Facebook was a in its youth

49
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,339
said that he felt that previously was a

50
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,739
social norm of the past and I think as

51
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,170
time has progressed and as Facebook is

52
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,660
matured and they haven't really matured

53
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,569
right though they're still doing some

54
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,190
pretty shady stuff yeah and it's

55
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,260
interesting because they're very

56
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,910
hypocritical right they've got a lawyer

57
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,220
that's basically saying things like

58
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,620
privacy is you know a thing of the past

59
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,170
and then you got mark asking for

60
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,180
regulation of giant social media

61
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,660
companies because they wield too much

62
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,090
power

63
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,090
right so you you've got you've got this

64
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:51,600
weird dichotomy of opinions

65
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,459
I honestly think that and I read this

66
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,579
somewhere was it was some sort of thing

67
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,799
about mark and Facebook and it's that

68
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,280
the board would actually like to punt

69
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:03,930
him from the car yeah and and the board

70
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,040
is actually talking about breaking up

71
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:10,380
Facebook really and this is because this

72
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,858
guy is just completely unrepentant about

73
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:17,010
a full-scale I'm gonna say assault on

74
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:18,989
democracy and as well as the full-scale

75
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,030
selling of all of this personal

76
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:24,180
sensitive information yeah completely

77
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,430
agree yeah that lawyers Ian said came

78
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,410
out said users should not have social

79
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,120
media social media in general should not

80
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,709
have any expectation of privacy because

81
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,720
they signed up to it fully in the

82
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:37,019
knowledge the data will be used in

83
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,239
whatever way the platform chooses but we

84
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,010
don't read the T's and C's and it should

85
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,239
be more of a we should we should be more

86
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,500
conscious our eyes should be wide open

87
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,209
when we're getting involved with these

88
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,920
kind of guys because we're getting folks

89
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,810
you know there's so much anecdotal

90
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,369
evidence that suggests that Facebook

91
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,489
especially when you log in with Facebook

92
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,500
or if you have Facebook open and you're

93
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,000
buying products and that kind of thing

94
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,829
that all of that data is being siphoned

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,220
up and all that data is being thrown

96
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:05,160
back to Facebook to push ads to you

97
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,449
right to push shots and also you know a

98
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,720
and then I'm gonna get a little

99
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:11,580
political for a moment okay nom but in

100
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,410
Ireland it was just

101
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,019
cently revealed that Facebook

102
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:19,950
deliberately censored one voice in the

103
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:22,650
abortion issues in Ireland that's

104
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,289
obviously very divisive issue in in

105
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:29,489
Ireland but Facebook made the deliberate

106
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:31,800
choice to quash ads for one side of the

107
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,200
debate yeah yeah

108
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,650
so we do this every talk quick show of

109
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:41,250
hands who's got a Facebook account yeah

110
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,870
quiet yes number of the room who deleted

111
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,430
their Facebook account when they start

112
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,370
to become more acutely aware of what

113
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,580
this guy and his company we're doing a

114
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,730
few people hashtag delete Facebook right

115
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,890
okay

116
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,900
it's interesting because the perception

117
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:56,940
is that they're evil okay and that's not

118
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,409
a great look for any organization they

119
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,730
are continually trying to remove him

120
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,160
from the top of the organization but

121
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:04,380
will they will not remove the ethics of

122
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,110
the organization I question yeah

123
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,980
absolutely man that's a huge issue so

124
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,590
they're getting kicked in the ass

125
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,840
financially now so don't if you read it

126
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,760
but recently they have to make a profit

127
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,789
adjustment of around between three and

128
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,740
five billion u.s. dollars and that's a

129
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,000
fine that they're expecting to have to

130
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,330
pay to the the Federal Trade Commission

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,030
over in the US and that fine is against

132
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,669
their privacy practice that's right so I

133
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:32,609
never said right there's another also

134
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:35,729
issues before the European Court or

135
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,400
Ireland Court with regards to Facebook

136
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,290
and its GDP our relationship it is

137
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,640
slowly moving its way through the courts

138
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:47,580
you know I I can't I can't

139
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,340
like back this enough because I think

140
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,590
it's dangerous to use this information

141
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,869
in a really harmful way for a lot of

142
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,909
people out there and they're unaware

143
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,350
that they're being manipulated I mean

144
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,270
everyone here knows they're being

145
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,310
manipulated because they're at b-sides

146
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:07,560
right so but it's everyone else out

147
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:09,350
there II yeah yeah okay I forgot to

148
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:16,440
mention at the start the talk actually

149
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:18,750
it's a vendor talk this yeah because we

150
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,890
like taking the person really killing

151
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,090
vendors okay

152
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,770
that's the only reason it's a vendor

153
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,630
thought yeah that kind of happened to us

154
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,370
because we did besides London and guess

155
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,440
what their face

156
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:32,930
recruiting desk was just outside of our

157
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:34,820
talk awkward yeah we got away with it I

158
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,570
think yeah I think we go I don't think

159
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:41,810
any of them join us in our talk yeah

160
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:45,020
okay who's this oh come on you know this

161
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,550
crazy guy Jack Dorsey alright Jack

162
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,599
Dorsey is the Mark Zuckerberg of Twitter

163
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,690
okay

164
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,580
and they appear to be lower key really

165
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,680
when it comes to egregious previously

166
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:58,698
behavior they don't make the news quite

167
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:01,910
as regularly as Facebook but they've got

168
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:05,479
an average active user base of 330

169
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:07,400
million users monthly users and guess

170
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:11,330
how many users got that date are exposed

171
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,940
in 2018 330 million every single active

172
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:17,510
user had their data exposed in a breach

173
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,919
Twitter or as Troy said in London he had

174
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,020
to correct me it wasn't technically a

175
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:23,210
breach it was a backup that it was

176
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,979
created and left on the on the Internet

177
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,909
and he's got that backup if they ever

178
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:30,680
need it restoring very not I think the

179
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:34,160
other thing I want to just throw in

180
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,979
about Twitter is the fact that a lot of

181
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,289
like there's a bot problem on Twitter it

182
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:41,180
was revealed that Russians had set up a

183
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:43,580
whole bunch of bots to tweet and retweet

184
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:49,849
very divisive issues during the 2016

185
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:51,200
election also via via brexit right so so

186
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:52,909
one of the problems that we have and

187
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,280
it's actually an InfoSec problem too

188
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:58,520
yeah I mean you know what has been your

189
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,179
experience on Twitter with some folks

190
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:05,289
are we do want to talk about felon or no

191
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:08,930
briefly yeah yeah okay so this asshole

192
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:11,599
racist misogynist it decides to weigh in

193
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,490
on an issue with my man Mike over there

194
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:17,360
and let's just say it didn't end well

195
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:19,130
for him at all I think this is a real

196
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,370
problem that we have if we want to have

197
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:24,800
an inclusive group what we need to do is

198
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:27,110
stop polarizing it that our biggest

199
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,090
problem in InfoSec recruiting is not the

200
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,300
number of people out there it's the

201
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,880
toxicity of this particular organ a

202
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:36,890
group of people you don't have a whole

203
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,900
bunch of accountants weighing on Twitter

204
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:41,330
and smashing people

205
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,250
like that doesn't happen doesn't really

206
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,410
happen with nurses and doctors but for

207
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,540
some reason and InfoSec we get to sit

208
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,329
back and somebody with a new idea or

209
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,099
whatever and we just try to show at them

210
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,200
and then that goes into this echo

211
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,090
chamber that makes everybody feel super

212
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,250
uncomfortable right I mean if you've

213
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:01,850
ever asked a question on Stack Overflow

214
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:04,850
as a young programmer that experience is

215
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:07,490
awful in fact you know can end in tears

216
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:10,610
right gosh tech tears yeah absolutely

217
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,290
yeah be nice to people WD we'll come on

218
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,310
to that in a little while so we just

219
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,890
want a little bit of a freestyle

220
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:17,329
conversation about Google okay so they

221
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,770
can't be far away from the headlines but

222
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,060
they're not often in the headlines the

223
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:22,730
stuff that we just talked about but

224
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:26,719
they're every bit as bad as Facebook

225
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:29,540
when it comes to your privacy so it's

226
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,810
how we saw Mandy it's how we saw Mandy

227
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,819
or Travis as we call it drivers

228
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,650
it's a project zero researcher and he

229
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,350
was sitting on a vulnerability he

230
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:43,430
discovered in in Microsoft Windows 10

231
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:46,640
yeah so TLDR Google researcher found how

232
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:51,050
to break windows really honestly that's

233
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,600
what it was yeah yep so project zeros

234
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,939
got a ninety day grace period before

235
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,250
they'll go full disclosure got today 91

236
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,600
and he went full disclosure despite the

237
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,760
fact that Microsoft had said we've got a

238
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,290
fix for this but we're not entirely sure

239
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,000
of the integrity of the fix when it's

240
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:07,130
deployed into production we'd like a

241
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,110
little bit more time so we're not gonna

242
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,870
do it in this Patch Tuesday we're gonna

243
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:13,520
do it in that patch Tuesday and just to

244
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,380
give you an example of this too and this

245
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,480
is where I think we could do a better

246
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,910
job of getting the word out about these

247
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,950
type of vulnerabilities so in this case

248
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:26,480
it was like a corrupted certificate

249
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:28,310
issue that basically it it poached one

250
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,180
of the crypto services on your windows

251
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:34,459
box which literally the fix restart that

252
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:37,819
service didn't bring down the box it was

253
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,500
no remote code execution wasn't it's

254
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,060
kind of a zero date right but like I

255
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,190
said there's plenty of ways that you can

256
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,439
break in windows box right delete a

257
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,160
bunch of registry keys rename a bunch of

258
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,420
dll's

259
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,500
like so I'm like saying 91 days plus and

260
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,300
you're just basically a giant day

261
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,980
you are and don't talk to me about zero

262
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,800
down Windows 10 when you've got fleets

263
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:02,880
to use Travis's term all the the the

264
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,650
articles term when you've got fifty

265
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,730
thousand Windows Server 2008 machine

266
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,800
selling the Internet

267
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:10,740
okay that's not the zero day that's zero

268
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,140
with years of days months whatever fix

269
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,790
that problem zero days a very novel very

270
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,710
actually in very few cases do they could

271
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,839
present a material problem to an

272
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,790
organization so I run a poll on Twitter

273
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,200
just saying actually it was a bit of a

274
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,610
fight between Google and Microsoft who

275
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,560
do you trust the least and the answer

276
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,230
was overwhelmingly people trust Google

277
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,910
less than Microsoft and I would take on

278
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,860
this and take is that I think that

279
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,660
Microsoft we're more mature organization

280
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,760
they've been around a lot longer okay

281
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,589
they've got clever engineering teams

282
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,700
they understand the idea of the software

283
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:43,080
development lifecycle and it's difficult

284
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,390
rolling out a patch for a problem is not

285
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,420
things don't overnight I think they were

286
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:50,010
responsible when they went back to

287
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,839
Google and said we need more time yeah

288
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,510
with that certificate issue it affected

289
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,250
as sequel installations right and

290
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,720
bringing down sequel boxes is bad news

291
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:02,040
there's no question about that but

292
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:04,110
honestly it's like how many sequel boxes

293
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,360
are gonna get you know hit with this

294
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,190
thing remotely over the Internet the

295
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,110
answer is if your sequel boxes are on

296
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,030
the internet you have way more serious

297
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:15,960
problems than a corrupted certificate

298
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:18,870
yeah definitely okay so we always drop

299
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,970
this one in the talks and basically just

300
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,470
to highlight the problem of the amount

301
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:24,810
of data that is out there and this is

302
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,400
gnome data so we think there are a

303
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,420
gazillion more records out there that we

304
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,670
don't know about because it's not

305
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,530
surfaced anywhere yet but I find it's

306
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,699
really useful and impactful at work

307
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:35,430
because when you look at it you think

308
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:38,460
shit I'm in here not in just one place

309
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:43,459
I'm here everywhere okay mariette being

310
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:46,460
the example of in gold customer gold

311
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,460
alright

312
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:52,170
we got to pick up the pace a little bit

313
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:55,800
but unhackable is my trigger word okay

314
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:57,780
oh my favorite thing though was the you

315
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,319
guys will see this on Twitter that PC

316
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:03,959
that is is they took out a patent for

317
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,710
unhackable PC yeah it's it's actually

318
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:09,970
filled with concrete and sad

319
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:11,529
yes okay so you know it's just that like

320
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,350
they stop with the marketing department

321
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:16,930
like you as security leaders you need to

322
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,279
call them out you know you need to call

323
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:21,339
them out when they do shit like that yes

324
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:22,779
right yeah yeah absolutely right we have

325
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:24,100
a lot of fun with this because we work I

326
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:26,200
said we work we're good friends with

327
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,610
penthouse partners yeah let's be clear

328
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,410
there is no emotional engagement between

329
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,510
the two organizations where they just do

330
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,079
all of the good tackle we may have fun

331
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,310
with it right

332
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,740
yeah we're sort of like those dung

333
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,029
beetles yeah yeah all right so there's a

334
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,980
bit of a musical theme going on now

335
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:40,630
because we're in in Liverpool which is

336
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,610
the home of rock and roll as far as the

337
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,779
UK is concerned and there are some

338
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,690
people doing good stuff

339
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:48,700
okay so passwords it's a constant menace

340
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,890
really in the in for set community and

341
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,380
the industry at large but the here stay

342
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:55,060
for at least a long time yeah so we've

343
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,740
got to get clever about how we do

344
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,899
password management and how we educate

345
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:01,690
users around users around

346
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:03,610
good password hygiene we have to have

347
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,770
the FA debate we'll talk about this

348
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,720
regularly so if you are a responsible

349
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,880
organization and you can support NFA

350
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,980
then you should deploy out to your user

351
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,310
base absolutely and if you want great

352
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:18,610
advice as a user I'll take up that

353
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:21,760
option and that have I been pawned API

354
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:25,600
and warning for the domains like who

355
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:28,839
here's 11 have I been pawned yeah okay

356
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,810
awesome okay cool who's really sad that

357
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,300
it's probably gonna be sold yeah I know

358
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,069
what can we do right although we had a

359
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,680
really good chat with Troy about it and

360
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,480
I'm really like hey Troy why don't you

361
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,859
just like donate it to the EF a for

362
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:48,880
something like that right I said I'd

363
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:50,200
give him 50 quid for it yeah okay as

364
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,670
professionals were not perfect as

365
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,260
organisations we're not perfect we do

366
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,400
make mistakes we do issue boogie code

367
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,950
and that's something that happens all

368
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,839
the time but tell companies about it

369
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,130
responsibly okay we're gonna move on

370
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:02,290
around a little bit more detail and the

371
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,339
time we've got left but if you do get

372
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,010
sold you've got a problem with your

373
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:08,110
software and it's a severe the risk is

374
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:09,640
severe then fix it okay it's incumbent

375
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,140
on you to fix a problem that somebody

376
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,270
has been responsible enough to tell you

377
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,550
about not just hack you the Nicky day

378
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:17,560
and stick it all up ace but yeah

379
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,959
ignoring the problem doesn't make it go

380
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,660
hey trust

381
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,969
it doesn't test a fixie stuff so again

382
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,490
you know have conversations with people

383
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,500
that build things if your insecurities

384
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:32,110
have those adult conversations upfront

385
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,670
with them get them baking stuff in early

386
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,250
doors okay

387
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,899
there's no excuse really we are security

388
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,560
professionals in the front seat of

389
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:40,149
Technology

390
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,189
we're not they have to thaw all the guys

391
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:43,660
again at last stop just before that

392
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,250
boogie codes been released into the wild

393
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,810
we should be there at the beginning how

394
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,700
about those conversations yeah and I

395
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,140
mean I just want to echo Josh Corman who

396
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,640
basically said you know we have a

397
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,569
hundred percent failure rate in

398
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,970
cybersecurity

399
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:56,760
yeah hundred percent almost every major

400
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,350
company has been breached at some point

401
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:05,290
so yeah this becomes really important

402
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:07,870
it's irritant right because the your

403
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:09,760
environment is always changing stuff is

404
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,440
new stuffs coming in old stuffs going

405
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,350
out it's always changing it's recursive

406
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,339
and it'll learn from your mistakes yeah

407
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,990
but you know here because you want to

408
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:18,760
get involve with the community that's

409
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,930
the whole thing about these sides is

410
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,490
it's not vendor heavy

411
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,839
it's about people that feel the same way

412
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,700
came together and talking and sharing

413
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:30,820
their problems and learning new things

414
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:35,860
so long live b-sides okay you see what I

415
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:39,310
did there yeah good so a breach is a

416
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:42,040
when not if actually many people in this

417
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,420
room will already or will work for

418
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,930
organizations who've already had that

419
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:49,420
date breached okay just get over it and

420
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:51,489
deal with it okay because it'll feel

421
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:54,250
like that a bit more music Manchester

422
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:56,110
that's where I come from you will panic

423
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,180
yeah and it'll fill at the end of the

424
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,160
world and they'll fill a lot in your

425
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,979
head because we all mess up but actually

426
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,629
what we're defined by is our response

427
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,459
okay so a good data breach response

428
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,319
actually results in people having more

429
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,660
trust in your organization which is a

430
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,970
bit of a paradox but that's true all

431
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,939
I'll ask there any question right here

432
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:18,040
Andy going out to our brother Andy

433
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:20,290
always likes to ask this question who

434
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,480
heard of the Equifax data brochure nandi

435
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:25,839
Jose Shawn I'm shit with me mix them up

436
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,650
yeah like our Fred our tour manager

437
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,220
hey yeah so Equifax almost everybody has

438
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,260
heard of it

439
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,240
right and it's the

440
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,950
breech that keeps on giving right to

441
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,900
because they just got their credit

442
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:41,430
downright downgraded recently as well

443
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:44,730
right who heard it it was discuss data

444
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:46,890
breach few people way less people right

445
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,480
because they handled their shit they

446
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:51,450
went out they said we got a problem

447
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,480
we've fixed it we've isolated the

448
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,100
problem we want you to do this thank you

449
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,450
very much if you have any concerns here

450
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,090
where here's where you can contact us

451
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:01,080
it's this is not rocket science it's

452
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:05,550
gonna happen

453
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:07,470
Equifax made page one of the news from

454
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,649
front page of the news it made this six

455
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:13,350
o'clock news discussed on page 17 it got

456
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,570
their executives dragged into Congress

457
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,379
to testify about what ice walls they are

458
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,689
yeah agreed

459
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,950
so when it happens you really just gotta

460
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,330
accept you that's you start pointing

461
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,670
it's about being you've got a problem

462
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:26,520
okay then you can start dealing with it

463
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:28,170
moving on in a positive fashion don't

464
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,940
blame the other guy because your control

465
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,360
failed that led the other guy to steal

466
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,910
your data okay that's the bottom line

467
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,800
argue with me outside if you'd like to

468
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:39,000
get support so in the UK we've got some

469
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,600
pretty powerful bodies we've got the

470
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,790
NCSC

471
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,860
who a lot better than they used to be

472
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,420
that's per se and they've got some

473
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,409
clever people and capable people that

474
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,590
will come and actually offer you

475
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:52,470
computer emergency stuff you've got to

476
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:54,659
tell the ICO in the UK it's horrible if

477
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,160
you don't okay they are the Supervisory

478
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,040
body when it comes to data protection in

479
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,690
the UK but again if you tell them then

480
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,100
parachute people in and their commitment

481
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,120
people and then come and help you with

482
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,500
things like your instant response

483
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:10,199
planning notifying users or if you've

484
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,390
got heavy duty risk I mean there's more

485
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,640
than a few awesome security companies

486
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:17,040
here in the UK right yeah there's a lot

487
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,870
of talent out there i I think you know

488
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,510
sometimes businesses want to keep it you

489
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,040
know on the DL as much as possible may

490
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,330
not want to go up to the police right

491
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,250
away because you don't know what's going

492
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:29,330
on there's great talent here in the UK

493
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:31,440
yeah I'm steady absolutely right

494
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:34,770
analyze this problem figure out where

495
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,570
that control broke or fell over yeah

496
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,220
was it something in your SDLC was there

497
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,929
something not baked in at design-time

498
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,760
yeah where architectural decisions are

499
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:44,370
not taken that were correct did someone

500
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,340
turn off security on their s3 bucket

501
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,389
till it worked yeah oops a common

502
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,459
problem and learn from it

503
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,080
yeah and ultimately just take it on the

504
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,400
chin because you can't undo what has

505
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,139
happened but what you can do is your

506
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,260
very level best to prevent it from

507
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:02,000
happening again and if you do that trust

508
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:04,470
will come back in the case of discus

509
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,480
good example of that is north car drove

510
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,580
so they had a really serious problem

511
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,470
they I think was around somewhere attack

512
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,639
took them their entire business was

513
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,940
second offline there a huge element

514
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,260
manufacturer they have people but from

515
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,850
all over the business pulling together

516
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,649
no matter whether they were senior

517
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,120
executives are worried they were doing

518
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:24,120
everything they could to manually

519
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,379
continue that company's operation but

520
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,049
what they did was they responded really

521
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,159
well so they their IT systems were down

522
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:30,450
but what they did was surfers your

523
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:31,770
websites that kept the flow of

524
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,720
information to customers and

525
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:36,029
shareholders and people cared flowing

526
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,770
nicely a bit Heath Robinson but it's

527
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:39,570
better than nothing and actually it

528
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:42,029
demonstrated that they gave a shit okay

529
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:45,480
so in a very similar case our friends

530
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:47,250
back at Google were involved I think it

531
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,929
might have actually been this one where

532
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,090
the business started to set up a whole

533
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:52,799
bunch of Google accounts and basically

534
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,779
Google turned off so they're in the

535
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,639
middle of a crisis Google turned off

536
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:59,970
their accounts because they had too many

537
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,679
counts and they felt it was business so

538
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,830
they turned them off and demanded a

539
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:08,940
bunch of payment yeah absolute Dick's

540
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:11,158
talking of which okay I'm gonna do this

541
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:15,679
one quick do correctly okay so sandbox

542
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:19,080
escaper we know very angry individual

543
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,750
it appears that she was under

544
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,070
investigation it really moves me this is

545
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,360
like the saddest moment and

546
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,830
vulnerability disclosure where

547
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:30,469
somebody's been kicked around so much

548
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:33,779
has maybe mental issues mental problems

549
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:36,720
very angry at the world and is trying to

550
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:39,120
call out intelligence agencies justice

551
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,059
and law enforcement and dropping like

552
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,399
zero day after zero day and threatening

553
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:47,190
to sell it to the enemies of the United

554
00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:49,199
States so you know my heart goes out to

555
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,760
people that are getting so angry and so

556
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,640
lonely that they do stuff like that

557
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,158
because they're looking for suicide by

558
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,560
air force at that point we all know what

559
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,380
happened to trick

560
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:03,200
gentlemen from burning ham here and he

561
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:06,080
got vaporized by a predator due to his

562
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,910
belief in building the cyber Caliphate

563
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,970
and conducting cybersecurity attacks

564
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:13,070
right ransomware attacks specifically so

565
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:15,350
you know it's it's sad when we lose

566
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,600
people like that who I kind of feel like

567
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,800
if they had just reached out you know

568
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,510
it's not the end of the world man

569
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,800
there's there's a lot of stuff you can

570
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:24,050
do and there's a lot of money you could

571
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,000
make as well to being that talented I

572
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:28,370
have certainly the skill sets there I

573
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,370
agree I think there is there is a long

574
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:33,919
journey between responsible disclosure

575
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,419
back to Microsoft and sticking it all

576
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,070
out on a paste okay

577
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,620
I do believe there are things that you

578
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:43,000
can do that are in the middle ground

579
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:47,149
there so yeah we'll see

580
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,340
no matter unhackable don't make false

581
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,090
claims about the unhak ability of your

582
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,830
technology

583
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,600
if you think it's unhackable then just

584
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,909
think it's unhackable don't ever tell

585
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,100
anybody it's unhackable made us rule

586
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,090
number one because we know that there

587
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,490
are people out there that are very

588
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:03,679
clever cleverer than you and not you

589
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:05,300
you and your unhackable tower that will

590
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,710
destroy that unhackable status in a

591
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:10,250
matter of days and that's if you're

592
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:12,590
lucky okay be incredibly careful about

593
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:15,650
the idea of dropping personal data on

594
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:17,689
security searches onto twitter if they

595
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:20,800
would rather that their privacy

596
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:23,530
I mean Elysee was preserved in one way

597
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:30,409
I'm sure you know who I'm talking about

598
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:32,240
Brian Kevin Ryan a cab good friends

599
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,100
and have a bear respects you know you're

600
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,350
all here because you cool yeah I think

601
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,610
so we've all got anxiety Zhai have

602
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:40,699
things that keep me awake around

603
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:41,959
security but I respect that

604
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,340
others have got their own opinions and

605
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,280
their own skill sets and own knowledge

606
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,330
areas and you wouldn't be here really I

607
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,460
don't think you won't be in this room

608
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:53,689
and in this conference if you didn't

609
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:56,360
care give a shit right pop quiz can

610
00:23:53,690 --> 00:24:01,880
anybody tell me why I've put that

611
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:05,080
picture on that slide nobody can tell me

612
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,760
and I'm in Liverpool Wow sorry

613
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,409
fantastic so Orchestral Manoeuvres in

614
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,240
the dark or a Liverpool based electro

615
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,890
pop band from the late 70s

616
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,330
I think the spell operating even today

617
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:18,350
had a hit called Enola Gay the analogy

618
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,029
here is that they all thought it was

619
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,370
great out here but what we know the

620
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:28,730
gauge it was vaporize 140 12,000 people

621
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:31,600
in Hiroshi were in August 1945 okay and

622
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:33,200
I don't know how we did it but we did it

623
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,730
yeah we're done

624
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,250
what does it say thanks very much I know

625
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:41,649
you were looking for a crescendo but no

626
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,649
we're out we'll see at the barrio
