1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,899
now obviously I had a look through the

2
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,320
the speaker profiles and then saw

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,790
obviously Omri was on before me and

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,500
inspirational speaker traveled the world

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,110
and then I thought okay little old me

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,720
after that I could I can cope I can cope

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,730
so today what I'm looking to cover is a

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,099
bit of to be honest it's it's a bit of

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,560
career advice I've been in tech nearly

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,859
20 years I've worked for lots of

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,330
different companies I enjoy the

12
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,949
technical side but I suppose more

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,870
recently been doing a lot more of the

14
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,729
management side of things and actually

15
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,510
what I find really exciting is

16
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:41,519
developing and coaching young and old

17
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,710
staff and making sure I get the absolute

18
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:46,680
best out of everybody I can possibly get

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,280
so at the moment I'm working over in

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,269
Liverpool been there just over a year

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,309
started as a consultant to do a

22
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:55,290
transformation hopefully a few of you

23
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:59,309
have heard the football pools they've

24
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:00,839
been going 96 years but they're going

25
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,820
through somewhat a digital

26
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:05,880
transformation so we're going from

27
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,890
people still posting in a coupe on every

28
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,420
week with some selections of which

29
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,500
matches they thinks going to be scored

30
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,530
roars through to a modern day fun and

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,780
leisure sort of gambling company so what

32
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,120
I'll do today it's like I say a little

33
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,620
bit of advice over the years but what

34
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,010
I'd like is some questions right the way

35
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:28,050
through as well so I'm going to touch

36
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,660
upon some of the things I love some of

37
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:33,179
the bits I hate a little bit about me

38
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,920
probably a bit too much about me as far

39
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,950
as all of you are concerned but I do

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,250
enjoy talking about myself and then it's

41
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,500
just a top ten tips of sort of a career

42
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,960
in tech how to get into it how to

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,020
advance yourself some of these tips will

44
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,940
be you know known to everybody some will

45
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,589
hopefully help even if you can just take

46
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:57,090
a couple of little tips away I'd be

47
00:01:52,590 --> 00:02:00,390
made-up and then how to keep in touch so

48
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,979
the things I love I do love tack but I

49
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,560
love people more and I love the

50
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,080
community communication connecting with

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,970
people learning everybody should be

52
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,520
learning on almost a daily basis if

53
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:14,010
you're not something's wrong this is not

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,450
the career for you mentoring and

55
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,069
coaching I do a lot of mentoring

56
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,619
do a lot of coaching with different

57
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:23,019
organizations and I'll talk a bit

58
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,720
through that I love martial arts as well

59
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,819
questions volunteer and very very long

60
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,580
PowerPoint lists is also a big favor to

61
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:33,880
my so that the things I hate is I don't

62
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,319
like cheese now please I know everybody

63
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,600
get with cheese really yes

64
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:39,339
hate it can't stand it I get cheese free

65
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,049
pizzas and before you ask the barbecue

66
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,720
sauce holds the contents together quite

67
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,489
nicely so don't worry about that

68
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,250
laziness and people that don't want to

69
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:50,680
listen people that just genuinely don't

70
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,840
want to learn I can't comprehend those

71
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,950
types of people I think you know if

72
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,220
you're gonna work in technology you

73
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,780
really do need to learn on a daily basis

74
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,600
keyboards without green back lights it's

75
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,060
just it's just a no and also wonderful

76
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,970
stock photos of what hackers really look

77
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,470
like in the real world I'm sure a few of

78
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,540
you have used these in presentations

79
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,819
that you've done so a little bit about

80
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,459
me and I did say a little bit about me

81
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:18,518
so this is one of my first days of work

82
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:19,450
at Chester Zoo so I was I was there for

83
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,850
about 14 years

84
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,910
so saw lots of different animals I've

85
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,380
got lots of stories I've got some health

86
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,910
and safety things that I won't put on

87
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,690
video but if you want to come and see me

88
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:35,109
later and happily talk about firstly I

89
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:37,090
got an e at GCSE IT so the idea of this

90
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:39,940
is of me telling you this is to say that

91
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,220
look while school is important it really

92
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,590
isn't the be-all and end-all you know I

93
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,480
I then managed to get talked my way into

94
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,820
college a bit of early social

95
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,820
engineering and then I was asked to

96
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:54,220
leave after about six months and I

97
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,590
managed to get myself an apprenticeship

98
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,530
luckily otherwise it probably would have

99
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:02,049
gone down a different path and then I

100
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,459
just worked my ass off really I mean to

101
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:06,130
be honest I think everybody that works

102
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:08,140
in tech or anybody that has a good

103
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,670
career intact tends to find that they're

104
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,140
doing something absolutely every day

105
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,850
they're pushing themselves they're

106
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,708
always learning new things and without

107
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,238
that really you're probably in the wrong

108
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:19,720
game um

109
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:22,719
I obviously then over compensated for

110
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,760
the lack of education so I then went and

111
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,750
got became a chartered fellow with the

112
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,930
BCS and got my sis as well and again

113
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,880
these are

114
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,570
fan of certification for the right

115
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,000
reasons so don't do it to overcompensate

116
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,820
and just to put a label on yourself do

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,720
it because you feel like you need to

118
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,430
batter yourself give yourself a

119
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,370
challenge a goal there the complete

120
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,770
right reasons oh by the way that was

121
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,139
that that photo I appreciate it looks

122
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,669
like it was only last week but but it

123
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:56,030
wasn't honestly it was it was quite some

124
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:58,639
time ago so again just there's me and a

125
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:01,219
lemur so as you can imagine pretty cool

126
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,080
that was it that was at the zoo so I

127
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,300
sort of worked my way up from from first

128
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,310
line support up to a head of IT at the

129
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,680
zoo and then I went over to Rack sermon

130
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,410
became a head of IT at Monte Penny then

131
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,680
I set up by myself a company called IT

132
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:17,780
transformed and then I started at the

133
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,479
football pools as the CTO on an interim

134
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,039
basis as part of my consultancy and then

135
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,960
actually ended up they they talked me

136
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:28,310
into joining the the exec board so I've

137
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,570
been there for about 18 months now and a

138
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,660
little bit more just to come back to the

139
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,580
bits I did before so I chair the the BCS

140
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,620
Chester in North Wales branch so it's a

141
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,948
really active group we do talks every

142
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,720
month we we regularly send out comms if

143
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:43,699
anybody wants to join or even come along

144
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,080
they're completely free you don't have

145
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:47,840
to be a member of the PCs to come along

146
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,960
free food free drink great speakers

147
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,929
really good topics just to say free food

148
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,739
again just just I'd really iterate that

149
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:59,389
and then I also I do some speaking and

150
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,159
mentoring I also look after the website

151
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:03,800
and number of other things for cyber

152
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:08,330
girls first what we do is we focus on

153
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:10,490
aged 14 to 18 girls who are looking at

154
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,948
getting into technology who sort of get

155
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,990
elbowed out by the by the boys that get

156
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:17,030
in their way we've still got a big

157
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,300
diversity problem in IT still need to

158
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,799
address it so recently I was very lucky

159
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,289
to be able to go to number 10 and talk

160
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,630
about it so that was one of my one of my

161
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:28,340
photos I try and wheel out and I've also

162
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,229
been doing safe and secure with is

163
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,479
c-squared for quite some time as well

164
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:34,370
Prairie about four years even before all

165
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,630
the Garfield stuff came along if anybody

166
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:40,460
else is a safe and secure volunteer so

167
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,990
now on to the actual the bit that's

168
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,700
really well hopefully important

169
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,070
but you'll be the judges of that so

170
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,630
quite a lot of these are naughty stuff

171
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,130
that everybody kind of knows but it's

172
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,320
nice to have a bit of a refresher every

173
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,180
once in a while it's good to be able to

174
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,820
just see it let's see it on paper sure

175
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,890
the slides will be available as well but

176
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,300
really it's about sort of the things

177
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,800
that I've gleaned over the years there

178
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,650
have actually been quite important to me

179
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,360
so I'll start rattling through them and

180
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:09,000
look this is the first one actually is

181
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,950
really quite important every single

182
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,980
company is a technology company these

183
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:15,599
days doesn't matter if you're in

184
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:19,230
manufacturing if you're in catering

185
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:22,530
building marketing obviously gaming

186
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:24,600
education everywhere uses technology so

187
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:27,150
if you can be an intrinsic part of that

188
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,610
technology then then you've got a career

189
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:31,409
for life now technology moves and adapts

190
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,120
and and being able to keep up with that

191
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,820
it's probably the most important part of

192
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,580
the role but the idea is that actually

193
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,860
as a person that is feeding in from all

194
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,990
levels making sure that technology is a

195
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,980
part of every business it means that

196
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:48,660
you'll be in a job for life so again

197
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,970
just to just to reiterate a lot of these

198
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,220
will be pretty simple things for most

199
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,050
people but you know be get to learn new

200
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,640
things you know bounce ideas off people

201
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,650
don't be scared to go and talk to people

202
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,300
and make sure that they know that you

203
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,250
know they can come to you and do the

204
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,640
same it's really important that

205
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:07,590
obviously this industry is so so helpful

206
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,409
and actually if you just go and ask

207
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,060
pretty much anyone even even rivals of

208
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,650
the company that you're you're working

209
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,730
for you'll probably find that they'll

210
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,690
come back to you and then actually be

211
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:20,280
really quite nice receptive and you know

212
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,650
recently started talking to some other

213
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,450
people in the gambling gambling arena

214
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,120
who actually I thought they're not going

215
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,890
to bother speaking to me I'm a rival and

216
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,180
actually they just opened up start chat

217
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,100
we had a really big open and frank

218
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,960
conversation which had a load of the

219
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,870
same problems and actually it was really

220
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,970
quite important for the both of us and

221
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,490
then you know again continuous learning

222
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:43,590
I was trying to think of that old odds

223
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,810
of a shark and it's standing still but I

224
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,130
couldn't remember it so and it was half

225
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,410
won when I finished these slides last

226
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,350
night so also bothered looking them up

227
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,510
but you know what I mean

228
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,250
so quite a lot of us actually forget

229
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,910
that that you and your brain is the

230
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,600
asset

231
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:02,040
so people don't implore you to go and do

232
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,050
the same thing as everything everybody

233
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,449
else actually that the most important

234
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,189
part of you is your brain and the way

235
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:11,280
you think and that's why you're in that

236
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:13,650
role so again people are starting to get

237
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,199
worried about you know automation taking

238
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,670
over jobs and things like that okay some

239
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,340
industries will be hurt more than others

240
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:22,229
but actually if you can find a way of

241
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,000
automating something that means that

242
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,100
then you are free to go and think about

243
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
something else to add value to so don't

244
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,420
forget that your brain is the part that

245
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,520
adds the value and and diversity is what

246
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:36,089
builds teams great teams you know if

247
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:38,400
you've got a you know a room of ten

248
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:40,890
people in a team who have got the same

249
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,930
past diversity is probably the biggest

250
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,850
biggest differentiator you can throw

251
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,050
into that mix you know bring somebody

252
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,910
else in bring somebody else that

253
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,439
challenges you that make sure they don't

254
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,150
just go along with everything you say

255
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,430
you want people to actually challenge

256
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:56,040
you it means you get the absolute best

257
00:09:53,430 --> 00:10:01,380
ideas don't be scared about diversity in

258
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:03,540
every team so look you guys know this

259
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,700
already you know I'm looking around lots

260
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,829
of people in the room that I know are

261
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,140
industry veterans you tinker every day

262
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,760
you go find resources but just for the

263
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,069
people that are looking at this as a as

264
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,630
a new career or just starting out you

265
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:20,130
know go and have a look

266
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:21,960
you know AWS do that you know there's

267
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:25,230
tons of free VMs that you can go and

268
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:27,960
play with just go and have a play a

269
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,270
tinker experiment you know just there's

270
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,250
plenty of words there but just go and

271
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:37,290
have a play it's the by far the best way

272
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:39,600
so this is one of the things that I get

273
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,069
quite frustrated by when I'm when I'm

274
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,170
working with teams is that they don't

275
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,090
they don't become self-sufficient you

276
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,160
can quite easily spoon feed people with

277
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,080
all of the answers but actually you know

278
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,719
what they're not the first person to

279
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,100
ever have this problem everybody else

280
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,230
with this problem would have been aware

281
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,080
as somewhere else and just being able to

282
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,400
use a search engine efficiently it's

283
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,260
probably one of the biggest things that

284
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,920
you can change which then people you

285
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:07,170
know give him an officious he's hungry

286
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,339
for it he's he's fat for a day teach

287
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,790
them how to use the search engine they

288
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:11,500
can Google stuff

289
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:16,089
that didn't work today but you know what

290
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:18,160
I mean so this one is particularly

291
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,590
pertinent in in the sort of the cyber

292
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,219
saccharina as well is that actually a

293
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:25,900
lot of people don't like people they

294
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,420
want to be able to sit in a corner be

295
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,280
left alone the like I even seen Sun and

296
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:35,890
somebody got nerds they're not like

297
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:37,959
people no I mean either way you know if

298
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,880
you slip into that typical techie type

299
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,920
of person where nobody wants to come and

300
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,980
speak to you you you're not approachable

301
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,300
you know you walk over to the

302
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,130
infrastructure guys and ask them for

303
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,050
something they just grunt and you know

304
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:52,240
you walk away it's not going to help

305
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,560
anybody so actually you've got to

306
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,660
remember first and foremost that

307
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,459
relationships are exactly why you're

308
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,990
there and that's why everybody else is

309
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,850
there everybody comes to work to do a

310
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,920
job but if you can actually communicate

311
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,630
with these people effectively and learn

312
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,069
to ask different types of questions and

313
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:11,070
lead people where you need them to go

314
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:11,070
you'll find actually that's a sorry gone

315
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:41,830
okay so so so yet the first the first

316
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,500
option was probably they'll want to go

317
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:46,120
down but actually to know what go and

318
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,290
sit and have a coffee with them take

319
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,630
them out for a coffee get them out of

320
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,579
there their safe area

321
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,830
arrange something where you can go and

322
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,510
have a have a chat explain what you

323
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,760
would like them to do I think is the

324
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,620
best success that I've had before and

325
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,590
also try and try and make them

326
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,660
understand on the impact of what they're

327
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:07,120
doing and actually none of this is

328
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,560
difficult stuff it again I suppose it

329
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,180
it's just about being able to have that

330
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,439
type of relationship where that where

331
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,260
you can be completely honest with them

332
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,090
but the best results I've found is like

333
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,770
I say taking them out for something to

334
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,870
eat or take them out for a coffee you

335
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,699
know pick somewhere where you can go and

336
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,030
sort of take yourself away from from

337
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,710
everybody else so

338
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,089
you need to do is to try and have that

339
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:28,580
conversation in front of other people in

340
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,930
your team because again that will just

341
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,480
especially if they're a senior manager

342
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:34,969
as well they you know I'm assuming this

343
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,800
senior manager will just go and go to

344
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,150
the person that they want and go and

345
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,670
tell them they need to go and do it now

346
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:45,470
and and and then they just need to go

347
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:47,300
and do it yeah I yeah look making them

348
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,940
understand the impact of it which is

349
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,510
difficult but but for me it's take them

350
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,340
out for coffee

351
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,689
make them understand the impact tell

352
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,610
them at actually that that other person

353
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,080
is going to work on other things and and

354
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,550
if you stop them from doing that they're

355
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,150
gonna have a detrimental impact on some

356
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:03,890
of the other bits as well it's it's

357
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,540
there's no there's no magic solution you

358
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,830
know it it suppose it's just about

359
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,079
building up that communication and

360
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,840
trying to get them to see why they're

361
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:15,230
being disruptive yeah

362
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,300
no magical solution unfortunately but

363
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,070
again I suppose coming back to the fact

364
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,260
that you you know if you go and network

365
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,750
like days like today's greats you can

366
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,620
network with people who are like-minded

367
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,420
and you can go and have a talk with

368
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,250
people and actually that should make

369
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,110
most people feel there feel pretty

370
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,610
comfortable but actually go and network

371
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:35,210
with people that are outside your peer

372
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:38,000
group as well so being a CTO go to a lot

373
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:39,910
of sort of CIO CTO events but actually I

374
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,170
quite enjoyed going to sort of business

375
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:44,510
events as well some marketing finance

376
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,800
actually it gives me a more experience

377
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:48,650
being able to network with people who

378
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:52,579
aren't necessarily within my direct peer

379
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:56,000
group so I think I've covered the the

380
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,200
Star Wars things here and so so who sort

381
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,130
of went through and read this in their

382
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:03,620
head as Yoda alright good good quite a

383
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,930
few excellent and I have been practicing

384
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,940
my Yoda voice however I I decided that

385
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,530
it wasn't good enough to be over to sit

386
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,020
down especially now it's on camera as

387
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,490
well so and but at the end of the day

388
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,250
yeah you don't learn anything from

389
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,110
success it's a fairly basic you know you

390
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,930
you learned that you've already know how

391
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,760
to do it so when you fail just you know

392
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,920
don't give up go grab some resources go

393
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:28,520
google it and go make sure actually that

394
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,959
you you go and understand the steps and

395
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,329
the troubleshooting steps that you took

396
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,760
to be able to go and actually fix it and

397
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,499
and again that bottom point there I

398
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,479
can't stress enough the

399
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:40,279
the fact that actually you need to be

400
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:43,759
willing to be able to hold up your hands

401
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:46,279
when you fail as a manager that's looked

402
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,359
and managed teams I can't stress how

403
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,399
important that is

404
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:51,769
so somebody come in to me and go look

405
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:53,449
I've really stuffed up here I need your

406
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:55,639
help holding your hands up and going

407
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:57,169
yeah I you know I need somebody to help

408
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,879
me I need I need to pull something out

409
00:15:57,169 --> 00:16:01,069
the bag I'm not going to hit the

410
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,989
deadlines just go and talk to people and

411
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:04,848
again just to reiterate always comes

412
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:08,709
back to the fact that communication with

413
00:16:04,849 --> 00:16:08,709
all your peers is so so important

414
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:14,269
question everything

415
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,829
so I've been annoying my family my

416
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:17,719
parents for quite some time probably

417
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:19,728
since I could talk that I literally

418
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:20,929
questioned everything but I suppose this

419
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,909
comes about some more the fact that

420
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:25,129
those steps that you take in you add is

421
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:26,629
that you know if you do the same thing

422
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:28,969
every day why are you doing the same

423
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:30,889
thing every day in the same way go find

424
00:16:28,969 --> 00:16:32,209
out how to automate it go and free up

425
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,789
your time to be able to do something

426
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:36,169
more efficient you add value because

427
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:38,299
you're doing something different

428
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:39,859
because you're thinking differently so

429
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:42,889
go and find a way of being able to go

430
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:44,659
and do it differently alter ate it and

431
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:46,189
then whilst you're doing it have a think

432
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:47,509
about how how somebody else like an

433
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:49,368
attacker could do it differently as well

434
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:50,720
actually it's really quite important to

435
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:52,129
be able to take you take your head out

436
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,809
of how you're doing it and how you've

437
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:55,249
been doing it for quite some time and

438
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:58,009
actually be able to just take a step

439
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:59,809
back you know go out and work for half a

440
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:02,059
day go to a coffee shop go and listen to

441
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:03,799
some conversations just remove yourself

442
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:06,678
from there and put yourself under a bit

443
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:08,299
of sort of mental stress and go and have

444
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:09,949
a think about how other people can do it

445
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:11,658
because that's generally where I find

446
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:16,220
out I come up with my best ideas either

447
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:17,839
that or the shower but either way so I

448
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,929
suppose just to cover a few of the the

449
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,279
basics off so if listening a bit of a

450
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:25,369
list there like say these slides will be

451
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:26,089
available but apprenticeships how I

452
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:28,879
started

453
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:30,710
I love apprenticeships there are you

454
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:32,209
know as we speak there are four or five

455
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,389
cybersecurity apprenticeships in

456
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:37,220
Liverpool so on that website you can

457
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:39,080
search for them have a look lots of

458
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,629
people are hiring you know cyber

459
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,189
security system admins all those sorts

460
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:47,149
of careers feed our careers into these

461
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:49,129
these pathways education again you know

462
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,360
quite a lot of people will come back to

463
00:17:49,129 --> 00:17:53,269
education if they don't

464
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:55,090
they're initially but you know again

465
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:57,440
great pathways into it

466
00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:00,049
volunteering something that's that's

467
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,510
close to me you know I love doing

468
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:03,918
volunteering I take holidays off work to

469
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,809
be able to go and do it I find it's

470
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,700
really important it also helps me have a

471
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:10,309
bit of a mental break and stops me

472
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,169
getting sort of burnout which again it's

473
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:14,450
really important to make sure that you

474
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:17,269
look after yourself as well although

475
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,919
saying that two years ago it was doing

476
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:21,019
triathlons running all the time I

477
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:22,789
started my new place I've literally

478
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:25,279
knocked up enhance a fitness put on

479
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:28,039
about four stone nearly so so you know

480
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,240
preacher and all that but um I've

481
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,620
concentrated obviously on my

482
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,070
volunteering more than my personal

483
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:35,268
fitness but I'll get it back eventually

484
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,590
as soon as the canteen stop doing

485
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:41,450
subsidized bacon sandwiches in the

486
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:43,580
morning so work experience so actually

487
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,830
there are loads of people in this

488
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,178
industry that will be happy to open the

489
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:50,928
doors and let you go in and do work

490
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:53,029
experience so actually when I when I

491
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:54,260
started my own company I I went and gave

492
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:56,059
somebody out there a call I won't

493
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,620
mention areas but I went gave them a

494
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:59,059
call I just said look I've not done

495
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,489
hands-on security for a couple of years

496
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:04,490
you mind if I rock up the doors were

497
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,919
open spent a week with them absolutely

498
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,809
loved it terrified me how much I'd lost

499
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:10,399
just in it in a couple of years actually

500
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:11,899
you know obviously things move on very

501
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,729
quickly and being in the management

502
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:16,639
scope tend not to pick it up as quickly

503
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:19,760
but really enjoyed it hopefully I was

504
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:22,668
helpful and not a pain in his ass but

505
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,559
again if you need experience this is

506
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:25,940
such a good community go pop it on

507
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,460
LinkedIn go and put it on any of the

508
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,799
forums people will find you experience

509
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:34,039
you know as long as you're ready and

510
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:36,649
willing people will find it industry

511
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:38,779
events like this blogs so actually

512
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:40,100
mentioned quite a few blogs there but

513
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:42,740
there's a few of my personal favorites

514
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,769
there Holly's actually over there as

515
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:47,389
well so she got a shout out podcasts

516
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:49,460
obviously you know how to mention our

517
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:52,699
our hosts journey there from human

518
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:55,070
factor smash in second and defense of

519
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,710
sec as well and there's a couple of

520
00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:00,500
really good Punk bug bounties don't take

521
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,299
a look at them go sign up actually even

522
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,799
if you're not going and actively doing

523
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:04,100
them there's great forums around it as

524
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:06,070
well

525
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,480
actually lots of people talk on their

526
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:12,620
which I suppose brings us to that bottom

527
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,840
one as well so just to reiterate this

528
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:19,520
industry is absolutely incredible and

529
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:21,740
actually everybody is super helpful by

530
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,139
the caveat obviously not everybody but

531
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:27,410
you'll find that some are slightly more

532
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,880
antisocial than others there's a social

533
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,370
engineer out there that was one for him

534
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,780
but he hasn't joined us hey her and but

535
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,850
you'll find that actually the first

536
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,649
thing to do is go find a mentor doesn't

537
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,600
matter where we're stage you are in your

538
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,669
career go find a mentor it's actually

539
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,129
really important I've got three or four

540
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:45,620
mentors at the moment who guide me when

541
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,690
I need help one of them is more of like

542
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,000
a coach which I go and have a day with

543
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:52,610
every every month but actually it's

544
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,110
really important to go find a mentor and

545
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,580
once you've got one go find another and

546
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,918
another and then once you're at that

547
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,860
stage don't be one it's actually really

548
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:04,720
important you find who in this room just

549
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:10,729
by show of hands has got a mentor okay

550
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:12,440
and who wants to find a mentor okay that

551
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,419
should be everybody honestly you can

552
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,669
never have too many mentors so just go

553
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:18,669
find one who's willing to be a mentor

554
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:25,520
I've got I've actually got a letter on

555
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:28,750
the next play but yeah so just just say

556
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,129
who is actually willing to be a mentor

557
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,409
right there's a load of people there if

558
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:35,179
you're looking to find one look at whose

559
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:36,799
hands are up and go and speak to them

560
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:38,960
honestly it's the best thing you'll do

561
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,780
go find some mentors and then be one

562
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,330
because literally anybody can learn

563
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:47,658
something from somebody else so just go

564
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:49,668
and go and do it already okay so how I

565
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:52,280
found my mentors was on Twitter and

566
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:54,890
LinkedIn all I did was I just appeal to

567
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,620
their ego right so that that's literally

568
00:21:54,890 --> 00:22:00,650
all I needed to do I said excuse me mr.

569
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:02,090
fantastic security person I've been

570
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,539
following your career for quite some

571
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,309
time

572
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:06,530
and I would love to have a coffee with

573
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:08,960
you and discuss it at some time you'd be

574
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:11,210
amazed how many people just go oh yeah

575
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,640
yeah no I'd absolutely love it because

576
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:14,840
they just feel like yeah actually most

577
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,999
people are in a position where they're

578
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,158
willing to be able to give advice

579
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:21,889
you know the main key points are play to

580
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:23,419
their ego right be flexible so say I can

581
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:25,609
do it over Skype what's up whatever

582
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:28,329
whatever works because I know your time

583
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:30,559
is really important yeah

584
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:32,359
understand what you're looking for out

585
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,918
of a mentor because actually if you can

586
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:35,299
give them some focus it'll be a lot

587
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,799
easier for them to be able to give you

588
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:38,719
advice because they generally only dip

589
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,209
in and out of conversations but you will

590
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:42,949
find it genuinely important to be able

591
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:44,359
to just say I'm looking for somebody to

592
00:22:42,949 --> 00:22:46,369
get to the next stage of my career I'm

593
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:48,168
looking for somebody to be able to you

594
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:50,869
know help me get into management looking

595
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:54,109
for somebody who can you know guide me

596
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:55,759
to what qualifications I need again keep

597
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:58,399
it keep it targeted and you'll find you

598
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,319
get more a lot more out of it and again

599
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:04,008
don't just pitch in pigeonhole yourself

600
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:06,379
I pin to CFO's I've been to CEOs one of

601
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:08,509
my one of my mentors at the moment is

602
00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:11,478
the the CEO of one of the largest sort

603
00:23:08,509 --> 00:23:13,129
of manufacturing companies just because

604
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:15,139
I'd seen him at industry events he

605
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:17,329
talked and actually it doesn't matter

606
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:18,438
who they are you know it matters what

607
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,658
they've done and that's what you're

608
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:24,469
asking them for so again make sure you

609
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:28,819
place their ego so dear awesome security

610
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:30,819

615
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:45,379

617
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:55,099
quick a quickie now if anybody sends one

618
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:58,339
of these on LinkedIn later more than

619
00:23:55,099 --> 00:24:00,319
happy to all right yeah could do a

620
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:11,359
response app yeah no I'm okay thanks

621
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:19,209
yeah okay any final questions but

622
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:19,208
hopefully you don't know yep

623
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:28,109
you know let you know

624
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:30,329
to be able to do that you know I'm

625
00:24:28,109 --> 00:24:32,639
really laughing because you know if I'd

626
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:35,579
been the 18 the 18 year old me and I'd

627
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:37,408
probably just watch this I probably

628
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:38,789
wouldn't have listened to most of it but

629
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:41,339
you know what only takes one or two

630
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:42,929
little things I think probably the best

631
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:44,668
advice I could give to those is that

632
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:47,159
become their mentor whether they want to

633
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:50,159
or not so what I've found that actually

634
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:51,869
is that you know caveat the sentence

635
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,079
with I know you might not want to hear

636
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:57,448
this but actually quite a lot of the

637
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:59,459
time even though they may not want the

638
00:24:57,449 --> 00:25:01,799
advice sometimes if you can give a

639
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:04,409
little bit of advice without being

640
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,999
forceful with it it'll sink in so I

641
00:25:04,409 --> 00:25:08,039
think that you know the main thing is

642
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:09,899
just make sure they know that you're

643
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,579
there if you ever need them and that

644
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:14,069
they can trust you to come and talk and

645
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:15,809
and I think that you know they will come

646
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:18,949
and talk to you eventually if they need

647
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:22,109
it but yeah informal bits of steering I

648
00:25:18,949 --> 00:25:24,419
tend to find and and certainly things

649
00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:26,218
like in meetings where you can see that

650
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:27,899
they're being either either pushed out

651
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:28,729
or they're they're not being included

652
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:31,559
they're not being asked for opinions

653
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:33,239
