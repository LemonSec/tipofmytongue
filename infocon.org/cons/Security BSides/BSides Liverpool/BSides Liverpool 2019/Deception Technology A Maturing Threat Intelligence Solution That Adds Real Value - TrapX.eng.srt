1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:09,370
that's better there you go hello listen

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:13,210
I'm Shaun Lord I work for a firm called

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:17,490
tropics an israeli-american deception

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:19,750
technology company and I thought I would

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,198
dispense with any sort of product

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:26,920
placement or any promotion of my firm

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,510
and talk about deception technology so

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,189
that's the purpose of this talk today to

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,019
be able to give you a better

10
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:34,269
understanding of what deception tech

11
00:00:32,019 --> 00:00:39,670
actually does what it means and what its

12
00:00:34,269 --> 00:00:43,079
implications are so one starts with the

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:47,020
premise that deception is being applied

14
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:50,500
certainly in warfare from thousands of

15
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,719
years ago and the idea that to deceive

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,699
one's enemy in order to be able to win a

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,399
battle without fighting the battle is

18
00:00:54,699 --> 00:01:00,730
the ultimate definition of war success

19
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:04,570
was founded by since you in the art of

20
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:06,399
war of course we used it this is an

21
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,830
illustration of how the British and the

22
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:13,000
Americans just before d-day were able to

23
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:16,929
establish fake armies of course Patton

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,600
was believed to be mounting an attack I

25
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,150
believe on share book and by the use of

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,399
fake assets which is an illustrate this

27
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:27,310
is what this is trying to do by the use

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,159
of fake assets they convinced German

29
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,630
reconnaissance that that that their

30
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,280
intended target

31
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:37,030
would they misled them on what the

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,640
intended target was okay so let's get

33
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,259
into it I scraped quite a bit of

34
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,329
information from what Gartner have been

35
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:45,970
saying Garneau have decided that this

36
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:47,770
particular sector is of keen interest to

37
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:52,240
them they've released four separate

38
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:54,640
reports in 2019 and I take a lot of

39
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,259
their definitions is a definition up on

40
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,270
the screen I always work on the

41
00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:00,399
principle that any person presenting

42
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,340
that reads from the screen is not doing

43
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,619
the audience any favors so if I can I'm

44
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,160
just going to summarize that briefly

45
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:12,610
what deception technology really means

46
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,819
so deception technology is when an

47
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:19,660
entity the legitimate entity establishes

48
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:23,260
a shadow network on which fake assets

49
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,329
are placed with there being no

50
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,769
legitimate reason for those of fake

51
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,620
assets to be touched

52
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:32,230
hacker comes into the network or is

53
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,569
already there and then performs a

54
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,549
scanning ie a lateral movement and it is

55
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:39,730
that through the lateral movement that

56
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:42,340
they will touch one of these fake

57
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,500
emulations which leads to an alert

58
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:48,400
actually what it leads to is a very high

59
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:51,430
fidelity alert so the premises is that

60
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,489
by establishing fake legitimate or

61
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:58,720
rather highly authentic fake assets on a

62
00:02:54,489 --> 00:03:00,959
network if said asset is touched there's

63
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,690
no legitimate reason to do that and that

64
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,489
considerably helps the sock teams in

65
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,190
order to be able to identify which

66
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:11,530
alerts that they should look for so I

67
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,810
have another slide later and I'm getting

68
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,000
ahead of myself but what it really is is

69
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,810
what garner described it as is a low

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,340
friction high fidelity alert system and

71
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:25,750
that's really what deception is all

72
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:28,260
about so I'm going to now look into some

73
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,879
more detail about what a multi-layered

74
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,010
deception strategy or deployment

75
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,489
strategy might look like this is generic

76
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,500
it's not explicit to us at all okay so

77
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:40,420
here in a nutshell is what an

78
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,599
architecture looks like when one is

79
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,849
deploying a deception network and you

80
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,339
see that there are inherently four

81
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:51,579
component parts of a deception strategy

82
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,400
at the top you'll see in fact a pointer

83
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,200
Vega at the top you will see that there

84
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,409
is a management console this could be a

85
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,518
virtual or it could be hardware based

86
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:03,670
particularly relevant for example when

87
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:06,580
one has we have a number of one of our

88
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:09,609
largest customers is Unilever and they

89
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,080
have the 300 factories globally so if

90
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,819
you need to be able to protect a

91
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,319
particular location you can either

92
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:18,620
centralize it in the cloud environment

93
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,930
or you can place a hardware

94
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:24,979
management console on-site in order to

95
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:26,840
be able to aggregate the data secondly

96
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:30,409
you'll see these different types are

97
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,448
sensitive assets so we'll start with

98
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,820
deception tokens Wilshire I'm gonna show

99
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:37,160
you in a few moments how these are

100
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,380
deployed and what they use for emulated

101
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,800
traps which is the foundation so that

102
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:47,060
the spine of deception is the creation

103
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,130
of traps and so there's probably quite a

104
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,300
few people in this room that are

105
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,639
reflecting on what is the difference

106
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,610
between deception tech and honey pots

107
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,010
and the fundamental difference is the

108
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,740
degree of sophistication of the trap

109
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,750
itself and that's what we're looking

110
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,820
towards when we look at an emulated trap

111
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,130
so these emulated traps could be and

112
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,710
these different use cases could be for

113
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:13,330
example an intellectual property lawyer

114
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:16,039
has particular assets written and other

115
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,020
patents and other that it wants to

116
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,510
protect that could be one of the

117
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,010
individual traps deployed manufacturing

118
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,650
firm could have particularly scarred or

119
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:26,900
related emulations that they wish to

120
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:29,570
create and a hospital could have for

121
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,090
example MRI scanners that or IOT devices

122
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:35,630
that they want to create so it really is

123
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:38,119
customer dependent what type of trap you

124
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:40,190
create and to the more mature the vendor

125
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,440
the wider the range of individual dip or

126
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,840
air trap deployment options that you

127
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,300
have and lastly in the the highest

128
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,638
degree of sophistication is to be able

129
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:54,380
to provide a full operating system trap

130
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:58,460
so it will literally work with it will

131
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:02,000
respond back to queries from the hacker

132
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:05,090
and in order to be able to maintain its

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,979
supposedly Dismas II and this is another

134
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,900
advantage of deception in as much as

135
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:10,789
traditionally when you are on a network

136
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,620
and you are protecting the network you

137
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:14,389
see malicious activity you want to keep

138
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,070
them off as soon as possible you can't

139
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:17,180
afford to wait you can't afford to

140
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,880
linger you have to get rid of them as

141
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,820
soon as possible but on a deception a

142
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,500
fake network or shadow network you can

143
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,150
let them linger because it's not

144
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,520
actually touching any of your critical

145
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,460
assets and the advantage of that is is

146
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,799
that you learn more about

147
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,169
their mo about that particular what is

148
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,520
what their particular objectives are and

149
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:41,170
and as such you can build you can one

150
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,940
acquire better threat intelligence and

151
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:45,970
two you can make it a more effective

152
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,530
response so as a generic architecture

153
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,390
these are the component parts of what a

154
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:52,150
deception technology solution would look

155
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:55,150
like you'll see how they communicate via

156
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:58,150
proxy to the full OS and the deception

157
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:01,419
tokens are essentially breadcrumbs and

158
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:06,400
they lure a particular malicious actor

159
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:07,990
into to touch the trap okay so let's

160
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,450
have a look at what what that actually

161
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:14,710
means this is the the workflow of a

162
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:17,650
malicious activity and you see obviously

163
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:20,229
that this is the the reconnaissance

164
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:22,450
stage this is quite interesting we had I

165
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,920
don't mean this to be some sort of

166
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,140
product placement or push but it's quite

167
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,930
interesting how certain firms have been

168
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:30,789
able to see for example large

169
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,860
manufacturing company said they were

170
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:35,380
able to identify a ransomware attack

171
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,720
using deception at the reconnaissance

172
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,700
stage which was literally one week

173
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,070
before the actual attack took place

174
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,289
so they described it as they were able

175
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:46,440
to identify a malicious actor one week

176
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:48,940
before the actual attack took place

177
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,210
so the fundamental premise with

178
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:56,170
deception is that it really it it relies

179
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:58,659
upon or /it it uses a cat performing

180
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:00,790
lateral movement across a network and in

181
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:04,810
that lateral movement they will interact

182
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:06,280
with a trap and the last one is the

183
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,080
hacker will see that they have the

184
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,330
ability they will have an object if they

185
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,250
will look for high-value targets and

186
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:15,070
I've given these illustrations of

187
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:17,020
intellectual property as scarred relate

188
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:19,840
it could be mission-critical from an apt

189
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,609
or malicious nation-state perspective

190
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,739
they will have particular targets in

191
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,350
mind that they will be aiming for and

192
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,990
then one goes into this idea about how

193
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:31,050
long can deploy a deception strategy so

194
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,430
you could for example you could

195
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,769
ring-fence the crown jewels with

196
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,838
deceptive

197
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:39,058
traps in order to be able to protect the

198
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,349
crown jewels that could be one so there

199
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:46,019
are many ways that you can actually

200
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:49,069
respond according to this workflow so

201
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:52,559
let's have a look about how you match

202
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:55,290
activity against a deployment strategy

203
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,868
so at the reconnaissance stage you will

204
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:01,949
in attempt to be able to entice them in

205
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:03,839
again using these lures as bait in order

206
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:06,420
to be able to entice them in I come back

207
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,069
to this point because interestingly it's

208
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:12,689
been highlighted that within this space

209
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:15,299
essentially there are some lures that

210
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:16,860
can be identified and but the basic

211
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:18,989
principle is is that if you can identify

212
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,029
a form of deception it ain't deception

213
00:09:18,989 --> 00:09:23,489
anymore

214
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:25,799
it relies upon natural movements can

215
00:09:23,489 --> 00:09:27,449
lead to early breach detection this

216
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:30,629
comes back to this idea of high fidelity

217
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:32,699
alert it's sometimes it's almost too

218
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:34,709
high fidelity in as much as we had one

219
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:37,139
very large manufacturing firm called up

220
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:39,420
our CEO and said you are the only firm

221
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:41,100
that is generating an alert none of our

222
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,459
other solutions are generating alert why

223
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,679
is that

224
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:45,059
is this a false positive because Mac has

225
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,730
checked and says no it's a legitimate

226
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:51,990
it's a legitimate alert and it turned

227
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:54,240
out that a pen tester had briefly less

228
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,279
than a second touched one of the

229
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,519
individual traps and then left the whole

230
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:01,649
network and none of the other solutions

231
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,529
actually picked this up except deception

232
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:06,990
tech so deception has its role but

233
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:10,949
explicitly when the the buying

234
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:12,480
organization can extract the value I'll

235
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:14,790
go into that and maybe that's a

236
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,259
commercial statement but it's as ever

237
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,990
with security solutions is the

238
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:20,939
extraction of value that leads to an

239
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:23,449
organization getting the most out of it

240
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:25,949
and being able to secure the budget and

241
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:28,679
the ability to be able to actively

242
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:32,669
engage for example with a ransomware

243
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:34,470
attack my vendor but also multiple and

244
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:38,009
doesn't have the ability to be able to

245
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:41,189
offer up assets for encryption which

246
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:43,319
itself will the ransomware will consume

247
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:44,389
those assets delaying moving on to

248
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:46,459
legitimate

249
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:47,959
giving the sock team's time in order to

250
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:53,748
be able to respond to the ransomware

251
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:56,329
attack so you'll see here as I've

252
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:58,039
previously mentioned we have what to use

253
00:10:56,329 --> 00:11:00,289
so at the reconnaissance stage we're

254
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:01,699
using bait squeeze in breadcrumbs at the

255
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:05,659
lateral movement stages we're using

256
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:07,819
these traps and at the identification

257
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:09,859
the value target we're actively engaging

258
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:13,219
them for example with the real OS here

259
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:15,139
which leads to the ability to be able to

260
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:19,149
as mentioned generate high fidelity

261
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:22,099
alerts so what is effective what does

262
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:23,720
deception tech mean to be effective well

263
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:27,619
first of all it has to be non intrusive

264
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,779
in as much as the idea for example it's

265
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:31,939
it's best used therefore when it's

266
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:34,489
protecting assets that you can't touch

267
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:38,509
as we mentioned Scott advices medical

268
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:40,729
devices another it should have from the

269
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:43,399
trap perspective he should be able to

270
00:11:40,729 --> 00:11:46,279
support a variety of both virtual and

271
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:49,519
physical devices and and to be able to

272
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:51,709
be deployed at scale you see here we've

273
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,589
gone through it is particularly

274
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:57,799
interesting and useful from an OT IOT

275
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:59,269
perspective highly realistic to be able

276
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:02,089
to avoid fingerprinting we'll come back

277
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:04,939
to that and the ability to be able to

278
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:06,799
actively engage with the malicious act

279
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:09,909
or in order to be able to generate as

280
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:12,439
much information as possible

281
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:16,029
here's how it looks this is my only

282
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:20,509
slide dimensions how we're brilliant but

283
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:22,339
you'll see it's a repetition of what we

284
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:23,809
already mentioned has nothing to do with

285
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:25,249
my nerves that I'm going from one

286
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:29,029
particular point to another nothing at

287
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:31,069
all and you'll see here on the side so

288
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:33,169
we've got again its basic principle the

289
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:36,378
idea is essentially that deception

290
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:40,220
technology is fundamentally non complex

291
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:42,019
and personally as a person that's been

292
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:45,470
promoting cyber products for quite a few

293
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:48,199
years I am delighted that it is non

294
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:51,049
complex that people can grasp it very

295
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:53,868
quickly so we have all of these

296
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:55,608
different traps and if one's evaluating

297
00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:57,140
a deception vendor one should look at

298
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:59,720
the range of different

299
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:04,160
traps emulations tools that are

300
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:06,079
available for example my thumb has the

301
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,110
ability offers the customer the ability

302
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,819
to be able to build your own trap which

303
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,589
is particularly significant if for

304
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,500
example you're in oil and gas and you're

305
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:18,140
saying to me I have a custom workflow

306
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,970
that touches scarda related

307
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:23,449
infrastructure that nobody else is using

308
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:26,510
and I need you to emulate to copy that

309
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:29,000
we can do it so the ability to be able

310
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:32,540
to customize and create your own traps

311
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,120
is a definite asset but takes a relative

312
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:38,209
degree of security maturity I'll come to

313
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,459
that in a moment actually here's how it

314
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:41,719
looks so you'll see at the

315
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:44,540
reconnaissance stage we're using

316
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,589
endpoint tokens active directory tokens

317
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,529
and such

318
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:50,990
these laws all come down into the

319
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:53,329
ability for example to be able to again

320
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:56,570
this these would be emulations to be

321
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:57,859
able to touch VoIP or printers or those

322
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,779
particular assets that you would

323
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,089
recognize run the network but are

324
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:06,079
vulnerable together with medical devices

325
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:08,269
scarred a point of sale and other here

326
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,089
we have again the ability to be able to

327
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:14,120
identify high-value targets using these

328
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:18,740
particular assets it's quite interesting

329
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:21,610
for example that one lure might be an

330
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,660
Active Directory server that has

331
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,040
administration credentials from an

332
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,810
individual that is no longer with the

333
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,990
company but the credentials is still

334
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:33,729
live so that would be a law to bring in

335
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:40,100
a malicious actor in order to be able to

336
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:43,160
activate a trap so this is an

337
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,459
illustration of generic malware as it

338
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,029
were

339
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:50,420
so using an SMB token we are it's able

340
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:54,019
to be able to attack to lure in and to

341
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:58,519
be identified as an alert as malicious

342
00:14:54,019 --> 00:15:00,320
activity depending again upon one's

343
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,060
deployment strategy there's no

344
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,470
commercial difference

345
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,939
certainly within my firm and I think

346
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,670
generically there's no commercial

347
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:12,420
difference between deploying

348
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:15,180
20 traps and 400 and you you are

349
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:17,790
therefore as an architect free to be

350
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:20,279
able to deploy as many as you see fit as

351
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:23,639
you see is appropriate in order to be

352
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:25,709
able to protect your assets so this is

353
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,079
exactly what you do using proxy have the

354
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:34,170
ability to be able to again protect the

355
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:36,540
high value target and going further from

356
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:39,829
an ad from an advanced persistent threat

357
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:43,769
perspective again this is where

358
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:45,810
deception technology comes into play we

359
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:48,209
as an organization we're on these sort

360
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,160
of geopolitical fault lines between

361
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:52,859
certain nation-states where quite

362
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,130
frankly the weaker one wants a degree of

363
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,449
protection against the stronger four for

364
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:00,510
example it's critical infrastructure

365
00:15:57,449 --> 00:16:01,800
assets and we're doing this so at a

366
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:05,339
number of different flash points

367
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:08,339
globally we are deployed by the weaker

368
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:10,139
nation states to protect their critical

369
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:14,279
infrastructure because this is a

370
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:17,269
cost-effective resource effective

371
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:19,350
solution so I'll just come to that

372
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:22,320
Procter & Gamble another one of our

373
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:24,899
customers talked about what the explicit

374
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,060
value they gain from deploying deception

375
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:29,699
and they mentioned two things the first

376
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,790
thing is is that they mentioned the fact

377
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:35,699
that because it's a high fidelity alert

378
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:38,130
the amount of analyst time required in

379
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:39,479
order to be able to go from a situation

380
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,360
where you believe that there is an alert

381
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,070
to you have analyzed it and you

382
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,620
responded is dramatically shortened

383
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,810
because you know it to be high fidelity

384
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:52,079
and there are a few of them so you're

385
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:54,660
not getting this seam flood few alerts

386
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,729
of high fidelity the second thing is and

387
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,430
this might appeal to individuals that

388
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:02,190
are working in socks and such is that

389
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,989
they went from a 12-hour day where there

390
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:07,020
had to be constantly physically

391
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:08,640
monitoring to an eight-hour day because

392
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,220
they literally gained sufficient

393
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,809
confidence in what these alerts were

394
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,400
providing them sufficient that they

395
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:17,069
could just literally respond to set

396
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,439
alerts so the explicit values of

397
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,849
deploying deception are that you can

398
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,380
literally produce

399
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:24,809
the amount of analytical time required

400
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,569
by a sock team and you can therefore

401
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:30,120
reduce the number of working hours in a

402
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:33,720
day for this team hopefully leading to

403
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:35,570
more efficient retention of staff so

404
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:41,460
can't have a number of individual

405
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:43,559
comments to make about this this was

406
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:47,150
I've just scraped this from a slide that

407
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:50,149
an analyst gave her to her Gartner SEC

408
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:52,710
USA Maryland I believe just last week

409
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,240
what the analyst was attempting to be

410
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,179
able to do is to illustrate that

411
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,010
deception can be deployed on varying

412
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:01,080
degrees of different firms depending

413
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:03,450
upon what your particular need is and we

414
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,549
in our organization I have active

415
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:10,650
customers that are varying degrees of

416
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:13,549
team size for example on this particular

417
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:17,220
side I have a group of team they run

418
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:20,789
they run 160 they manage and run 160

419
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:23,549
ship's globally and they have one

420
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:25,470
centralized security team but it's more

421
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:28,020
like an IT team than a cert than a sock

422
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,720
and they rely upon deception technology

423
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,740
around their particular infrastructure

424
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,200
explicitly to give them a legitimate

425
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,000
alert so they don't have a shock they

426
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:42,450
trust the alerts they respond to the

427
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:44,220
alerts there is where everyone takes the

428
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,500
alert there has to be a degree of

429
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,770
analysis and by implication there has to

430
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,450
be a degree of security maturity in

431
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,908
order to be able to extract the most

432
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,919
value from the solution so this leads

433
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:59,309
actually to the next four he described

434
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,770
it as the lean forward Enterprise which

435
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:03,809
in my mind is just progressive rear to

436
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,429
be proactive rather than reactive it

437
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:08,879
sounds like a a new phrase against it

438
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:10,980
but so we have organizations that have

439
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,559
globally follow-the-sun centralized

440
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:16,740
socks that have deception feeding into

441
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:18,960
them through to one individual sock

442
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:22,500
limited number of staff limited number

443
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:25,370
of man hours in the day to organizations

444
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,370
that don't even have a sock

445
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:31,970
gained a particular so I think what

446
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:34,940
Gartner actually trying to say in in and

447
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:38,240
paraphrase is that the the sector has

448
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:41,150
matured to the point of which it should

449
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,820
be seriously considered by organizations

450
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,950
and that's certainly what we're seeing

451
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:50,000
for example there have been since the

452
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:52,220
Bangladeshi bank Swift hack there have

453
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,590
been first of all Swift as a an

454
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:56,780
organization have encouraged banks to be

455
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,820
able to think out of the box and

456
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,520
secondly a number of these institutions

457
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,710
have literally deployed Swift emulations

458
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,190
on their networks so we just deployed

459
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,929
one

460
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:08,420
we're actively going through it now

461
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:11,360
actually for a European bank that is

462
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:13,730
explicitly deploying Swift emulations so

463
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,370
they see again this is the the wide

464
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:21,470
range of individual types of traps that

465
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:23,360
you can deploy that is a value how'd you

466
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,730
get the budget so I've got two slides

467
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,760
basically to be able to illustrate use

468
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:36,080
cases that security professionals can

469
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:38,960
quote in their budgetary requests hmm so

470
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,460
I mean in fact I'm just gonna put these

471
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,290
two slides up rather than go into great

472
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,980
detail because I appreciate one you can

473
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:48,110
read it and to use cases how interesting

474
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,420
are they but it's an illustration of

475
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:52,790
again how mature this comes explicitly

476
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:55,220
from a specific Gartner report if you

477
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:57,200
would like the full range of use cases

478
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:00,670
just give me a shout my emails at the

479
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:05,300
end and I'm happy to share them with you

480
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:08,600
an obligatory scary use case security

481
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,409
presentation without one with it ok so

482
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,439
there's an article in The Washington

483
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:15,050
Post that basically stated about how

484
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,710
malware was infected on to an MRI scan

485
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:22,460
sufficient that cancerous nodes were

486
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:25,540
either placed on to a patient's records

487
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:29,809
or removed from a patient's records and

488
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:32,770
the radiographers the cardiology team

489
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:36,649
were unable to differentiate between

490
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:39,260
malware displayed by cancerous nodes and

491
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,910
legitimate then the Washington Post

492
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,350
article went a step further and it

493
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:45,260
suggested that if there was a

494
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:48,790
presidential election in XYZ country and

495
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:52,670
said presidential nominee received a

496
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:55,100
stage four cancer diagnosis from his

497
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:57,770
trusted medical adviser that individual

498
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,870
may not participate in the presidential

499
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,670
election they may back off think he was

500
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:03,399
there final days figure homeless in a

501
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:07,730
rocking chair

502
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:11,350
the challenge is is that the radiography

503
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:15,710
team could not identify malware infused

504
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:18,770
imagery so definitely MRI scanning

505
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:21,800
medical devices are open to both fake

506
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:25,370
news and very significant impact against

507
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:27,649
individuals so here's an illustration as

508
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:30,199
it relates to a medical environment this

509
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:32,210
is explicitly as it relates to an MRI

510
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,670
scanner so there's the network we

511
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:37,070
actually did quite a bit of research

512
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:39,950
there's it's a free to download off our

513
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:41,360
site a report that it's called the

514
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:44,170
measure report that basically

515
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,550
illustrates we set up a network a

516
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:49,130
complete network effect of fake hospital

517
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:51,260
with this network to see what type of

518
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:55,190
malware would attempt to be able to

519
00:22:51,260 --> 00:23:00,020
penetrate it to be able to see exactly

520
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:02,390
how what their MOS were in the search so

521
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:06,530
it was injected within the MRI system an

522
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:08,929
old operating system you'll see here

523
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:12,710
that it explicitly targeted the PAC

524
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:14,650
system this is significant from a from a

525
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:18,610
medical infrastructure perspective

526
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:21,740
because that is the the the point where

527
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:24,909
both the information coming in and the

528
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:29,840
ability to react upon it are combined

529
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:33,200
and as you can imagine their particular

530
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,870
Romo wistar target older software in

531
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,100
order to be able to make the most impact

532
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:41,689
least likely to be patched etc etc so

533
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,209
this basically follows the same tenants

534
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:46,310
that one is either seeing in our own

535
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,049
hospitals and globally was we're seeing

536
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:51,158
this

537
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:54,429
pretty much continuously wear devices

538
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:56,409
MRI IOT another are being explicitly

539
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:57,759
targeted I've given earlier an

540
00:23:56,409 --> 00:24:00,249
illustration about how that could be

541
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:02,289
malicious but of course the individual

542
00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:06,600
ransomware attacks that were impacting

543
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:09,549
the NHS are another illustration of that

544
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,230
so this is quite interesting so Gartner

545
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:13,539
gonnigan I keep talking about them but

546
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:16,200
one of the things they did they did this

547
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:19,179
test of all of the different vendors and

548
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:23,200
they asked us to do a particular number

549
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:24,639
of network admin related exposes and we

550
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,889
asked why and they said well because

551
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:29,559
when we went through the same task with

552
00:24:26,889 --> 00:24:32,709
other vendors we were literally able to

553
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:34,269
identify the laws on the network which

554
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:36,340
is quite interesting because if you can

555
00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:36,940
identify a law if you can identify a

556
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,100
deception

557
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:42,580
it ain't deception no more so this is

558
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:46,119
the tool that they used and this is the

559
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:48,369
comment they made in true sales fashion

560
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:51,549
of course my firm did not suffer from

561
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:52,658
this particular discrepancy but what

562
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:56,230
does that mean I think that means that

563
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:59,049
gives us a six-month window but you'll

564
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:01,539
see that the tools on either side are

565
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:03,340
developing and one is attempting to go

566
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:05,679
further ahead but it is certainly still

567
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:13,408
significant as it relates to the

568
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:13,409
deception cool on time how about that

569
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:21,549
just to let you know we have a stand out

570
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:23,259
in the foyer if you'd like some further

571
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:25,299
information and if some people have been

572
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:29,139
asking career advice another please grab

573
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:30,190
my email and welcome to share later any

574
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:33,059
questions at this point

575
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,059
all yes sir

576
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:00,640
so I would answer by saying that there

577
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:03,370
should be no legitimate reason to be

578
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,010
able to trip the network so for example

579
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:08,469
if it's a shadow network then legitimate

580
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:11,440
patcher of MRI scans would be only

581
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:22,930
working on the legitimate network and

582
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:26,350
not on the shadow network yes no in as

583
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:28,900
much as one can also deploy dynamic with

584
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:31,149
the trap deployment which means that

585
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:53,380
that individual list is constantly

586
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:55,180
changing so yes yes no I think that you

587
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,820
would just open that up and allow that

588
00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:01,240
illegitimate patch here to be able to

589
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:02,889
interact with the traps in such a way

590
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,630
that you would recognize that an alert

591
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:06,700
generated there you would examine it but

592
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:08,950
at the same time you would allow it you

593
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,420
would know you wouldn't wipe the stip

594
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:19,630
because of course that could be another

595
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:22,590
route in for example cool I'll get off

596
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,590
the stage thank you very much
