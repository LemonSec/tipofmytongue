1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,330
good how are we be okay enjoying it

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:13,230
yep how many Scouts is in the room oh

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:16,059
good oh shit

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,240
that's room four of my jokes already to

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:21,220
be quite honest so listen it is an

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,320
absolute honor I'm going to jump down

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,090
here because I keep walking in front of

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,680
that it's an absolute honor to be asked

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:32,259
or to be selected to give a talk as you

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,910
may guess oh gosh as you may guess I'm

11
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,559
from Liverpool and from Walt Walton

12
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,569
originally no not the prison thank you

13
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:42,180
very much about three miles down here

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:44,890
and it is a joy to see a tech

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,079
environment growing up throughout

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,780
Liverpool because when I was a kid

17
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,059
growing up through the 80s the closest I

18
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,770
got to technology was somebody chipping

19
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:55,780
your digital signal so you could get

20
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,410
free sky or free boy band or something

21
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:01,480
like that to see it as a cyber security

22
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,608
discipline and to see people working in

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,830
it and it's starting to thrive is an

24
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:07,689
absolute joy I unfortunately left when I

25
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:12,009
was about 21 it's about six seven years

26
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:13,600
ago and I I now live in bath and but

27
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,909
it's great to come back home it's still

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,539
home for me just before we go any

29
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:23,670
further there blues blues anyone know

30
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,670
Reds yes

31
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,299
ramier yep me and Kenny irons went to

32
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:30,548
school sameen Kenny Owens played in the

33
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:32,890
same school team which takes me on to my

34
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:37,689
next slide it's almost like we waited it

35
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:40,900
almost like we were two so a little bit

36
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:42,339
about me and two slides to talk about my

37
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:46,210
background a little bit I've been in

38
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,860
security about 25 years although I

39
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:51,520
wanted to be a professional footballer

40
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:54,430
like everybody in Liverpool that's me in

41
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,429
the blue that's me in the blue playing

42
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:59,200
at Wembley back in 2000 in the FA vars

43
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:03,640
final got beat one nil cried like a big

44
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:06,399
girl so like gas going and on the other

45
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,470
side of the screen that is me with not

46
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,420
two of the seven dwarfs with Anton deck

47
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:14,960
on a

48
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:17,720
a it wasn't even a quiz show was it was

49
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,510
a game of look red or black it was and

50
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,340
essentially you got to the end and if

51
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,170
you were the last person standing you

52
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:29,810
had a red or black decision for a

53
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:30,799
million-pound guess which I chose yeah

54
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,380
cuz I'd have been here if I had a

55
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,600
million quid right no I would have been

56
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:39,170
it's great to it it is great to come

57
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:43,459
back home and what this talk is about is

58
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:46,309
the idea that vendors keep telling us

59
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:48,800
that the more logs we collect the more

60
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,360
information we collect there's got to be

61
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,000
something in there for us

62
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,280
it's I understand that that is a use

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,019
case for logs and log collection right

64
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,780
I'm not saying we can't do what I'm

65
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:01,459
gonna talk about without it what I am

66
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,170
saying though is that a lot of vendors

67
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:05,030
and a lot of their hype and a lot of

68
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,119
what they tell you and they talk about

69
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:11,470
data like this and lock collection that

70
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,930
and correlation the other is largely

71
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,350
bullshit now I will swear from time to

72
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,880
time

73
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,470
unfortunately I'm sorry about that if

74
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,840
you are offended by it you've got about

75
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,370
20 minutes or so left of it and then you

76
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,959
can get on with your day after that it's

77
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:28,610
it's really you know I'm slightly

78
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:32,930
inoffensive I think so just to describe

79
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:36,440
and frame the issue and you've probably

80
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:38,810
heard Ms ESPYs trotted out all the time

81
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,209
what I want to try and dispel is this

82
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:45,320
needle-in-a-haystack nonsense because it

83
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:47,120
is nonsense when today's attackers come

84
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,780
into your network they are hiding in

85
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,250
plain sight they're hiding in the noise

86
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,660
so when you're looking for a needle in a

87
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,360
haystack you're actually looking for

88
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,180
another bit hey it's it's more hay

89
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,299
amongst hay and how do you spot that and

90
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:05,000
how do you accurately and and sensibly

91
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:07,070
use your time in your resources to get

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,030
to the hay so that's what I'm going to

93
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:13,670
be focused on this is almost akin to the

94
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,739
old adage the old story coming which is

95
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:18,858
killing tanti gorya and the old adage

96
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:20,840
the old story of the girl who wakes up

97
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,820
in the morning goes into the room

98
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,888
there's a whole room full of horseshit

99
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,240
she wants a pony for a birthday

100
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,939
and she's digging through the whole shit

101
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,469
with the out with the with the mentality

102
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:32,539
that there's gotta be a pony in here

103
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:36,169
somewhere with this mature shit it's the

104
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:40,610
same type of approach right - two months

105
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:43,748
- too much Waylon not enough no okay

106
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:47,330
not enough okay well you asked for it

107
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:49,909
let me make sure so so some of some of

108
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,919
the whys why is it difficult and one of

109
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:53,779
the big ones is is a layer fatigue the

110
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,180
noise becomes the threat when you

111
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:58,789
collect every log that is available to

112
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,469
collect and Splunk would love you to

113
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:03,110
collect every single log that is

114
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:04,879
available to collect and the noise

115
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,550
becomes the threat the attackers know

116
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,229
this we know this in the advanced

117
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,599
detection the advanced threat detection

118
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:14,180
side of things and they quite happily

119
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:18,919
hide in that noise a layer fatigue is a

120
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:21,050
common problem and with detective

121
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:23,479
controls that we still focus on

122
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,909
prevention with detective controls and

123
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:27,620
then all prevention is better than cure

124
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:30,289
but but but actually we need to get

125
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,330
better at it we need to have proper true

126
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:33,438
detection we need to kind of be a bit

127
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,419
more like Columbo

128
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,699
instead of taking what the screen says

129
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,169
we need to be a bit more and just one

130
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:41,389
more thing that's the only impression I

131
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:44,830
ever do by the way that important yours

132
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:48,110
but he's dead now so can't do it and so

133
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,300
we need to get cuter about it we need to

134
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,370
understand the technologies were being

135
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,860
sold or the technologies we use and and

136
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,659
what they can do for us rather than what

137
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,279
the salespeople have told us they can do

138
00:05:56,659 --> 00:06:00,770
and we need to have a more proactive

139
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:03,620
approach with those technologies listen

140
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,448
IDs has been about four years right it's

141
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,250
a perfect example of our industry

142
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,979
intrusion detection systems have been

143
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,930
about four years when Gartner came out

144
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:13,729
in as two thousand four or five and said

145
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,199
intrusion detection was dead what did

146
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:18,469
the industry do did we go away and

147
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,449
innovate no we changed the D to a P and

148
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:22,250
we call the intrusion prevention systems

149
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:24,680
and it was still the same things we just

150
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:28,189
stopped them in line that's the absolute

151
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,389
difference with it I'm going to call you

152
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:32,569
out a little bit and I were talking

153
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:34,430
about it before we do not innovate in

154
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:36,769
our industry enough we need to start

155
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,870
thinking outside the box which is why

156
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:41,180
when Omri gave us present

157
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,550
today I was so pleased that somebody

158
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:49,790
started talking about service and and

159
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:51,410
the new ways of working you haven't

160
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:56,660
missed much guys I was just asking about

161
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:59,350
little Eva Thomas so it really is

162
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:02,570
difficult to identify a Catania network

163
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,920
you know gone are the days when there's

164
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,240
a script kiddie who's baingan on your

165
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,680
front door or wandering through your

166
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,000
network

167
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,580
smashing bin lids together telling

168
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,290
everybody where their presence is most

169
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,260
hackers are gonna like I said come in

170
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:17,090
via the noise bypass your controls and

171
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,020
then start living off the land if you

172
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,650
don't know what living off the land

173
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:24,049
means within a an attacker context it

174
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,630
means what other tools are at their

175
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,940
disposal on the network already or on

176
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,980
the systems like PowerShell and things

177
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,990
like that where they can move laterally

178
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:37,670
from machine to machine to where they

179
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:39,440
need to get to and and we we are really

180
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,360
difficult with that from a post breech

181
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,790
strategy of actually being able to spot

182
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,610
that and actually look at the ways of

183
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:49,670
being able to capture sean talked about

184
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:52,070
it earlier on in tropics detection type

185
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,690
controls or honey pots or honey nets if

186
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:59,450
you don't enough to remember them one

187
00:07:53,690 --> 00:08:01,190
way to do it also this there's a lack of

188
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,110
evidence it's the who what why where

189
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:07,219
when and how tight questions afterwards

190
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:09,200
in this propensity to capture everything

191
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,610
that goes on on the network we're still

192
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,710
not doing enough with answering those

193
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,900
questions primarily I believe because

194
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:16,729
we're not focusing enough time in the

195
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,890
skills and the expertise of the people

196
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:21,560
who do it and we want to relying more on

197
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:24,169
the machines or the technology you know

198
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,580
if you don't fully understand how to do

199
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,200
what you do and you're not going to

200
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,310
fully understand how to get the best out

201
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:33,409
of that machine or that bit of

202
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:36,200
technology and then ubiquitously the

203
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:38,799
lack of skills resource we are in an

204
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,450
industry that we hear this all the time

205
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,949
my wages aren't going up despite of it

206
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,870
by the way but we are in an industry

207
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,480
where we hear this all the time and I

208
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,460
think it's it's a slight mist or

209
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,950
because yes we have a lack of skills

210
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,930
resource but I think is the actual

211
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,760
skills to do the types of things we want

212
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:58,310
to do because we're still doing the same

213
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,710
thing we did 20 years ago and expecting

214
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,689
different outcomes and not my friends is

215
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:10,010
the idea and Andy and the actual

216
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:12,920
definition of idiocy it really is so the

217
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:16,670
so what question where we concentrate on

218
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:19,550
money way where we concentrate is on the

219
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,380
the dwell time issue now it doesn't

220
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,300
matter who you listen to whether it's

221
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,100
that food comes from gone or whether

222
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,280
it's fire I fight I publish a ninety

223
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,530
nine day figure anywhere between three

224
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,689
months and closer to nine months is a

225
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:35,540
pretty big average dwell time that

226
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:38,030
somebody will be on your network just

227
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:40,610
pleasing themselves wandering about

228
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:42,530
moving from machine to machine not being

229
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,140
caught and when you think it's not going

230
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:48,079
to happen to me well you know we only

231
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:51,949
have to bring the the big names Equifax

232
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,930
Target Citrix pick any one of them a lot

233
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,360
of them had this dwell time issue

234
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:58,459
I think target in fact were told by Dell

235
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,260
SecureWorks was their MSSP I think at

236
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,090
the time they told them of some

237
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,880
suspicious activity several times

238
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:06,500
because of the Ilia fall umhum because

239
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,630
of the issue with the noise and it

240
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,520
became anesthetized to it they didn't do

241
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,680
anything about it they then became the

242
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,829
subject of a massive breach and more

243
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,560
often than not nearly sixty percent of

244
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:20,450
the time the indications of the breach

245
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,369
or the dwell time does not come from an

246
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:25,720
internal source Citrix is a perfect

247
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:28,040
perfect example it was an externally

248
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,950
security research and firm that told

249
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,480
Citrix about and then Citrix did some

250
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,450
tap dance and Shabbat to be in the FBI

251
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,000
that all yeah

252
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:40,160
depends who you want to believe there

253
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,410
but the real goal here is to reduce that

254
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,930
to L time because studies have shown

255
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,550
that actually if you can reduce the

256
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:50,030
dwell time and you can't see that there

257
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:53,120
but that's from the Aberdeen Group they

258
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:55,610
did a bit of research back in 2016 and

259
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,100
if you can get it and contain it and

260
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:00,800
spot it and do something within a day

261
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,890
the actual reduction in the costs your

262
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,359
business is magnificent get sixty days

263
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,649
out

264
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,029
and you've got a full business impact

265
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:09,829
whatever that may mean to the business

266
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:11,180
whatever those cost me into the business

267
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:13,699
I'm not going to type figures to that

268
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,170
because everybody tries to do that every

269
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,300
business is different from that point of

270
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,229
view and I will say that every business

271
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,620
is different

272
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:23,029
ie they didn't it to do different things

273
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,550
security the way the hacked the way they

274
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:27,920
get in the way they move around tcp/ip

275
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:31,219
is the same in every business by the way

276
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,319
it is no different no difference no

277
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,829
business is special from that point of

278
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,920
view so you can see trying to eliminate

279
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:44,930
12-time or catch it as soon as possible

280
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:47,420
is an important side of things three

281
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,849
fundamental truths I think that we need

282
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,620
moving forward in our industry you need

283
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,480
an assumed breach you are going to be

284
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,000
breached if you're not breach you will

285
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,800
be breached soon and why is that largely

286
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,120
the background image there is supposedly

287
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,019
another Great Wall of China was

288
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,630
supposedly to to evoke a castle a

289
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:07,430
perimeter approach organizations still

290
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,550
have a perimeter approach to security

291
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:12,649
they want to build higher turrets

292
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,719
thicker walls wider and deeper moats

293
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:17,019
when the enemy is either got somebody

294
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,339
already on the inside or has land to fly

295
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:21,709
so you're not defending against the

296
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:22,850
right things so you need to assume that

297
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:24,829
and if you're not going to be breached

298
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,529
guess what you probably is their party's

299
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:29,060
going to be breached cloud hop a perfect

300
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:31,279
example has anybody seen the cloud

301
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,890
hopper report around the MSSP thank you

302
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,420
very much if you haven't seen it go to

303
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:37,220
my LinkedIn feed there's a bit on there

304
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,469
it was just released by the Reuters guys

305
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,199
really great bit of work talked about

306
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:44,690
top eight MSPs in the world every single

307
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:46,880
one of them compromised from from their

308
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:48,500
third party infrastructure which then

309
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,630
went on to compromise their customers

310
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,640
and these are the people you put your

311
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,740
trust in security and by the way these

312
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,480
are not small names these are not

313
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:02,269
startups you've never heard of these are

314
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:03,320
the big boys the fundamental truth we

315
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:05,269
are the weakest link

316
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:09,199
Mitnick said it there's no path for

317
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:12,589
stupidity it's really true it doesn't

318
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:14,060
matter how many times I tell my dad not

319
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:17,690
to click on a link in an email

320
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,560
I must have rebuilt his PC three or four

321
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,139
times

322
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,029
and you know what the the one thing that

323
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:26,290
you can never recover from is seeing

324
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:30,009
your parents internet safe and history

325
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:37,930
just absolutely kills you it really does

326
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:40,189
honestly I just need a moment I'm

327
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,388
finally in secure software is eating the

328
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:43,839
world if it wasn't we wouldn't have a

329
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:46,699
career bless them bless those coders but

330
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,889
we still do it today right we still do

331
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:50,329
it you know I can well somebody will

332
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:52,790
talk about get up somebody talk about

333
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:55,399
coal deposit to you somebody we using

334
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:58,579
somebody else's cold most of the time

335
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:00,620
but it's worth were accepting that

336
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:02,839
that's okay we're not doing really any

337
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,339
checks on it holistically we may stick

338
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:05,720
three or four modules together and go

339
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:07,459
does that do or on - yeah brilliant

340
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,809
let's not worry about everything else

341
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:10,279
because that's a bit of a cost we don't

342
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:12,649
really want to think about at this

343
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,990
moment in time but as long as those

344
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:17,300
three elements are there you will be

345
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,910
breached people will do dumb shit and

346
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:29,000
we've got insecure code we'll always

347
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:31,870
have a career great news folks so I've

348
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,389
set the scene I've give you an idea of

349
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:39,410
why I think just using a logs only

350
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:43,100
approaches a little bit dark ages can I

351
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:44,750
say what next where must me go from an

352
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,819
evolution point of view and it is

353
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,079
evolution it's not innovation against

354
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:51,800
something we were talking about earlier

355
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:54,290
on we are I think most organizations are

356
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,910
in that left hand side and not doing

357
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,430
that left hand side very well whether

358
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:00,170
you're an MS SP or na or whether an

359
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:03,410
internal customer trying to build their

360
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:05,540
own internal sock which again puzzles me

361
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,189
slightly slightly puzzles me that white

362
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,860
people want to reinvent the wheel

363
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:12,469
I get the use case for say it mums I do

364
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,749
get it for big organizations however I

365
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,519
think a lot of it is hubris I think a

366
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:18,019
lot of is a C so trying to make a name

367
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:21,079
for himself most of the time if I'm

368
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:23,899
going to be honest with you or a CTO so

369
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:25,248
almost like it's almost like for those

370
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:27,589
of you old enough to remember the Haynes

371
00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:30,889
manuals of how you fix cars

372
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:32,000
it's almost but it's how I how I got

373
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,490
through my having mechanical

374
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,540
to ship actually it's almost like buying

375
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,290
one of those and thinking you're a

376
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:41,599
mechanic it just isn't okay so we need

377
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:43,370
to evolve we need to get more proactive

378
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,560
we need to be on the front foot a little

379
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:48,280
bit more and we need to we need to ride

380
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,989
that curve towards a more of a hunting

381
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,550
approach going after the bad guys

382
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,500
instead of waiting for the bad guys to

383
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,329
come to you that doesn't mean a halfback

384
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,340
approach you by the way that means

385
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,680
taking a proactive approach on your

386
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,020
network knowing what the signs of bad

387
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,810
are and educating yourself on that and

388
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,699
if you can't educate yourself on that

389
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:10,430
partner up with somebody whilst you ramp

390
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,050
up your education you know this isn't a

391
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,420
sales a lift for me partner up with

392
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,910
people who are good at that stuff threat

393
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,459
hunting is difficult by the way you know

394
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,180
it takes a skill it's not a product it's

395
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,390
a mindset

396
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:26,089
it's a hypothec I can say it's a

397
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:28,220
hypothesis that a threat hunter will

398
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:30,350
come up with and then test it's like the

399
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,580
scientific method you know you're

400
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,600
looking for certain things are you

401
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,860
looking for absence of certain things

402
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,350
but what does that mean for many

403
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,230
organizations I'll quickly scan through

404
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:44,540
this so we get to the end this is a

405
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,670
maturity scale again for a lot of

406
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:50,170
organizations I've worked with wick for

407
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:53,209
and talked to we're still in those

408
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,560
bottom two left-hand side to the

409
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,270
architecture side of things you might

410
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,650
have a decent security architecture or

411
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:00,140
we think we've got a decent security

412
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:03,770
architecture and we might have some kind

413
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:06,139
of passive defense a seem if you will an

414
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:08,359
outsource their party provides a collect

415
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,709
and logs not really doing anything for

416
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,958
you but you're compliant

417
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:12,800
right because compliance equals security

418
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:17,000
doesn't it

419
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:19,849
no okay good where we need to move from

420
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,959
a maturity point of view is over to the

421
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:23,030
right-hand side we need to get more

422
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,620
active we need to get more involved you

423
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,149
know the one thing a business does know

424
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:28,790
is what it needs to operate that

425
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:31,520
business and that can then translate

426
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:33,470
into what's important to you what you

427
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,060
need to look out for and if you are

428
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,390
working with a partner you can discuss

429
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:40,220
that with the partner how hot is now

430
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,960
just all of a sudden got a little bit

431
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,750
hot but you can discuss that with a

432
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,840
partner and how that material

433
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:50,210
itself in terms of what you need from

434
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,470
them don't be afraid to ask questions of

435
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:54,110
them by the way if they come in and go

436
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,960
I've got this artificial intelligence

437
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:58,789
blur or this machine learn and blur

438
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,260
ask them what algorithm they use in

439
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:02,440
their machine learning ask them the

440
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,549
difference between AI and machine learn

441
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,549
sales guys you won't be able to tell you

442
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:09,650
they'll be stumped and then you've got

443
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:11,030
them then because then you've called

444
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:14,720
them out on their bullshit that they

445
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:17,510
regularly turn out you know and you

446
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,570
should do it I'm in sales were ok we're

447
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:22,640
all insert I'm in sales but I try and go

448
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:24,320
into a customer and talk to customer the

449
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,900
pains they have rather than trying to

450
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,668
sell them on some kind of snake oil you

451
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,470
know because it's my reputation at the

452
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:32,600
end of the day I'm a walk out the room

453
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:37,490
lay things like you do scouser half

454
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:38,740
right or my professional integrity is

455
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,900
the only thing I've got in this business

456
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,159
you know pin your sales guys to the wall

457
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:48,320
when they come in and try and cellular

458
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:52,669
type of stuff what more do we need to

459
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:55,250
see I think today our picture is this

460
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:57,830
from a spend point of view most of the

461
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,539
spend is on prevention there's not

462
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:02,389
enough on through monitoring and

463
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:06,350
response capabilities it is all about

464
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:08,179
the the castle analogy the motive the

465
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,070
Tourister prevention Eve even though

466
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:11,990
we've got a perimeters environment now

467
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,158
and everybody accepts that we're still

468
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:15,169
thinking that way we're not thinking

469
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:17,179
holistically we're not thinking who's

470
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:19,850
fourth fifth sixth seventh link in that

471
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:22,190
chain on that process that my business

472
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,840
requires and where they weak and how

473
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:30,220
would I spot and defend against that

474
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:32,600
type of thing a lot of the a lot of the

475
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:36,940
gardener's the ID sees the foresters

476
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:40,668
will talk about even in this spend up

477
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,530
trying to spend more on true and decent

478
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:44,780
monotone that gets you to where you need

479
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:47,658
to be try and spend a bit more on

480
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,580
response you know we all know about

481
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:51,710
Incident Response Teams well how many

482
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,610
actually have a decent one how many

483
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:57,350
trained for this all the time you know

484
00:19:54,610 --> 00:20:00,350
all of this stuff it kind of

485
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:02,480
having a slight semi career as a

486
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:05,120
footballer it slightly amazes me that we

487
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,000
do no training for cybersecurity

488
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,768
whatsoever we do no scenario-based train

489
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,230
and we don't know how we're gonna

490
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:14,570
respond we have a plan it's in a drawer

491
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:16,309
somewhere but we haven't got a clue how

492
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:22,939
we're gonna do once the sticky stuff

493
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:25,309
hits the fan you know yes sir and I'm

494
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,230
with you 100% on that one but how many

495
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:28,908
of us have actually got some kind of a

496
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:32,509
reference architecture to simulate

497
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:35,929
attacks about our enterprise the answer

498
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:38,299
is very few why is that to your point we

499
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:40,570
don't do it enough even with the

500
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:42,950
technology we've got available to us

501
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,720
listen you don't win six champions

502
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:50,529
leaves by not practicing right

503
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:53,570
no no blues no United supporters no okay

504
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:55,009
but you're right you're right we don't

505
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,200
do enough of it

506
00:20:55,009 --> 00:21:00,049
our cybersecurity awareness training it

507
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,149
consists of one hour once a year right

508
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:04,340
and you should you should then all be

509
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:06,678
experts on it you should know what to

510
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:09,139
look out for what to do what not to do

511
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:11,840
who to talk to we need to do more about

512
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:14,658
it any tools in the industry who need to

513
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,820
be speaking to our peers and try and do

514
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:19,549
from a human point of view as well try

515
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,320
not to be geeks about it we can all fall

516
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:23,539
into the geek side of things but let's

517
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:28,070
try not to be let's try and talk to them

518
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:30,139
as professionals and human beings it's

519
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,710
an interesting thing to say there's an

520
00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:36,649
economic effect called a Veblen effect

521
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:38,899
and essentially it translates into if

522
00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:43,070
something costs a lot it must be really

523
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:45,258
good and I I see a lot of what

524
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,700
organizations could be doing they could

525
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:48,740
do for a lot less than the currently

526
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,379
doing today and do it much better than

527
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,019
the service or the product that they're

528
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:56,269
getting today you know look at look at

529
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:57,769
elastic right look at ELQ the just

530
00:21:56,269 --> 00:22:01,279
bought an game and they've just released

531
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:02,690
the scene it's all free it's all free

532
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,659
you know there's a lot of that stuff out

533
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:08,059
there set on Tim bro it's all free you

534
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:09,559
know gone gone to kill yourself up on a

535
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:10,940
call in and then you will be less

536
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:12,970
reliant on logs

537
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,440
you'd be more reliant on your knowledge

538
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:17,480
you will provide a better service to

539
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,280
your customers who the business you work

540
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,960
for and guess what you'd be more

541
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,420
employable throughout the throughout the

542
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,980
lifetime of cybersecurity I keep telling

543
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,810
my boy that cybersecurity wasn't

544
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,940
available when I was a kid when I left

545
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:31,850
school I left school to be a mechanic

546
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,650
and fell into cybersecurity in

547
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,719
University John Moores University over

548
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,360
there out there and it just wasn't

549
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,430
available back in 92 it's great just

550
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,340
wonder what our kids are gonna get into

551
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:45,350
that isn't available right now you know

552
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,770
hopefully something in Europe but that's

553
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:51,919
a different conversation altogether

554
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:53,389
little bit of politics I was going to go

555
00:22:51,920 --> 00:23:00,610
all delicate and on you then but now I

556
00:22:53,390 --> 00:23:04,040
want people five minutes thank you so so

557
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:05,959
just to back up you guys can read that

558
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,480
as much as I can read it out to you

559
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:11,150
my eyesight failing as I get older as

560
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,680
well so but just to back the types of

561
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:15,620
things I've been talking about around

562
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,630
the response the detection the splitting

563
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,669
of budgets the even and out of budgets

564
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:22,790
there's a bunch of quotes there from

565
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:24,530
gardener Forester ESG and IDC some of it

566
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:27,050
talks about the types of technologies

567
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:29,060
that are reliant on logs like seam type

568
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:31,280
technologies one of our customers

569
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,860
actually calls it stupidly irrelevant

570
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,450
electronic messaging is what seemed to

571
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,659
them stands for because they just get a

572
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:41,270
barrage of alerts and if it's read just

573
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,670
fire the alert off which comes back to

574
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:45,200
my earlier point the aleph attics are

575
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,840
the things you choose start switching

576
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,060
that stuff off not just the alert

577
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,310
themselves you become a nice the ties to

578
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,810
it so you possibly miss some stuff that

579
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,760
you shouldn't be missing because you're

580
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,320
and easter ties to all that nonsense

581
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,910
that's coming through all those false

582
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:05,149
positives okay and I think that's all

583
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:06,800
I've got to say on any questions I'll

584
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:17,870
leave five minutes for questions on

585
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:19,520
anything how well do you think we're

586
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,800
doing a value proposition to the

587
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,320
business to your point about costs and

588
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:29,250
whether the spend is in the right

589
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:33,820
price retain on security investment -

590
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:35,710
Rosie that's a long time ago I don't

591
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,389
think we've moved the needle if anything

592
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:40,180
I think we've regressed I'm gonna be

593
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:42,040
honest with you we have more reliance on

594
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,390
new technologies and new approaches by

595
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,730
the way cloud is no different than

596
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:50,800
mainframe for those of you remember it

597
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:54,760
is the same thing okay um and I think

598
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:57,850
because of that we are so so eager to

599
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,230
consume new groovy stuff that were

600
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:01,480
actually still not getting the basics

601
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,620
right yeah I talked about the basics all

602
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,150
the time what are the basics me

603
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,070
understand what you're connected to you

604
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:08,080
Network understand who's accessing your

605
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:10,419
network and understand whether it's

606
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,520
vulnerable and then what the threat to

607
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:14,320
your network is from now and then do

608
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,910
stuff about her so I mean putty

609
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,040
everything all the time but putty a

610
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,730
critical stuff or at least others fear

611
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:22,180
stab at it

612
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:23,560
all right you know there's another quick

613
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,600
okay.come

614
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:31,179
we set there I'll buy a beer afterwards

615
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:35,379
another question so you're talking about

616
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:37,330
the future and you kind of given up on

617
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:40,090
the idea that developers might develop

618
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:42,960
less insecure applications completely

619
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,959
like that's a lost cause

620
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:53,140
can we have a drug test we all live in

621
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,580
hope right we all live in hope I live in

622
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,140
hope that Claudia Schiffer's gonna drive

623
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,689
me to work in a Ferrari it's probably

624
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:05,650
not gonna happen no it's a very fair

625
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:08,710
point sorry to make light of it do i my

626
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:11,560
experience tells me that we're not going

627
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:14,230
to do it anytime soon my experience

628
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:16,090
tells me that the good intentions we

629
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:18,340
have in our industry remember this is

630
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:19,780
our industry so we're kind of all in a

631
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,490
room patting each other on the back on

632
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:25,120
aren't we great we're great in security

633
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:27,970
blah blah outside people don't give a

634
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,919
shit they really don't they will do

635
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:31,630
stuff and not really care and you go

636
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,330
what about that oh that's a bit James

637
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:37,210
Bond isn't it no it's not

638
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:39,879
last week so you can't you can't even

639
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:41,950
point yeah it may be it may be the

640
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:46,240
climate we now live in that evidence and

641
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:47,649
facts are useless maybe it is an absence

642
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,460
of evidence isn't evidence of absence

643
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:53,469
right so I would like to think we could

644
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,929
let's do that lets you and I change the

645
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:57,490
world for the better okay

646
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:59,049
I don't mean we have to go and live

647
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,970
together anything like that but you know

648
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:04,860
yeah we quit Claudia and the Ferrari

649
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:13,029
within any other questions

650
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:15,428
one stir you sleep no anymore for

651
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:17,380
anymore thank you very much I'll be here

652
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:20,159
all day we'll have a pint later on

653
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,159
really
