1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:10,040
so I'm just gonna open with this image

2
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:12,590
which is basically my favorite image at

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,889
the moment because it really really sums

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:17,330
up my mental state and I'm not just

5
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:21,169
talking about me preparing this talk

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:25,399
until about five minutes ago and credit

7
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:26,779
to rag sack cuz she told me like put put

8
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:29,899
memes in the talk pop means in the talk

9
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:32,149
but memes in the talk and I was like do

10
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:35,810
I want to and that was the only

11
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:37,750
appropriate one I think and so to start

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:41,120
off with I just want to say something

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:43,070
I'm not afraid I promise I'm just

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,230
navigating impostor syndrome as an

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:52,300
industry newcomer but that's all well

16
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:55,300
and good until you know who I am so I'm

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:58,610
most often known as fruit or fruit where

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:02,150
my actual name is Chrissy Robertson I'm

19
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,590
a software engineer at a Portuguese

20
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,869
software house called critical software

21
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,520
and if you follow me on Twitter you've

22
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:11,869
probably seen me declare my love for

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:15,789
them far too often and I'm also a

24
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:15,789
moderator for the mini-hats Club and

25
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,350
it's been just over a year now and

26
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,109
that's still really good it feels like I

27
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,839
joined it last week and when I finally

28
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:28,729
wander into security I'm hoping to be

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,249
involved with malware analysis and

30
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:34,520
Incident Response I also really like

31
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:36,740
hippos and the color pink and I'm pretty

32
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,289
sure if I had a choice I would be a

33
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,699
hippo because that doesn't mean says the

34
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:46,429
female hippopotamus will do almost

35
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:51,889
anything when motivated by food and oh

36
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:56,689
yeah I'm also really done so this slide

37
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:58,969
is showing many of the times that I've

38
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:01,508
called myself done in the 18 months

39
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:04,848
before I started making this talk and

40
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:08,479
I've called myself done a million more

41
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:11,120
times since and the reason I'm saying

42
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,500
this is obviously because impostor

43
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,300
syndrome

44
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,470
but before I really get into the meat of

45
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,960
the talk I just want to give a quick

46
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:22,160
disclaimer I'm not a mental health

47
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,870
professional I've never had any

48
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,710
qualifications with mental health

49
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:30,290
treatment diagnosis or practice though I

50
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:33,950
do have experience with mental health

51
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,929
issues as I'm sure many others do and I

52
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:41,119
study psychology for a bit but that

53
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:42,830
doesn't really count probably and like

54
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,780
any suggestion with mental health what

55
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,980
works for me might not work for you or

56
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,720
works for you might not work for the

57
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,220
person sitting next to you and what

58
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,150
works for the person sitting next to you

59
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:55,450
might not work for me and and as I said

60
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,950
I'm not a mental health professional and

61
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,609
this isn't really a technical talk I'm

62
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,869
really sorry

63
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:05,080
it's basically psychology I'm not that

64
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,080
sorry

65
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:11,120
so when hands up if any of you guys have

66
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:20,090
ever felt like any of these statements

67
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:21,560
on the screen me too

68
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,280
so these are a lot of statements that

69
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:31,010
have been linked with the idea of

70
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:33,530
impostor syndrome and and it's something

71
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,329
that I wanted to kind of gauge and be a

72
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,840
bit interactive especially once I

73
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,310
realized I was after lunch I also wanted

74
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,720
to share this tweet that I saw a couple

75
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:47,120
of weeks ago on Facebook that says Metta

76
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,310
imposter syndrome when you know a lot of

77
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,500
people have impostor syndrome but you've

78
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,190
witnessed how competent they are they're

79
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,739
not like you

80
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,850
the real impostor and the reason I

81
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:57,590
wanted to share that is because

82
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,840
especially last year there was a lot of

83
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:04,070
people talking about impostor syndrome

84
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,850
on Twitter and the two very significant

85
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:09,590
examples that stuck out to me were

86
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:12,109
Stuart PAC who is one of the owners of

87
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:16,790
the many hats club and hacker fantastic

88
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:19,130
who runs my hacker house and these two

89
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:22,070
people are very prominent they're very

90
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,180
established they're very well deserving

91
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:27,360
of the positions that they're in

92
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,800
and and while it's very important that

93
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,050
people in those positions are talking

94
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,509
about how they have impostor syndrome it

95
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,880
kind of makes people in my position

96
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:39,270
where I've not even started my security

97
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:44,580
cure yet to kind of think what chance do

98
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:47,639
I have but I think the important

99
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,800
question is what is impostor syndrome so

100
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,330
it's known by a lot of things impostor

101
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,810
syndrome seems to be the more common one

102
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:57,690
these days but it's also known as the

103
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:00,740
imposter phenomenon imposter ISM fraud

104
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:03,660
syndrome and the impostor experience

105
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:06,300
it's easiest definition is feeling like

106
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:13,620
a fraud feeling like you're going to be

107
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:15,539
found out any second now um but the

108
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,580
official definition is that it's a

109
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:20,250
psychological pattern in which an

110
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,469
individual doubts the accomplishments

111
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:27,389
and has a persistent internalized fear

112
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:29,310
of being exposed as a fraud essentially

113
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:31,740
impostor syndrome is being convinced

114
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,150
that you're a fraud and that you don't

115
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,919
deserve what you've achieved and that

116
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:39,359
anything you have achieved is either the

117
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:43,260
result of luck or deception or sometimes

118
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:47,550
both the concept was originally coined

119
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:51,449
in 1978 by dr. Pauline our clients and

120
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:53,520
dr. Suzanne a Ines and early research

121
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:57,330
focused on a prevalence in high

122
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,479
achieving women but originally not

123
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:03,620
usually but more recently it's been

124
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:07,320
found that there's no real gender bias

125
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:10,770
but that there is essentially a reaction

126
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,719
to stimuli and events it's not

127
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,448
considered a mental disorder but an

128
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,180
experience because it's not listed

129
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:20,039
within the DSM and the ICD which are two

130
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,570
diagnostic manuals used for

131
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:26,219
psychological disorders and it may be

132
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:29,190
accompanied by anxiety and depression it

133
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,349
has a comorbidity basically the best

134
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,310
friends and they run down the street

135
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:37,480
skipping hands

136
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:39,670
and it's estimated that about 70% of

137
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,900
individuals will experience impostor

138
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:44,020
syndrome at least once in their lives

139
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,570
and it can often be a result of a new

140
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,890
setting such as an academic setting a

141
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:52,180
professional setting something like this

142
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:57,180
and it's really not uncommon for

143
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:59,770
students and the feelings of guilt

144
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:07,150
involved with impostor syndrome feed a

145
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:09,039
fear of success now there's a few common

146
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:13,000
ideas and statements in individuals

147
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,040
experiencing impostor syndrome so some

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,020
people with impostor syndrome may write

149
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,670
off their success as a result of the

150
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:23,560
good education they were able to receive

151
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:24,970
and many believe that it's not right or

152
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,950
fair to them to be in a better position

153
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:31,900
than a friend or someone that they love

154
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:33,700
and some have also stated that in their

155
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,039
childhood they were referred to as the

156
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:39,400
smart one the talented one the

157
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:45,460
responsible one the sensitive one the

158
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:48,580
good one or even our favorite and in

159
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:50,680
1985 clance de flight went further into

160
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,020
the research and defined a scale to

161
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,890
measure characteristics of impostor

162
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:59,020
syndrome so she talked about things like

163
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:02,200
the imposter cycle the need to feel

164
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:04,380
special or be the best kind of

165
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,130
competitive nature if you will

166
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,719
characteristics of Superman or

167
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,159
superwoman but I didn't really find

168
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,570
anything that really defined that much

169
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:15,670
further so I'm not entirely sure what

170
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:19,690
they mean and a fear of failure a denial

171
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:23,080
of ability I am dumb and discounting

172
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:24,990
praise so like refusing compliments not

173
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,669
accepting them not believing them and

174
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:34,750
also feeling fear and guilt about

175
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:37,000
success she determined she said that it

176
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:40,150
determines if characteristics of fear

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,620
are present and to why extinct so there

178
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,600
are three characteristics of fear that

179
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,490
she really looked at so a fair

180
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,170
evaluation a fear of

181
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,050
not continue being able to continue the

182
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:54,069
success and affairs of not being as

183
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:56,359
capable as others so comparing yourself

184
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,190
plants also noted that the

185
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,720
characteristics may vary between

186
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:06,260
individuals and that she felt only two

187
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,330
of the six things in the impulsive scale

188
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,950
had to be present to suggest that an

189
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:14,120
individual suffers from impostor

190
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:16,070
syndrome and so I wanted to talk about

191
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,680
the impostor cycle especially because

192
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:23,029
this really really feeds into imposter

193
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:26,569
syndrome constantly and and I'm gonna be

194
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:31,070
honest I did this exact thing when doing

195
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:32,720
this talk so Kant's proposed that when

196
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,120
an achievement based task is given to

197
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,190
someone suffering from impostor syndrome

198
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,160
they'll go in one of two ways they'll

199
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,830
either over-prepare in which case when

200
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,790
they succeed they'll write it off as a

201
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:48,980
result of hard work and as such they'll

202
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:52,279
have no ill have no effects on the

203
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:54,829
individuals personal perception of

204
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:57,490
success and they'll discount positive

205
00:09:54,829 --> 00:10:00,439
feedback or they'll procrastinate and

206
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,380
then towards the deadline they'll make a

207
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,399
frantic effort to complete the job and

208
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,040
they'll have a brief period of

209
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,050
accomplishment and feeling of relief

210
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:12,589
before they start writing it off as look

211
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,719
and then again there's no effect on the

212
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:15,110
individual's perception of personal

213
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,770
success

214
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:21,560
and any positive feedback is discounted

215
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:24,199
and then as another task comes in the

216
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:28,880
cycle continues and this cycle feeds

217
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:31,190
impostor syndrome every cycle basically

218
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,939
causes an accumulation of perceived

219
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,660
fraudulence

220
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:37,760
oh this was looking especially if the

221
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,439
individual tends to go more towards the

222
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:44,110
procrastination side than the over

223
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:52,730
preparation side increased self doubts

224
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:57,980
depression and anxiety sorry and be any

225
00:10:52,730 --> 00:11:00,220
increased success and

226
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:03,920
would lead to an intensification of

227
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,840
feeling like a fraud and the experienced

228
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,180
Court would cause an individual to be

229
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:11,180
haunted by their perceived lack of

230
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:14,390
ability essentially they continue to

231
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:19,729
believe they will be exposed and that

232
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:23,300
belief keeps the cycle moving but fruit

233
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:25,460
what do what do I have impostor syndrome

234
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:29,719
what do if I'm following this cycle what

235
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:32,960
do well the short answer is therapy the

236
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,800
long answer group therapy with a side

237
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,990
order of cognitive behavioral therapy in

238
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,500
the 1978 paper produced by clients and

239
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,450
IIMs

240
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,850
they proposed that a therapeutic

241
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:47,030
approach was the best approach to manage

242
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:48,980
impostor syndrome and they proposed a

243
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:51,280
group setting was best as that was what

244
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,780
the use was their study participants and

245
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,819
they thought that it came to a

246
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,970
realization in the participants that

247
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:02,110
they were not alone in their feelings of

248
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:05,540
being a fraud of not belonging

249
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:09,140
academically professionally with their

250
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,969
achievements whatever happened the study

251
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:14,500
participants were given homework

252
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:16,700
assignments between sessions such as

253
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:20,060
recounting all of the people that they

254
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,470
felt they had deceived and what they

255
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,619
felt they had done to deceive those

256
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,880
people and writing down any positive

257
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,570
feedback they received to attune

258
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,520
sessions to then discuss why the

259
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:34,130
positive feedback had been given and

260
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:38,420
what about it made them perceive it

261
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:40,670
negatively these sessions also included

262
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:43,099
cognitive behavioral therapy which if

263
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,810
you're not familiar is challenging

264
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,820
negative thoughts and reframing them to

265
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:49,640
be positive it's also used with

266
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:54,260
depression and other self-doubt and

267
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:56,500
self-destructive disorders so for

268
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:59,420
example I might fail this exam is

269
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:02,000
challenged to become I will do well on

270
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,280
this exam it's quite difficult to do

271
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,430
especially on your own because it

272
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,470
involves being very mindful and aware of

273
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,489
your thought processes and being able to

274
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:14,220
catch the negative thoughts and stop

275
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:20,160
and change them before they complete

276
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:22,230
themselves consonance want the

277
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,519
extracting self belt helped eliminate

278
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,589
imposter ism

279
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,569
so essentially believing in yourself

280
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:32,459
more made you feel like you weren't a

281
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:40,079
fraud which I'm sorry for the language

282
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:42,809
but no in 2013 a researcher called

283
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,118
queena hyung I have no idea from saying

284
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:47,910
that right and looked at intrinsic

285
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:49,470
motivation behind impostor syndrome and

286
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,230
she proposed an alternate treatment of

287
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:54,720
affirmations to improve self-worth so

288
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:57,300
again looking at the same idea make

289
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,679
yourself like yourself you won't think

290
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:04,170
you're a fraud so she proposed specific

291
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,850
examples in her paper and I'm thinking

292
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:10,290
these are probably examples that she was

293
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:12,569
using herself and so for example I want

294
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,579
to receive that degree I won't give up

295
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:18,569
and have I have too much pride to walk

296
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:20,489
away if I can do this I will be able to

297
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:24,839
help others in the future and work with

298
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:28,980
people as motivated as I am I know I can

299
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:31,379
do this she also suggested learning how

300
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,529
to be your own person because obviously

301
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:36,689
passive imposter ISM involves constant

302
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:39,569
comparison to other people in your

303
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:40,980
industry in your class wherever you are

304
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:43,079
in that stage of life

305
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,059
so in learning to become your own person

306
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:47,489
and just challenging yourself to be the

307
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:51,299
better you you kind of break that

308
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:54,089
element of the cycle and she also

309
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:57,059
believed that if you were learned how to

310
00:14:54,089 --> 00:15:00,230
believe and accept compliments it would

311
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:02,759
kind of stop the process of discounting

312
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:08,490
positive feedback allowing it to come

313
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:10,799
into the brain and accepting it and I

314
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:13,860
think it's all well and good talking

315
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,730
about the clinical research but I think

316
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,179
it's time for my story

317
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:22,239
and so I was a high achieving student in

318
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:26,379
high school my GCSEs I got 13 a start to

319
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:29,949
see which is very good and for example

320
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:32,459
my teacher French was predicted me for

321
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:39,419
an a my dad told me I wouldn't get any

322
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:42,069
results day I call him French a star um

323
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:44,739
but at that same time I discovered I had

324
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:46,540
extreme exam anxiety and a part of that

325
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:50,459
came from the expectations my parents

326
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:53,919
had on me I wasn't allowed to fail I

327
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:56,290
went on to college and I tried to kind

328
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:58,239
of split between a levels and BTech

329
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,579
which allowed me to kind of do some

330
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:04,419
coursework do some exams but not all

331
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:05,979
exams and completely destroy myself the

332
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:08,919
college pressured me into doing just

333
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,350
exams and just a-levels with the

334
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:15,399
phrasing but your grades are so good you

335
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:21,069
should be on a levels yeah but I'm

336
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:22,989
trying not to die as a result at the end

337
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:25,509
of my first year availables they didn't

338
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:27,699
go as well as I wanted them to they I

339
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:28,660
passed everything some of them by the

340
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:34,809
skin of my teeth

341
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:36,160
and it was not great and I wasn't going

342
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:38,499
to be able to get the grades I wanted to

343
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,539
go to university or the universities I

344
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:46,269
wanted so I moved to a BTech

345
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:48,220
and nearly failed and part of that was

346
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:51,249
because I was had a major depressive

347
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:53,769
episode in second year and I was

348
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:56,799
struggling to do much of anything let

349
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:58,629
alone coursework and part of that was

350
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,239
because the IT department at my college

351
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:03,579
unfortunately was not particularly great

352
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:06,429
and as a result of the treatment I got

353
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:08,319
in college I swore off IT completely and

354
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:08,799
anything computer related for that

355
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,099
matter

356
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:16,510
I went off and trained to be a chef for

357
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:21,039
a while and I had a trial at a missional

358
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:22,720
restaurant in Chester and very quickly

359
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,230
the same thing that caused me problems

360
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,730
with exams caused me problems there too

361
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,640
except it evolved into performance

362
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,350
anxiety

363
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,640
basically I got one thing wrong belly

364
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:39,370
wrong and immediately had a panic attack

365
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:42,580
which you know not great in the kitchen

366
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:43,719
not particularly safe so I realized this

367
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,110
isn't going to be safe

368
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:51,370
and I sat myself down and I said what do

369
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:52,540
I find interesting ransomware quite

370
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,479
literally that was the only thing I

371
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:57,610
thought ransomware and so I wanted to IT

372
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,420
support to kind of get a basis back into

373
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:04,149
IT again and in that time I was studying

374
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:06,550
security I made friends with people in

375
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,890
security I went to conferences I joined

376
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:13,720
the many hats Club I became a moderator

377
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:16,240
at the many hats Club and and now I'm a

378
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:24,820
software engineer somehow I don't know

379
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:27,130
how I can't code but okay um but that's

380
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,050
impostor syndrome still telling me I

381
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:33,550
can't go to somehow I'm a software

382
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:35,740
engineer and it's hard but one thing

383
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:38,950
that I found helped me with impostor

384
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:41,290
syndrome is when someone gives me a

385
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:44,830
compliment towards my work or towards a

386
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:47,950
talk or towards something anything they

387
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:50,169
smile they say thank you and I'm not and

388
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:53,080
the nodding is probably the most

389
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,790
important part because nodding

390
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,270
subconsciously makes your brain agree

391
00:18:54,790 --> 00:19:00,310
with whatever you're nodding to so by

392
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:05,860
nodding over time your brain starts to

393
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:08,020
think yes yes this is true so that's the

394
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:13,060
hope anyway we have yet to see if that's

395
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:16,990
gonna work so these are some of the

396
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:19,270
sources I used so the two p22 of the

397
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:22,770
papers I looked at the 1978 one by

398
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:26,320
Clanton Ames and the 2013 1 by hung and

399
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:28,720
and also I used Wikipedia fairly

400
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,280
extensively because despite what my

401
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,640
school told me Wikipedia is a really

402
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:36,220
good resource and and I wanted to just

403
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,730
kind of close it up a bit on this quote

404
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:42,490
I found from Maisie Williams when she

405
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:45,040
gave a talk at TEDx Manchester

406
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,170
and that says trust that you are good

407
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:50,080
enough if there's one thing that I've

408
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:54,900
learned is that there truly is a place

409
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,899
for everyone thank you

410
00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:00,649
[Applause]
